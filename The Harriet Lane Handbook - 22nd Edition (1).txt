Preface
“Why this child? Why this disease? Why now?”
—Barton Childs, MD
The Harriet Lane Handbook was first developed in 1953 after Harrison
Spencer (chief resident in 1950–1951) suggested that residents should
write a pocket-­sized “pearl book.” As recounted by Henry Seidel, the first
editor of The Harriet Lane Handbook, “Six of us began without funds and
without [the] supervision of our elders, meeting sporadically around a table
in the library of the Harriet Lane Home.” The product of their efforts was
a concise yet comprehensive handbook that became an indispensable
tool for the residents of the Harriet Lane Home. Ultimately, Robert Cooke
(department chief, 1956–1974) realized the potential of the Handbook,
and, with his backing, the fifth edition was published for widespread distribution by Year Book. Since that time, the handbook has been regularly
updated and rigorously revised to reflect the most up-­to-­date information
and available clinical guidelines. It has grown from a humble Hopkins
resident “pearl book” to become a nationally and internationally respected
clinical resource. Now translated into many languages, the handbook is still
intended as an easy-­to-­use manual to help pediatricians provide current
and comprehensive pediatric care.
Today, The Harriet Lane Handbook continues to be updated and
revised by house officers for house officers. Recognizing the limit to what
can be included in a pocket guide, additional information has been placed
online and for use via mobile applications. The online-­only content includes
references, expanded text, and additional tables, figures, and images.
In addition to including the most up-­to-­date guidelines, practice
parameters, and references, we will highlight some of the most important
improvements in the twenty-­second edition of The Harriet Lane Handbook:
The Emergency Management and Trauma, Burn, and Common Critical
Care Emergencies chapters have been reorganized. The Emergency and
Critical Care Management chapter now focuses on the medical management of common critical care emergencies, while the management of
trauma, including burns, has been consolidated into the Traumatic Injuries
chapter.
The Development, Behavior, and Mental Health chapter has been
separated into two chapters with expanded content: Behavior, Development,
and Developmental Disability and Psychiatry, reflecting the growing need for
pediatricians to understand mental and behavioral health.
The Genetics chapter has been reorganized to present categories of
metabolic disease in easily referenced tables and to provide an organization
to different patterns and etiologies of dysmorphology.
x

Preface  xi
The Hematology chapter has been restructured with much of the text
re-­organized and expanded into tables and figures, including a new algorithmic approach to anemia. Content on the management of transfusion
reactions has been added.
The Immunoprophylaxis chapter includes a new section on vaccine
hesitancy.
The Nutrition and Growth chapter now includes expanded content on
the management of overweight and obese children, definitions of various
degrees of malnutrition, information on refeeding syndrome, and a table
with instructions on the preparation of fortified formula. Enteral formulas
have been reorganized based on clinical indications.
The Radiology chapter has been reorganized with all-­new images and
more focused content.
The Rheumatology chapter has been refocused for the general pediatrician and includes a section on the primary care management of rheumatologic diseases.
The Harriet Lane Handbook, designed for pediatric house staff, was
made possible by the extraordinary efforts of this year’s Johns Hopkins
Harriet Lane Pediatric Residency Program senior resident class. It has
been an honor to watch these fine doctors mature and refine their skills
since internship. They have balanced their busy work schedules and personal lives while authoring the chapters that follow. We are grateful to each
of them, along with their faculty advisors, who selflessly dedicated their
time to improve the quality and content of this publication. The high quality
of this handbook is representative of our residents, who are the heart and
soul of our department.

The Formulary is complete, concise, and up-­to-­date thanks to the
tireless efforts of Carlton K.K. Lee, PharmD, MPH. With each edition, he
carefully updates, revises, and improves the section. His herculean efforts
make the Formulary one of the most useful and cited pediatric drug
reference texts available.
We are grateful and humbled to have the opportunity to build on the
great work of the preceding editors: Drs. Henry Seidel, Harrison Spencer,
William Friedman, Robert Haslam, Jerry Winkelstein, Herbert Swick,
Dennis Headings, Kenneth Schuberth, Basil Zitelli, Jeffery Biller, Andrew
Yeager, Cynthia Cole, Peter Rowe, Mary Greene, Kevin Johnson, Michael
Barone, George Siberry, Robert Iannone, Veronica Gunn, Christian
Nechyba, Jason Robertson, Nicole Shilkofski, Jason Custer, Rachel Rau,
Megan Tschudy, Kristin Arcara, Jamie Flerlage, Branden Engorn, Helen
Hughes, and Lauren Kahl. Many of these previous editors continue to
make important contributions to the education of the Harriet Lane house
staff, none more than Dr. Nicole Shilkofski, our current residency program
director. We are constantly impressed by her enthusiasm for education and
her advocacy for the residents. As recent editors, Drs. Helen Hughes and
Lauren Kahl also have been instrumental in helping us to navigate this process. We hope to live up to the legacy of these many outstanding clinicians,
educators, and mentors.
An undertaking of this magnitude could not have been accomplished
without the support and dedication of some extraordinary people. First,
we would like to thank Dr. Janet Serwint, our residency program director
during our first two years of residency. Thank you for entrusting us with the
opportunity to serve as Chief Residents and Harriet Lane Handbook editors.
We would also like to offer special thanks to Kathy Mainhart, an invaluable
asset to our program. Without her guidance, we would all be lost. Thank
you to Dequira Jones and Carly Hyde, the newest additions to our program
staff. We are so appreciative of your support this past year. And last but
certainly not least, thank you to our Department Director, Dr. Tina Cheng.
We are so grateful for your mentorship and guidance­—we are honored to
help shape the Children’s Center in your vision.

Emergency and Critical Care
Management
Kelsey Stayer, MD and Lisa Hutchins, PharmD
This chapter is presented in accordance with the universal acronym C-­A-­B
(circulation, airway, breathing) to emphasize the reduction of “no blood
flow” time.1-­3 However, given the high prevalence of asphyxial cardiac
arrest in the pediatric population, ventilation remains fundamental to the
resuscitation of the critically ill child.4 This chapter serves to function as a
guide to caring for “sick” children, spanning the principles of resuscitation
and stabilization, as well as management of the most common pediatric
medical emergencies.

I. APPROACH TO THE UNRESPONSIVE CHILD
A. Circulation1-­3,5-­10
1.	Assessment
a.	Pulse: Spend no more than 10 seconds assessing pulse. Assess
brachial pulse in infants, carotid or femoral pulse in children.
b.	Perfusion: Check for pallor, mottling, or cyanosis. Capillary refill time
>2 seconds is delayed and <1 to 2 seconds or “flash” may indicate
warm shock.
c.	Rate: Bradycardia <60 beats/min with poor perfusion requires immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Tachycardia >220 beats/
min suggests pathologic tachyarrhythmia.
d.	Rhythm: Attach patient to defibrillator or continuous electrocardiography. In arrest, check rhythm every 2 minutes with minimal interruptions in chest compressions (e.g., during compressor change).
e.	Blood pressure (BP): Hypotension in a pediatric patient is a late
manifestation of circulatory compromise.
f.	Urine output: Normal output is 1.5 to 2 mL/kg/h in infants and young
children and 1 mL/kg/h in older children.
2.	Management: Initiate CPR immediately if patient is pulseless or bradycardic (<60 beats/min) with poor perfusion.
a.	Chest compressions: See Box 1.1 for an outline of the five components of high-­quality CPR.
b.	Monitoring: Continuous capnography and invasive hemodynamic
monitoring may guide effectiveness of chest compressions.
(1)	Target end-­tidal CO2 (EtCO2) >20 mmHg. If consistently less than,
improve compressions and assess for excessive ventilation.
(2)	Abrupt and sustained rise in EtCO2 is often observed just prior to
clinical return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

4  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
BOX 1.1
FIVE COMPONENTS OF HIGH-­QUALITY CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION
“Push fast”: Target rate of 100–120 compressions/min
“Push hard”: Target depth of at least ⅓ anteroposterior diameter of chest
• P
 lace step stool at side of bed to assist compressor
• Slide backboard under patient or place on hard surface
• Use the compression technique that achieves the best results
• Consider two-­handed, one-­handed, two-­finger, or two-­thumb-­
encircling hands techniques
• Aim for 1 fingerbreadth below intermammary line in infants, 2 fingerbreadths in prepubertal children, and the lower half of the sternum in
adolescents
• Allow full chest recoil between compressions
• Minimize interruptions in chest compressions
• Rotate compressor every 2 min or sooner if fatigued
• Check cardiac rhythm at time of compressor change
• Avoid excessive ventilation
• If no advanced airway (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway, tracheostomy) secured, perform 30:2 compression-­ventilation ratio (with single
rescuer or for any adolescent/adult) or 15:2 ratio (in an infant/child only if 2
rescuers present)
• If advanced airway secured, give one breath every 6–8 sec with continuous compressions
• Ventilation volume should produce no more than minimal, visible chest rise
•
•

(3)	If a patient has an indwelling arterial catheter, assess waveform
for feedback to evaluate chest compressions. Target diastolic BP
>25 mmHg in infants and >30 mmHg in children.
c.	Defibrillation: Shockable arrest rhythms include ventricular fibrillation
and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Nonshockable arrest rhythms
include asystole, pulseless electrical activity, and bradycardia with
poor perfusion.
(1)	Use age-­and size-­appropriate pads as recommended per
manufacturer.
(2)	Initial shock dose is 2 J/kg, second dose is 4 J/kg, subsequent
doses are ≥4 J/kg (maximum 10 J/kg or adult maximum dose).
d.	Cardioversion: A synchronized electrical shock delivered for hemodynamically unstable patients with tachyarrhythmias (i.e., supraventricular
tachycardia, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia) and palpable pulses.
(1)	Initial dose is 0.5 to 1 J/kg. Increase to 2 J/kg if ineffective,
repeating doses if necessary. Reevaluate diagnosis if rhythm does
not convert to sinus.
(2)	Consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for
elective cardioversion for stable patients with tachyarrhythmias.
e.	Resuscitation
(1)	
Access: Place intraosseous access immediately if in arrest or if
intravenous (IV) access difficult.

(a)	If previously established, central access is preferred for drug
administration.
(b)	Endotracheal tube (ETT) drug administration is acceptable
if required. Lidocaine, epinephrine, atropine, and naloxone
(LEAN) and vasopressin can be administered via endotracheal
route.
(2)	
Pharmacotherapy: See Table 1.1 detailing medications for
pediatric resuscitation. If actual body weight is unavailable, use
length-­based habitus-­modified (e.g., Mercy method, PAWPER
tape) estimation methods, parental estimates, or length-­based
(e.g., Broselow tape) estimation methods, in order of accuracy.
(3)	
Fluids: Administer isotonic crystalloid for treatment of shock even
if BP is normal.
(a)	Administer up to 60 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid in 20 mL/kg
increments in non-neonates during the first 20 minutes until
perfusion improves. Frequently reassess for hepatomegaly,
pulmonary crackles, and respiratory distress.
(b)	Special consideration for cardiogenic shock:
(i)	Administer an initial fluid bolus of 5 to 10 mL/kg over
10 to 20 minutes if cardiac insufficiency suspected or
unknown (consider in neonate).
(ii)	Be prepared to support oxygenation and ventilation in
case of pulmonary edema.
(c)	Special consideration for septic shock: Specific goals of
therapy include ScvO2 (central venous saturation) ≥70%,
adequate BP, normalized heart rate (HR), and appropriate
end-­organ perfusion.
f.	Extracorporeal-CPR (E-­CPR): Rapid deployment of venoarterial (VA)
or venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
to artificially provide oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation as a
means of CPR for in-­hospital arrest refractory to conventional interventions. Contraindications are limited but may include extremes of
prematurity or low birth weight, lethal chromosomal abnormalities,
uncontrollable hemorrhage, or irreversible brain damage. Should not
be offered if likely to be futile.
B. Airway and Breathing1,7,11-­17
1.	Assessment
a.	Airway patency: Perform head tilt and chin lift or jaw thrust to open
airway. Avoid overextension in infants.
b.	Spontaneous respirations: Assess spontaneous patient effort.
(1)	If breathing regularly, place patient in recovery position (turn onto
side).
(2)	If the patient has a palpable pulse but inadequate breathing,
provide a 1-­second breath every 3 to 5 seconds.
c.	Adequacy of respiration: Evaluate for symmetric chest rise. Auscultate
for equal breath sounds with good aeration.

d.	Distress: Recognize tachypnea, grunting, flaring, retractions, stridor,
or wheeze. Infants may exhibit head bobbing.
2.	Securing airway
a.	Bag-­mask ventilation (BVM): May be used indefinitely if ventilating
effectively.
(1)	Avoid pushing mask down, which can obstruct airway. Bring face
into mask.
(2)	Consider oropharyngeal airway in the unconscious patient with
obstruction. Correct size will extend from corner of mouth to
mandibular angle.
(3)	Consider nasopharyngeal airway in the conscious (gag reflex
intact) or unconscious patient with obstruction. Correct size will
extend from tip of nose to tragus of ear.
(4)	Cricoid pressure (Sellick maneuver) may be used to minimize
gastric inflation and aspiration. Avoid excess pressure leading to
tracheal obstruction.
b.	Laryngeal mask airway (LMA): Supraglottic airway placed blindly.
Useful to emergently secure access to a difficult airway.
(1)	Use manufacturer-­specific weight-­based mask size estimation
systems or the combined width of the patient’s index, middle,
and ring fingers to estimate mask size.
(2)	Continuous chest compressions can be performed once LMA is
placed.
c.	Endotracheal intubation: Rapid sequence intubation is indicated
in patients presenting with (presumed) full stomach. Immediately
sequential sedation and neuromuscular blockade help to avert the
need for positive pressure ventilation, minimizing aspiration risk.
(1)	
Preparation: Always have a secondary plan to manage the airway
if intubation is unsuccessful.
(a)	
Preoxygenation: Deliver 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather
mask for at least 3 minutes. Children have higher oxygen
consumption than adults and can rapidly become hypoxemic.
(b)	Equipment: Collect monitoring, suctioning, and oxygen delivery equipment.
(i)	If available, quantitative EtCO2 is recommended as primary method to confirm ventilation.
(ii)	Place suction catheter at head of bed. Set suction device
from −80 mmHg to −120 mmHg.
(iii)	Consider nasogastric tube for stomach decompression.
See Chapter 4 for placement.
(c)	
Airway supplies: Both cuffed and uncuffed ETTs are acceptable. Cuffed tubes may decrease risk of aspiration.
(i)	If available, use a length-­based estimator (e.g., Broselow
tape) of ETT size and laryngoscope blade size.
(ii)	To estimate age-­based ETT size (internal diameter) for
patients 2 to 10 years:

Chapter 1 Emergency and Critical Care Management   9
	 	

Cuffed ETT (mm) = (age in years / 4) + 3.5
Uncuffed ETT (mm) = (age in years / 4) + 4.0

(iii)	To approximate depth of insertion:

(iv)	Choose laryngoscope blade type and size based on
patient age and airway.
(v)	Straight (i.e., Miller) blades are typically reserved for
children <2 years age or difficult airways.
[1]	Miller #00-­1 for premature to 2 months age
[2]	Miller #1 for 3 months to 3 years age
[3]	Miller #2 for >3 years age
(vi)	Curved (i.e., Mac) laryngoscope blades are often more
effective for children >2 years age.
[1]	Mac #2 for >2 years age
[2]	Mac #3 for >8 years age
(d)	Pharmacology: See Table 1.2 for rapid sequence intubation
medications.
(e)	
Positioning: Place patient in “sniffing” position with neck
slightly extended to align the airway.
(i)	Infants and toddlers may require towel roll beneath shoulders due to large occiput.
(ii)	Children and adolescents may require towel roll beneath
neck.
(2)	
Procedure: Advanced airways should be placed by experienced
healthcare providers with appropriate training.
(a)	Confirm placement by detecting EtCO2, observing chest wall
movement, auscultating for symmetric breath sounds, and
monitoring oxygen saturation. Evaluate placement via chest
radiograph.
(3)	
Failure: Acute respiratory failure in an intubated patient may
signify Displacement of the ETT, Obstruction, Pneumothorax, or
Equipment failure (DOPE).
d.	Surgical airway: Consider needle or surgical cricothyrotomy if BVM,
endotracheal intubation, and LMA fail. If available, consult emergently with difficult airway specialists (pediatric anesthesiologist,
intensivist, and/or otolaryngologist).
3.	Oxygenation and Ventilation
a.	Oxygen delivery systems:
(1)	Low-­flow systems (e.g., nasal cannula, simple face mask) do not
meet the inspiratory flow demand of the patient. Delivery of set
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is difficult due to room air mixing.
(2)	High-­flow systems (e.g., nonrebreather, oxygen hood) do meet
the inspiratory flow demand of the patient. Measurable FiO2 is
delivered.

(3)	High-­flow nasal cannula (HFNC):
(a)	High-­flow, noninvasive respiratory support provides a heated
and humidified air-­oxygen mixture that may improve gas
exchange by providing airway-­distending pressure.
(b)	Optimal and maximal flow rates are unknown. Consensus
supports a maximum flow rate of up to 2 L/kg/min or 12 L/min
for infants and toddlers, 30 L/min for children, and up to 50
L/min for adolescents and adults.
b.	Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV):
(1)	
CPAP: Delivery of a continuous, distending positive airway pressure independent of patient inspiratory effort.
(2)	
BiPAP: Pressure-­limited ventilatory mode in which the clinician
sets an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory
positive airway pressure (EPAP).
(a)	EPAP is started at 4 to 5 cmH2O and increased to a maximum of 8 to 12 cmH2O.
(b)	Set 4 to 6 cmH2O of pressure support, or the difference
between IPAP and EPAP.
(c)	Consider setting a “backup rate,” or respiratory rate just shy
of the spontaneous respiratory rate to be delivered in case of
apnea.
c.	Mechanical Ventilation:
(1)	
Parameters:
(a)	Rate: Number of mechanical breaths delivered per minute.
(b)	FiO2: Fraction of oxygen in inspired gas.
(c)	PIP: Peak inspiratory pressure attained during respiratory
cycle.
(d)	Positive end-­expiratory pressure (PEEP): Distending pressure
that increases functional residual capacity (FRC), or volume
of gas at the end of exhalation.
(e)	Mean airway pressure (Paw): Average airway pressure over
entire respiratory cycle, which correlates to mean alveolar
volume.
(f)	Tidal volume (VT): Volume of gas delivered during inspiration.
(g)	Time: May indicate a function of time spent in inspiration (Ti),
in high pressure (Thigh), or in low pressure (Tlow).
(2)	
Modes of Ventilation:
(a)	
Controlled Ventilation: Ventilation is completely mechanical with
no spontaneous ventilation efforts expected from the patient.
(i)	Pressure-­controlled ventilation (PCV): A preset respiratory rate and Ti delivers a pressure-­limited breath (the set
pressure is maintained during inspiration). VT is determined by the preset pressure as well as lung compliance
and resistance.
(ii)	Volume-­controlled ventilation (VCV): A preset respiratory
rate and Ti delivers a preset VT.

(b)	Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV): Allows the patient to
breathe spontaneously between a preset number of (mandatory) mechanical breaths.
(i)	Synchronized IMV (SIMV): If patient initiates spontaneous
breath, mandatory breath is synchronized with patient
effort rather than spaced evenly over each minute.
(ii)	If spontaneous breathing rate is less than mandatory rate,
some mandatory breaths will be delivered in the absence
of patient effort.
(iii)	Delivered breaths may be volume regulated or pressure
limited.
(c)	Airway-­pressure-­release ventilation (APRV): Most of the
respiratory cycle is spent at a high distending pressure (a
functionally high CPAP phase) with intermittent, short release
to a low pressure for a brief ventilation phase. Spontaneous
breathing can be superimposed at any point in the cycle.
(d)	Support ventilation: Mechanical breaths support patient-­
initiated breaths, but no mandatory breaths are provided.
(i)	Pressure support (PS): Delivers a preset amount of pressure to assist spontaneous respiratory effort.
(ii)	Often used in combination with other modes of ventilation to support spontaneous breaths greater than preset
respiratory rates.
(e)	High-­frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV): Gas flow pressurizes the system to the preset Paw while a piston moves
backwards and forwards to force and withdraw a small VT
(that approximates anatomic dead space) into the lungs at
rates exceeding normal respiratory rates.
(3)	
Management: The three subdivisions of mechanical ventilatory
support are the acute (lung recruitment), maintenance (lung
recovery), and weaning phases.
(a)	
Acute: See Table 1.3 for ventilation parameter initial settings
and titration effects.
(b)	Maintenance: To avoid volutrauma, barotrauma, or oxygen
toxicity, maintain VT at 4-­6 mL/kg, PIP < 35 cmH2O, and FiO2
≤ 60%.
(c)	
Weaning:
(i)	Assess daily for clinical signs of readiness, such as spontaneous breathing efforts.
(ii)	Standard indices indicating readiness include: FiO2
<50%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, PIP <20 cmH2O, normalized
rate for age, and absence of hypercapnia or acidosis.
(iii)	The general approach combines gradual weaning of
parameters and reliance on pressure-­support modes.
(d)	Extubation:
(i)	Provide humidified inspired oxygen after extubation.

II. MANAGEMENT OF SHOCK3,5,7,11
A. Definition: Physiologic state characterized by inadequate oxygen
and nutrient delivery to meet tissue demands
1.	Compensated: Perfusion to vital organs is maintained by compensatory
mechanisms.
a.	Tachycardia is often the first and most sensitive vital sign change.
b.	Blood flow is redirected from nonvital organs and tissues to vital
organs by a selective increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR),
resulting in reduced peripheral perfusion and decreased urine
volume.
c.	Cardiac contractility increases to maintain cardiac output.
d.	Increased venous smooth muscle tone improves preload and stroke
volume.
2.	Decompensated: Perfusion to vital organs is compromised. Denoted
by hypotension, poor perfusion, oliguria/anuria, and altered mental
status.

B. Etiology: Categorized into four basic types:
1.	Hypovolemic: inadequate fluid intake, increased fluid losses (hemorrhage, gastroenteritis, burns). Assess for tachycardia, narrow pulse
pressure, delayed capillary refill, cool extremities.
2.	Cardiogenic: congenital heart disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy,
arrhythmia. Assess for increased respiratory effort from pulmonary
edema, hepatomegaly, jugular venous distension, and cyanosis.
3.	Distributive: sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic (e.g., high cervical spine
injury)
a.	Assess for tachycardia, fever, and petechial, purpuric, or urticarial
rash.
b.	Warm septic shock is characterized by bounding peripheral pulses,
flash capillary refill, and wide pulse pressure.
c.	Cold septic shock is characterized by decreased peripheral pulses,
delayed capillary refill, and narrow pulse pressure.
d.	Neurogenic shock is characterized by hypotension with a wide pulse
pressure, normal HR or bradycardia, and hypothermia.
4.	Obstructive: tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary
embolism, ductal-­dependent congenital cardiac abnormalities
a.	Early clinical presentation is indistinguishable from hypovolemic
shock. Progression of shock leads to signs and symptoms similar to
cardiogenic shock.
b.	Cardiac tamponade is characterized by muffled heart sounds and
pulsus paradoxus.
c.	Ductal-­dependent lesions may be characterized by higher preductal
versus postductal BP or arterial oxygen saturation.
C. Management
1.	Administer 100% supplemental oxygen initially regardless of oxygen
saturation to optimize oxygen delivery. Once perfusion restored, titrate
as able to avoid adverse effects from hyperoxia.
2.	See Table 1.4 for type-­and etiology-­specific pathophysiology and management of shock.
3.	See Table 1.5 for vasoactive agents to support cardiac output. Vasoactive
agents affect SVR (vasodilators and vasoconstrictors), cardiac contractility (inotropes), or HR (chronotropes). Some agents increase blood flow
via contractility and vasodilation (inodilators) or increase perfusion pressure via contractility and vasoconstriction (inoconstrictors).

III. MANAGEMENT OF COMMON EMERGENCIES
A. Anaphylaxis18
1.	Definition: Rapid-­onset (minutes to hours) usually immunoglobulin
E (IgE)-­mediated systemic allergic reaction involving multiple organ
systems, including two or more of the following:
a.	Cutaneous/mucosal (80% to 90%): flushing, urticaria, pruritis,
angioedema

TABLE 1.5
MEDICATIONS TO SUPPORT CARDIAC OUTPUT5,7,11

18  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
b.	Respiratory (70%): laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, dyspnea,
wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia
c.	Gastrointestinal (45%): vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, crampy abdominal pain
d.	Circulatory (45%): tachycardia, hypotension, syncope
2.	Management:
a.	Stop exposure to precipitating antigen.
b.	While performing A-­B-­Cs, immediately give intramuscular (IM) epinephrine into midanterolateral thigh.
(1)	
For child, administer 0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/mL solution up to a max
dose of 1 mg/dose. For adult-­sized patients, first administer 0.2
to 0.5 mg of 1 mg/mL solution, increasing as necessary up to max
single dose of 1 mg.
(2)	Autoinjector dosing: 7.5 to <15 kg use 0.1 mg, 15 to <30 kg use
0.15 mg, ≥30 kg use 0.3 mg.
(3)	Repeat dosing every 5 to 15 minutes as needed.
c.	Provide oxygen and ventilatory assistance. Consider early endotracheal intubation.
d.	Obtain IV access. For management of shock, resuscitate with 20 mL/
kg isotonic crystalloid fluid boluses and vasoactive agents as needed.
e.	Place patient in Trendelenburg position (head 30 degrees below
feet).
f.	Consider adjuvant pharmacologic agents:
(1)	
Histamine receptor antagonist: Diphenhydramine (H1-­
antagonism) and ranitidine/famotidine (H2-­antagonism)
(2)	
Corticosteroid: Methylprednisolone or dexamethasone
(3)	
Inhaled β2 agonist: Albuterol
g.	Symptoms may recur (“biphasic anaphylaxis”) up to 72 hours after
initial recovery.
(1)	Observe for a minimum of 4 to 10 hours for late-­phase symptoms.
(2)	Discharge with an epinephrine autoinjector and an anaphylaxis
action plan.
B. Upper Airway Obstruction
1.	Epiglottitis19-­20
a.	Definition: Life-­threatening, rapidly progressive inflammation (usually
infectious) of the supraglottic region.
(1)	Most often affects children between 1 and 7 years, but may
occur at any age.
(2)	May be caused by infection, thermal injury, caustic ingestion, or
foreign body.
(3)	Most common infectious organisms include Haemophilus
influenzae (unvaccinated), Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A
streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus.
(4)	Patients often present febrile, toxic-­appearing, and tripoding in
respiratory distress. Drooling, dysphagia and inspiratory stridor
are common. Barky cough is absent.

b.	Management: Avoid any agitation of the child prior to securing airway
to prevent impending complete obstruction.
(1)	Allow child to assume a position of comfort. Unobtrusively provide
blow-­by oxygen. Monitor with pulse oximetry.
(2)	To secure airway, emergently consult difficult airway personnel
(pediatric anesthesiologist, intensivist, and/or otolaryngologist).
(a)	If unstable (unresponsive, cyanotic, bradycardic), emergently
intubate.
(b)	If stable with high suspicion, escort patient to OR for laryngoscopy and intubation under general anesthesia. Equipment
for tracheotomy should be readily available.
(c)	If stable with moderate or low suspicion, obtain lateral
neck radiograph to assess for “thumb sign” of an inflamed
epiglottis.
(3)	Initiate broad-­spectrum antibiotic therapy (e.g., vancomycin and
Ceftriaxone).
2.	Croup21-­22
a.	Definition: Common infectious inflammation of the subglottic area.
(1)	Most common in infants aged 6 to 36 months.
(2)	75% of infections are caused by parainfluenza virus.
(3)	Patients present with fever, barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and
increased work of breathing, often worse at night.
b.	Management:
(1)	Administer oxygen to children with hypoxemia or severe respiratory distress. Consider humidified air, although current consensus
suggests it is ineffective for mild to moderate disease.
(2)	If no stridor at rest, give dexamethasone. Consider nebulized
budesonide in patients vomiting or who lack IV access.
(3)	If stridor at rest, give dexamethasone and nebulized racemic epinephrine. Observe for 2 to 4 hours given short duration of action
of nebulized epinephrine.
(4)	Indications for hospitalization include >1 racemic epinephrine
nebulization required, atypical age (<6 months), severe respiratory distress, or dehydration.
(5)	Consider heliox (helium and oxygen mixture) to improve turbulent airflow in moderate to severe croup, although benefit is
controversial.
3.	Foreign body aspiration1,20,23
a.	Definition: Acute airway obstruction from aspiration of an organic
(e.g., nuts, seeds, grapes, hot dogs) or inorganic (e.g., coins, pins,
beads, balloons, small toy parts) foreign body.
(1)	Male children younger than 3 years of age are most susceptible.
(2)	Patients (<40%) present with classic triad of paroxysmal cough,
wheezing, and decreased air entry. Other manifestations include
cyanosis, fever, stridor, and persistent pneumonia or notably may
be asymptomatic.

1

Chapter 1 Emergency and Critical Care Management   19

20  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
(3)	The most common location is the right main bronchus (45% to
57%), then left main bronchus (18% to 40%), and trachea (10%
to 17%).
b.	Management: Care is taken to avoid converting a partial airway
obstruction into complete obstruction.
(1)	If not breathing (no cough or sound):
(a)	Infant: Deliver repeated cycles of 5 back blows followed by 5
chest compressions until object is expelled or victim becomes
unresponsive.
(b)	Child: Perform subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts
(Heimlich maneuver) until object is expelled or victim
becomes unresponsive.
(c)	Patients should be taken to the OR for emergent removal
under direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy.
(2)	If breathing (forcefully coughing, phonating):
(a)	Obtain posteroranterior chest (including neck) radiograph
to screen for radiopaque body or mediastinal shift. Consider
inspiratory and expiratory films (or bilateral lateral decubitus
in young patients) to assess for air trapping. A normal chest
radiograph does not rule out foreign body.
(b)	If clinical concern is high, consider urgent bronchoscopy or
laryngoscopy.
(3)	If patient becomes unresponsive: initiate CPR immediately.
(a)	After 30 chest compressions, open airway and remove foreign
body if visible. Do not perform blind sweep.
(b)	Attempt to give two breaths and continue with cycles of chest
compressions and ventilations until object expelled.
C. Status Asthmaticus24-­28
1.	Definition: Inflammatory airflow obstruction secondary to triad of airway
edema, bronchoconstriction, and hyperresponsiveness.
2.	Examination: Assess breathlessness, speech, alertness, respiratory rate,
accessory muscle use, wheezing, HR, pulsus paradoxus, peak expiratory flow, SpO2, and pCO2.
3.	Management:
a.	Provide oxygen to achieve SpO2 ≥90%. If hypoxemia not readily corrected with supplemental oxygen, consider pneumothorax, pneumonia, methemoglobinemia, or other process.
b.	See Table 1.6 for pharmacologic agents used in acute asthma
exacerbations.
c.	Ventilation interventions:
(1)	Normalizing pCO2 can be a sign of impending respiratory
failure.
(2)	NIPPV (e.g., BiPAP) may be used in patients with impending
respiratory failure to avoid intubation but requires a cooperative
patient with spontaneous respirations.

GI, Gastrointestinal; IM, intramuscular; IV, intravenous; mCg, microgram; MDI, metered-­dose inhaler; SC, subcutaneous.

(3)	Intubation should be approached cautiously given the risk of
worsening air-­trapping and difficulty in managing the transition
from extremely negative to positive pressure ventilation.
(a)	Indications include severe airway obstruction, markedly
increased work of breathing, refractory hypoxemia, and
impending respiratory arrest.
(b)	Ventilation strategies include slower rates with prolonged expiratory phase, minimal end-­expiratory pressures, and short
inspiratory times to minimize hyperinflation and air trapping.
(4)	Consider inhaled anesthetics or ECMO as rescue therapies.
D. Pulmonary Hypertensive Crisis11,29
1.	Definition:
a.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as resting elevated mean
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ≥25 mmHg in children >3 months
of age.

b.	A pulmonary hypertensive crisis is a sudden increase in PAP and
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that causes acute right-­sided
heart failure.
(1)	May be triggered by pain, anxiety, tracheal suctioning, hypoxia,
acidosis, or respiratory illness. Most commonly described after
cardiac surgery or in the setting of rapid withdrawal of PH-­
specific therapies.
(2)	Patients present with systemic hypotension, oxygen desaturation (if atrial or ventricular communication present), and
decreased EtCO2 on capnography (reduced pulmonary blood
flow).
(3)	Assess for increased intensity of systolic murmur (worsening
tricuspid regurgitation) and increased hepatomegaly.
2.	Management: Timely consultation with providers with expertise in managing PH is recommended.
a.	Implement efforts to keep patient calm. Consider opiates, sedatives,
and neuromuscular blockade to reduce stress response, especially
postoperatively. Avoid agents that decrease SVR.
b.	Administer supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia or as an adjunct
to pulmonary vasodilators.
c.	Avoid acute hypercarbia and acidosis, which abruptly increase
PVR. Consider brief hyperventilation or sodium bicarbonate
infusions.
d.	Diuretics treat congestive symptoms. Avoid excessive reduction in
intravascular volume leading to decreased cardiac output.
e.	NIPPV may improve oxygenation, treat hypoventilation, and reduce
work of breathing. Weigh benefits against increasing patient anxiety
and delaying mechanical ventilation.
f.	PH-­specific pharmacologic therapies aim to induce pulmonary vasodilation, support the right ventricle, and maintain cardiac output.
(1)	
Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators: Nitric oxide
(a)	Indicated to reduce need for ECMO in patients with an oxygen index >25.
(b)	Rapid withdrawal of low doses may cause rebound PH.
Gradually decrease dose when weaning.
(c)	Monitor for methemoglobinemia.
(2)	
Phosphodiesterase type-­5 inhibitors: Sildenafil, tadalafil
(a)	Often used to prevent rebound PH associated with cessation
of nitric oxide.
(b)	Monitor for acute hypotension or hypoxemia secondary to
increased alveolar-­arterial gradient.
(3)	
Synthetic prostacyclin analogs: Epoprostenol (Flolan), treprostinil,
iloprost
(4)	
Endothelin receptor antagonist: Bosentan
g.	Consider ECMO or emergent atrial septostomy in case of failed medical management.

E. Hypertensive Crisis11,30
1.	Definition:
a.	For normal BP values based on age and height, see Chapter 7.
b.	Hypertensive emergency: Acutely elevated BP (usually significantly
>99th percentile for age and gender) with evidence of end-­organ
damage.
(1)	Most commonly secondary to renal disease, catecholamine-­
producing tumors, endocrine syndromes, toxidromes, medication
withdrawal, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).
(2)	Presents with encephalopathy (e.g., headaches, vomiting, seizures, altered mental status), vision disturbance, congestive heart
failure (e.g., dyspnea, peripheral edema, gallop rhythm), and
acute kidney injury.
c.	Hypertensive urgency: Acutely elevated BP (usually >5 mmHg greater
than the 99th percentile for age and gender) without evidence of
end-­organ damage.
(1)	Most commonly primary hypertension in children >7 years age,
followed by renal disease.
(2)	Present with minor complaints (e.g., headaches, nausea).
2.	Management:
a.	Rule out increased ICP before instituting antihypertensive treatment
given critical need to maintain cerebral perfusion.
b.	Goal is to reduce BP by ≤25% in the first 8 hours, then gradual
normalization over the next 24 to 48 hours.
c.	See Table 1.7 for hypertensive emergency and urgency medications.
F. Hypercyanotic Crisis (“Tet spell”)20,31
1.	Definition: Cyanotic emergency secondary to an acute worsening of a
preexisting right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (e.g., in a patient
with tetralogy of Fallot) that prevents pulmonary blood flow and induces
a right-­to-­left intracardiac shunt.
a.	Peak incidence occurs between 2 and 4 months of age.
b.	Usually occurs in the morning after crying, feeding, or defecation.
c.	Patients present with extreme cyanosis, hyperpnea, tachypnea, and
agitation.
2.	Management: Follow stepwise approach, escalating if spell is not
broken.
a.	Make every effort to calm the child. Allow parent to comfort. Consider
oral sucrose analgesia (e.g., Sweet-­Ease).
b.	Bring knees to chest in infants or encourage squatting in older children to increase SVR and decrease shunting.
c.	Administer 100% oxygen if patient tolerates, although effect is limited given absence of effective pulmonary blood flow.
d.	For stepwise pharmacologic abortive management, see Table 1.8.
e.	Consider isotonic crystalloid resuscitation (5 to 10 mL/kg boluses) to
ensure adequate preload if patient is dehydrated.

f.	Treat acidosis with sodium bicarbonate.
g.	For refractory spells, consider general anesthesia and emergent surgery for palliation with a systemic to pulmonary shunt or full repair.
G. Altered Level of Consciousness20,32
1.	Definition: A spectrum of impaired consciousness spanning confusion,
disorientation, agitation, stupor, lethargy, and coma.
a.	Fluctuations in level of consciousness are common and progression
may occur rapidly.
b.	Coma: Refers to an unarousable state.
c.	Lethargy: Refers to a depressed consciousness resembling sleep
from which a patient can be aroused but immediately returns to
depressed state.
d.	Stupor: Refers to a state of depressed responses to external stimuli
but not totally asleep.
e.	Standard descriptors of level of responsiveness include:
(1)	The Glasgow Coma Scale (and modified scale for infants): See
Table 1.9 to score level of responsiveness.
(2)	
AVPU mnemonic: Graded as A if alert, V if responsive to verbal
stimulation, P if responsive to painful stimulation, or U if
unresponsive.
f.	Broad differential considerations include Drugs, Infection, Metabolic,
and Structural causes (DIMS).
g.	See Table 1.10 for common etiologies and targeted work-­up
recommendations.
2.	Management: Stabilize initially. Further management is aimed at correcting underlying etiology.
a.	Airway, Breathing, Circulation:
(1)	Administer supplemental oxygen to patients presenting with seizure or with signs of shock, regardless of pulse oximetry reading.
(2)	Intubation is indicated in patients unable to protect their airway.
(3)	Consider delaying administration of atropine unless necessary
secondary to the loss of pupillary light reflex.

(4)	Avoid hypercarbia, maintaining PaCO2 in normal range.
Prophylactic hyperventilation is not recommended.
b.	Dextrose: Correct hypoglycemia immediately with a 5 to 10 mL/kg
bolus of 10% dextrose or 2 to 4 mL/kg of 25% dextrose. After bolus,
start a continuous infusion of dextrose-­containing fluids to avoid
recurrent hypoglycemia.
c.	Imaging: Request emergency head computed tomography (CT)
if patient stable for transport. Consult with neurosurgical team if
indicated.
d.	Hyponatremia: Often asymptomatic unless sodium decreases rapidly
or becomes severe (i.e., <125 mmol/L).
(1)	Treat symptomatic hyponatremia immediately with a 3 to 5 mL/kg
bolus of 3% hypertonic saline over 15 to 30 minutes until seizure
activity ceases or serum sodium level is >125 mmol/L.
(2)	See Chapter 11 for subsequent, slow correction of asymptomatic
hyponatremia.
e.	Infection: If presentation concerning for severe sepsis, treat empirically with broad-­spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone and vancomycin) within the first hour. Include antiviral therapy (e.g., acyclovir)
if viral encephalitis is suspected. Lumbar puncture should be
performed only if there is no clinical suspicion of increased ICP and
the patient is stable.

I. Increased Intracranial Pressure35-­37
1.	Definition: An increase in the volume of an intracranial component
(brain, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid) within the fixed volume of the
skull that exceeds the limits of compensation, generally accepted as a
sustained increase ≥20 mmHg.
a.	Intricately related to cerebral perfusion via the following equation:
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) =
Mean arterial pressure (MAP)−ICP
b.	Most commonly caused by brain trauma, tumors, or intracranial
infections.
c.	Patients present with headache, diplopia, nausea, vomiting, or
decreased level of consciousness.
d.	Assess for signs of trauma, ataxia, pupillary asymmetry, papilledema,
cranial nerve dysfunction, bulging fontanelle, or abnormal posturing.
(1)	Foramen magnum herniation: hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations (Cushing triad)
(2)	Transtentorial herniation: ipsilateral papillary dilation, contralateral
hemiparesis
e.	Evaluation may include infectious studies, electrolytes, toxicology
screen, and stat CT head. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated due
to herniation risk if cause is obstructive.
2.	Management: Adequate CPP (>40 mmHg) is critical to overcome the
resistance of increased ICP.
a.	Stabilize initially as per resuscitation guidelines.
(1)	Maintain normal oxygenation and ventilation to treat increased metabolic demand and avoid hypercarbia-­related cerebral vasodilation.
(2)	Consider hyperventilation (EtCO2 target between 25 and 30) for
patients with active evidence of herniation. Prophylactic hyperventilation is otherwise not recommended.
(3)	Support MAP with adequate isotonic fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agents.
b.	Consultation with neurosurgical team is recommended and required
immediately if evidence of herniation is present.
c.	Administer mannitol (0.25 to 1 g/kg) and/or hypertonic saline (5 to 10
mL/kg of 3% hypertonic saline) in case of acute neurologic deterioration or cerebral herniation.
(1)	Continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline (0.5 to 1.5 mL/kg/h)
may be titrated as necessary to maintain ICP less than 20 mmHg.
(2)	Rapid osmotic diuresis from mannitol may cause hypovolemia
and hypotension, especially in polytrauma patients.
d.	Request noncontrast head CT to evaluate for emergent surgical
pathology.
e.	Treat acute seizure activity given the associated increased cerebral metabolic rate and subsequent increased cerebral blood flow.
Consider prophylactic antiseizure therapy (e.g., phenytoin, levetiracetam), if transport or delayed definitive care is anticipated.

Chapter 1 Emergency and Critical Care Management   31

32  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
f.	Sedation and analgesia prevent increases in ICP related to pain and
agitation, although benefit is balanced with risk of hypotension and
alteration of neurologic exam.
g.	Avoid secondary brain injury by maintaining neuroprotective parameters: Maintain head midline and elevated at 30 degrees, normoglycemia, normonatremia, normothermia, and correct acidosis.
h.	If elevated ICP is refractory to medical management, consider draining
an existing ventriculoperitoneal shunt or acute neurosurgical intervention (external ventricular drain or decompressive craniectomy).
i.	For elevated ICP refractory to medical and surgical management,
consider barbiturate coma.
IV. CRITICAL CARE REFERENCE DATA
1.	Minute ventilation (VE):
VE = Respiratory rate × Tidal volume (VT )

2.	Alveolar gas equation:
PA O2 = [FiO2 (Patm − PH2 O)] − (Pa CO2 /R)

a.	PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
b.	FiO2 = Inspired fraction of oxygen (0.21 at room air)
c.	Patm = Atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level; adjust for high
altitude)
d.	PH2O = Water vapor pressure (47 mmHg)
e.	PaCO2 = Arteriolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide (measured via
arterial blood gas)
f.	R = Respiratory quotient (0.8; CO2 produced/O2 consumed)
3.	Alveolar-­arterial oxygen gradient (A-­a gradient):
A−a gradient = PA O2 − Pa O2

a.	PAO2 = Alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (estimated from alveolar
gas equation)
b.	PaO2 = Arteriolar partial pressure of oxygen (measured via arterial
blood gas)
c.	Normal gradient is 20 to 65 mmHg on 100% oxygen or 5 to 20 mmHg
on room air
d.	The A-­a gradient is increased in hypoventilation, diffusion limitations,
pulmonary blood-­flow shunts and ventilation/blood flow (V/Q) mismatch.
4.	Oxygenation index (OI):
OI = Paw × FiO2 × 100 / Pa O2

a.	Paw (mmHg) = Mean airway pressure
b.	OI >40 in hypoxemic respiratory failure is historically considered an
indication for extracorporeal life support.

I. COMPONENTS OF THE TRAUMA ASSESSMENT
A. Primary Survey
1.	The primary survey includes assessment of ABCDE (airway, breathing,
circulation, disability, exposure/exsanguination). This includes intravenous (IV) access, preferably two large-­bore catheters.
2.	NOTE: The Advanced Trauma Life Support algorithm developed by the
American College of Surgeons continues to support the ABC sequence
in the primary survey. For nontraumatic cardiorespiratory arrest, the
circulation, airway, and breathing (CAB) sequence is currently in use by
the American Heart Association as part of the Pediatric Advanced Life
Support algorithm (see Chapter 1).
B. Secondary Survey (Fig. 2.1)

II. HEAD AND NECK TRAUMA
A. Head Imaging
1.	The PECARN algorithm (Fig. 2.2) is often used to assess risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury.1
2.	If signs of traumatic brain injury on computed tomography (CT), consider consultation by pediatric neurosurgery/trauma surgeon.
B. Cervical Spine and Neck Imaging
1.	There are currently no unified protocols or clinical guidelines for pediatric cervical spine clearance after blunt trauma.
2.	Based on PECARN C-­Spine criteria,2 consider obtaining imaging if any
of the following are present in a patient ≤16 years old:
a.	Altered mental status
b.	Focal neurologic deficits
c.	Complaint of neck pain
d.	Torticollis
e.	Substantial injury to the torso
f.	Predisposing condition
g.	High-­risk motor vehicle crash
h.	Diving accident
3.	Note, many institutions alternatively use NEXUS criteria for clinical c-­
spine clearance. This is validated in children ≥8 years old3 and includes
#1, 2, and 3 of PECARN c-­spine plus presence of intoxication or painful, distracting injury.4,5

≥2 years

<2 years

36  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
4.	Recent guidelines by the Pediatric Cervical Spine Clearance Working
Group Algorithm6 additionally highlight the following factors:
a.	In patients ≤3 years old, consider plain radiographs, if c-­spine cannot be cleared clinically.
b.	Clinical clearance can be done regardless of mechanism of injury if a
child is ≥3 years and is asymptomatic with normal mental status and
normal physical examination.
c.	Clinical clearance CANNOT be performed if the child is observed to
have or reports persistent neck pain, or if there is abnormal head
posture or difficulty in neck movement.
C. Specific Imaging Studies
1.	C-­spine x-­ray (XR) with minimum of two views (lateral, anteroposterior,
and/or odontoid views) (90% sensitivity in identifying bony cervical
spine injury).7
2.	Consider further cross-­section imaging for further evaluation of vertebral
cervical fracture.8
3.	Consider magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for further evaluation
of ligamentous and cord cervical spine injury.9,10
4.	Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA):
Neurologic symptoms persist with no radiographic abnormality. Of note,
recent research found that MRI revealed abnormal features only in
those patients with complete neurologic deficits and may lack sensitivity
with abnormal features associated with partial or temporary neurologic
deficits.11,12
5.	If signs of spinal column or vascular injury on imaging, consider consultation by trauma, spine, and/or neck surgeon.

III. CONCUSSION
A. Concussion Evaluation
1.	The Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) can be used in multiple settings (see Section XI. Resources), including the clinic and emergency
department (ED).13–15
2.	Patients should be referred to a concussion specialist if symptoms
persist greater than 10 to 14 days, if they worsen, or if a patient has a
history of multiple concussions.
B. Return-­to-­school and Return-­to-­play Guidelines (Table 2.1)
1.	Overarching goal is to allow healing from first injury in an attempt to
prevent “second impact syndrome”: Diffuse cerebral swelling in the setting of a second concussion that occurred while still symptomatic from
an earlier concussion. This is a rare but potentially fatal complication of
concussions.
2.	Consider providing the ACE Care Plan for parent and child guidance
(see Section XI. Resources).
3.	Brain rest: Although evidence-­based guidelines for brain rest following
concussion are limited, current research suggests that extreme rest
(i.e., bed rest) can hinder recovery from concussions.16 Other studies

Chapter 2 Traumatic Injuries  37

Return-­to-­Play Guidelines

Return-­to-­School Guidelines

BRIEF GUIDELINES
Each step should last a minimum of 24 hr.
Move to the next level of activity only if no
symptoms are experienced.
If symptoms return, patients should stop activities and notify a health professional.
After evaluation, once the patient has not
had symptoms for minimum 24 hr, patients
should resume play at the previous tolerated
step of the return to play guidelines.

BRIEF GUIDELINES41
If symptoms affect concentration or if unable
to tolerate stimulation for more than 30 min
without symptoms, consider remaining at home
with light mental activities (watching TV, light
reading, and interaction with the family), so
long as they do not provoke symptoms. Minimize
computer use, texting, and video games.
If able to tolerate stimulation for minimum
of 30–45 min without symptoms, consider
returning to learning with modifications.
Providers should provide school notes.

Step 1: No physical activity
Step 2: Low levels of physical activity
Examples: Walking, light jogging, light stationary biking, light weightlifting (lower weight
with higher repetitions, no bench, no squat)
Step 3: Moderate levels of physical activity with
body/head movement
Examples: Moderate jogging, brief running,
moderate-intensity stationary biking,
moderate-­intensity weightlifting (reduced time
and/or reduced weight from typical routine)
Step 4: Heavy noncontact physical activity
Examples: Sprinting/running, high-­intensity
stationary biking, regular weightlifting
routine, noncontact sport-­specific drills (in
three planes of movement)
Step 5: Full contact in controlled practice
Step 6: Full contact in game play

SUGGESTED SCHOOL MODIFICATIONS:
Shortened school days
Frequent breaks during classes
Extra time to complete coursework/assignments
and tests
Decreased homework load
No significant classroom or standardized testing at this time
Consider 504 Plan and/or Individualized Education Plan (IEP)

have found that some degree of cognitive rest can be beneficial and
that patients presenting with signs of injury following concussion (e.g.,
loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia) are more likely to benefit
from rest following concussion than those patients presenting with
symptoms alone (somatic, cognitive, affective, and sleep-­related symptoms).17
4.	For further guidelines, please discuss with concussion specialist.

IV. THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL TRAUMA EVALUATION18
A. Physical Exam
“Seat belt sign” is a significant predictive factor for surgical abdominal
injury after blunt trauma (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 82.4%).19
B. Laboratory Studies to Consider
Type and cross-­match, complete blood cell count (CBC; low hemoglobin
indicates possible hemorrhage; however, this is a late sign), electrolytes,

2

TABLE 2.1
RETURN-­TO-­PLAY AND RETURN-­TO-­SCHOOL15

38  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
liver function tests (high AST/ALT indicate liver injury), lipase (high level
indicates pancreatic injury), and urinalysis (hematuria indicates possible
renal/bladder injury).
C. Imaging Studies to Consider
1.	Chest radiograph
a.	Look for rib fracture, pneumothorax and/or hemothorax, pulmonary
contusion, pneumomediastinum.
b.	Consider chest CT with IV contrast, if recommended by radiologist
and/or trauma surgeon.
2.	Pelvis radiograph
a.	Look for pelvis fracture.
b.	Consider pelvis CT if recommended by radiologist and/or trauma
surgeon.
3.	Abdominal/pelvis CT with IV contrast
a.	This is the “gold standard” for intra-­abdominal injury diagnosis;
however, radiographs should be obtained first if there is concern for
additional injuries that would compromise clinical stability.
b.	For blunt abdominal trauma, routine oral contrast is not indicated, whereas
IV contrast can help to identify visceral, vascular, or bowel injury.20
c.	For penetrating abdominal trauma, triple contrast (oral, rectal, IV) CT
to identify peritoneal penetration or intra-­abdominal organ injury in
stable stab wound victims.21
d.	Look for duodenal hematoma, hemoperitoneum, bladder injury, solid
organ hemorrhage (e.g., spleen and/or liver).
e.	If gross hematuria or urinalysis with greater than 50 RBC/hpf, consider genitourinary tract trauma and consider CT abdomen and pelvis with and without IV contrast (CT urography) and CT cystogram, in
consultation with radiology/urologist/trauma surgeon.
4.	Extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST)
a.	Can help to identify intra-­abdominal free fluid and parenchymal
injury (sensitivity 50%, specificity 85%).22
b.	eFAST with bilateral anterior lung views is highly sensitive for pneumothorax.
c.	Consider performing if qualified personnel available.
5.	If any workup is positive for thoracic or abdominal trauma, immediate
consultation with nearest pediatric trauma center/surgeon is indicated.

V. ORTHOPEDIC/LONG BONE TRAUMA
A. Physical Exam
1.	Look for swelling, ecchymosis, or deformity. Look for breaks in the skin
(abrasions, lacerations) overlying the apex of the fracture suggestive of
open fracture.
2.	Bleeding
a.	Consider arterial bleed if absent pulses and cool extremity with bleeding.
b.	Consider venous bleed if persistent pulse with bleeding.

3.	Compartment syndrome: Tense, swollen area at site of injury, pain,
paresthesia, paresis, pallor, pulselessness (if unable to palpate pulse,
consider using vascular ultrasound with Doppler).
4.	If signs/symptoms of compartment syndrome or open fracture, consultation with a pediatric orthopedic surgeon is recommended.
B. Imaging
1.	Children’s bones are less densely calcified, have thickened periosteum,
and have a growth plate, all of which increase their vulnerability to
fractures.
2.	Obtain radiographs if bony point tenderness or deformity, decreased
sensation, decreased range of motion, or overlying skin discoloration.
3.	Radiographs with anterior-­posterior and lateral views ± oblique and
including areas above and below the suspected area of injury are recommended.
C. Fractures Unique to Children
1.	Physeal or Salter-­Harris fractures18: Fractures involving growth plates
(see Chapter 26).
2.	Plastic fractures: Pliability of bones in response to compressive and
transverse forces.
a.	Torus or buckle fracture: Compression injury with buckled cortex
b.	Greenstick fracture: Fracture on one side of the diaphysis with cortex
intact on other side of diaphysis
c.	Bowing or bending fractures
3.	Avulsion fractures: Tendon or ligament dislodging a bone fragment.
These are more common among adolescents participating in sports.
D. Fractures Requiring Urgent Orthopedic Surgeon Consultation
1.	Open fractures
2.	Unacceptably displaced fractures
3.	Fractures with associated neurovascular compromise (consider emergent reduction to improve neurovascular status if orthopedic surgery is
not available on-­site)
4.	Significant growth plate or joint injuries
5.	Complete or displaced fractures of the long bones of the extremities
6.	Pelvic fractures (other than minor avulsions)
7.	Spinal fractures
8.	Dislocations of major joints other than the shoulder
E. Fractures That Are Appropriate to Manage Acutely With Outpatient
Referral to Orthopedics (Table 2.2)

VI. DENTAL TRAUMA
A. Components of a Tooth (Fig. 2.3)
B. Differences Between Primary and Permanent Teeth (Fig. 2.4)
1.	Primary teeth appear 6 months to 3 years of age, are relatively smaller,
whiter, front teeth have a smooth biting surface.

d.	Most important: Immediate reimplantation should occur within 60
minutes to maximize tooth viability. Without a tooth present, the periodontal ligament can degenerate.
e.	Method:
(1)	Pick up the avulsed tooth by the crown and avoid touching the
root to prevent injury to the periodontal ligament.
(2)	Wash the tooth briefly with saline or Hanks Balanced Salt Solution
(HBSS).
(3)	Administer local lidocaine into the gum if time permitting.
(4)	Insert the root into the alveolar socket with concave part facing
the tongue.
(5)	Ask the patient to bite on gauze to hold it in position.
(6)	
Refer to a dentist emergently for splinting.
f.	Reimplantation should always be attempted. If reimplantation is not
possible, place the tooth in a container in osmolality balanced media
(e.g., HBSS, cold milk) and refer to a dentist emergently for reimplantation and splinting.
2.	Luxation
a.	Luxation injuries result from physical displacement of tooth within
the alveolar socket, tearing of the periodontal ligament with possible
injury to the alveolar bone.24

Dental evaluation 48–72 hr to place a dressing of calcium
hydroxide to prevent injury to the pulp
Immediate dental evaluation within 48 hr

Alveolar Ridge Fracture

Emergent dental evaluation

Enamel-­Dentin Fracture

b.	Primary tooth: If tooth is loose, there is an increased risk of aspiration, and the tooth may be extracted with firm pressure with gauze.
If tooth is not loose, may need repositioning and splinting. In both
situations, refer to a dentist for evaluation within 48 hours.
c.	Permanent tooth: Immediate dental evaluation required if significant
tooth mobility; otherwise, outpatient evaluation within 48 hours is
appropriate.
3.	Subluxation
a.	Subluxation is characterized by tooth injury with minor mobility without displacement.
b.	Regardless of whether permanent or primary tooth, outpatient
dental follow-­up, ideally within 48 hours, is needed to rule out
root fracture.
4.	Tooth fracture:
a.	Classify the fracture per involvement of enamel, dentin, and pulp.25
b.	For management guidelines: Table 2.3.
D. Anticipatory Guidance Following Dental Trauma
1.	Avoid contact sports
2.	Analgesics as needed for pain control (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen,
cold compresses)
3.	Soft diet
4.	Use a soft toothbrush, if able to brush teeth
5.	Regular follow-­up with a dentist

VII. OPHTHALMOLOGIC TRAUMA26
A. Chemical Injury to the Eye18
1.	Determine if substance is an acid or alkali. Alkali solutions tend to be
more damaging because they penetrate more deeply.
2.	Obtain a baseline pH by touching Litmus paper to the conjunctiva.
3.	Retract eye lids as much as possible and irrigate immediately with
normal saline or lactated Ringer solution. This can be performed at the
eyewash station or with a standard bag of fluid with tubing placed at the
medial canthus. Allow the liquid to pass over the open eye to the lateral
canthus.

4.	Continue irrigation for a minimum of 30 minutes with minimum 1 to 2 L
of solution or until pH becomes neutral (7.0 to 7.4). Additional fluid may
be required.
5.	Monitor conjunctival pH with Litmus paper 10 to 20 minutes after
­irrigation.27
6.	Consider ophthalmologic consultation and discuss with Poison Control.
B. Ruptured Globe
1.	A ruptured globe is caused by laceration or puncture of the cornea
and/or sclera following trauma caused by projectile, sharp, or blunt
trauma.
2.	Key physical exam findings include: Teardrop shaped pupil pointing towards perforation, hyphema (hemorrhage in the anterior chamber) and/
or subconjunctival hemorrhage, severe pain, decreased visual acuity,
edema.
3.	Stop the exam and place a rigid eye shield.
4.	Elevate the head of the bed.
5.	Keep patient as calm as possible and control symptoms (e.g., antiemetics and pain control) to avoid increased globe pressure and further
extrusion of vitreous/aqueous humor.
6.	Immediately consult ophthalmology and administer antibiotics.
C. Corneal Abrasion
1.	Key physical exam findings include red eye with tearing, intense pain,
resistance to eye opening, photophobia, foreign body sensation.
2.	Consider application of topical anesthetic before examination. If foreign
body sensation is present on your exam, evert eyelids to look for retained foreign body.
3.	Apply fluorescein staining and examine with Wood lamp. Focal uptake
indicates abrasion.
4.	Consider ophthalmic ointment or artificial tears for lubrication and pain relief.
5.	Consider ophthalmologic consultation in the ED if concern for larger
corneal abrasions involving visual axis, corneal laceration, ulceration,
embedded foreign body, or prolonged healing (i.e., symptoms not
improving after several days).
D. Superglue to the Eye28
1.	Trim eyelashes as needed with blunt-­tip scissors.
2.	Apply copious amounts of ointment, such as bacitracin ophthalmic
ointment or baby shampoo, and gently massage eyelashes to break
down the glue. Advise that the patient continue this as often as possible.
Dissolution of glue may take several days.
3.	Consider consultation with ophthalmology if several days of ointment is
unsuccessful.
E. Eyelid Laceration
1.	Consider consultation with ophthalmology if: Full-­thickness lacerations
(exposed adipose tissue), laceration through the lid margin or tarsal plate,

2

Chapter 2 Traumatic Injuries  43

44  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
lacerations involving lacrimal canaliculi (medial third of the upper/lower
lids), or ptosis (unequal lifting of lids with upward gaze would suggest this).
2.	Some superficial lacerations that occur in the direction of a natural skin
fold may not require repair.
F. Orbital Floor Fractures
1.	This injury is usually caused by blunt trauma and is often referred to as
a “blow out fracture,” because the weakest area of the orbital bones is
the orbital floor/maxillary roof.
2.	Key physical exam findings include: Eyelid swelling, ecchymosis,
enophthalmos of affected eye, ptosis, diplopia, anesthesia of the cheek
(involvement of infraorbital nerve), decreased extraocular eye movements (especially decreased superior range of the globe due to inferior
rectus entrapment).
3.	Evaluate for other eye injuries (e.g., retinal trauma, ruptured globe).
4.	Consider consultation with ophthalmology and plastics/otorhinolaryngology surgeon.
G. Other Instances Requiring Ophthalmologic Consultation
1.	Traumatic iritis is associated with blunt trauma with painful red eye,
pupillary constriction, and photophobia, often with delayed presentation
of symptoms (24 to 72 hours) after trauma.
2.	Sudden loss of vision could suggest retrobulbar hemorrhage or retinal
detachment.

VIII. ANIMAL BITES
A. Wounds at the Highest Risk of Infection
1.	Bites over hand, foot, genitalia, or joint surface
2.	Bites from a cat or human
3.	Wounds in an asplenic or immunocompromised patient
4.	Wounds with delayed presentation to care >12 hours
B. Decision to Suture
1.	Avoid closing wounds at high risk of infection (see earlier) unless for
cosmetic reasons, large wounds or wounds with edges far apart where
loose approximation can be helpful.
2.	Wounds on head and neck can be safely sutured after copious irrigation
and wound débridement if within 6 to 8 hours of injury and there are no
signs of infection. Avoid skin glue due to high risk of infection.
3.	In large wounds, subcutaneous dead space should be closed with a
minimal number of absorbable sutures, with delayed closure in 3 to 5
days, if there is no evidence of infection.
4.	Wounds that involve tendons, joints, deep fascia, or major vasculature
should be evaluated by a surgeon.
C. Antibiotic Prophylaxis29

A. Burns That Should Prompt Consideration of Elective Intubation
1.	Signs of inhalational injury (e.g., singed nasal hairs, soot at the nares,
oropharyngeal erythema)
2.	Early onset ­stridor
3.	Severe burns of face and/or mouth
4.	Progressive respiratory insufficiency
B. Estimation of the Surface Area of Burns
1.	See Fig. 2.5.
2.	Only include partial-­and full-­thickness burns and exclude superficial
burns in the calculation of body surface area.
C. Estimation of the Depth of Burns (Table 2.5)
D. Fluid Resuscitation in Patients With Burns (Fig. 2.6)
1.	Consider central venous access for burns greater than 25% BSA.
2.	Withhold potassium from IV fluids generally for the first 48 hours because of a large release of potassium from damaged tissues.
3.	Foley catheter placement is recommended to monitor urine output during fluid resuscitation phase.
E. Indications for Transfer to a Burn Center30
1.	≥10% partial-­thickness and/or full-­thickness burns
2.	≥5% full-­thickness burns
3.	If burn débridement is warranted (e.g., any partial-­thickness burn >2
cm in diameter)
4.	Respiratory involvement and/or major trauma
5.	Electrical, chemical, or inhalation injury
6.	Burns of critical areas, such as face, hands, feet, perineum, or joints
7.	Circumferential burns

3.	Follow-­up within one week at a pediatric burn center is highly
­recommended.
4.	Oral antibiotics are not indicated.
G. Other Special Considerations With Burns
1.	Circumferential burns can increase risk of compartment syndrome.
2.	Tetanus prophylaxis is warranted with burns. Refer to Chapter 16 for details.
H. Other Types of Burns
1.	Household electrical burn31: In general, household outlets are 120 to
240 V and rarely cause serious injuries or cardiac arrhythmias.
2.	High-­voltage burns (>1000 V), including lightning burns:
a.	Patients are at increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias or asystole.
Consider cardiac monitoring for 48 hours.31
b.	Patients are also at increased risk of compression spine fractures or

spinal cord injury due to tetany, as well as compartment syndrome,
rhabdomyolysis, and hyperkalemia due to muscle swelling.

X. NONACCIDENTAL TRAUMA
A. Physical Abuse
1.	Red flags in history
a.	Delay in presentation
b.	Inconsistent/incomplete/vague/changing explanations for significant injury
c.	History is inconsistent with age, pattern, or severity of the injury
d.	History is inconsistent with child’s physical or developmental
­capabilities
e.	Different witnesses provide different explanation
2.	Concerning physical exam findings32
a.	Bruises: In protected areas (chest, abdomen, back, buttocks), multiple, in various stages of healing, those that do not fit history or developmental stage of child, in unusual places (e.g., postauricular, neck,
inner aspect of arms), those consistent with slap of hand or pinch.
b.	Burns: Multiple, well-­demarcated, stocking/glove distribution, symmetrically burned palms/soles, buttocks and/or lower legs, mirror
image burns of extremities, spared inguinal or other flexural creases,
appearance of a cigarette burn.
c.	Other: Frenulum tears, loop marks from cord or cable, bites.
d.	See Figs. 2.7–2.10 (color plates) and Figs. EC 2.A-D for examples.
3.	Imaging guidelines
a.	Skeletal survey33–35
(1)	In children less than 2 years of age, use skeletal survey to evaluate for bony injury. This includes frontal and lateral views of the
skull, lateral views of the cervical spine and thoracolumbosacral
spine, and single frontal views of the long bones, hands, feet,
chest, and abdomen.

(2)	In children greater than 5 years of age, targeted imaging to the
area(s) of suspected injury is usually appropriate. The utility of
screening with skeletal survey diminishes after 5 years of age.
(3)	In children 2 to 5 years of age, decisions about type of imaging
are open to clinical judgement.
(4)	Do not use “babygrams” (i.e., whole-­body x-­rays in one image)
because of the high rate of false-­negatives.
(5)	Follow-­up skeletal survey approximately 2 weeks after the initial
examination should be performed when abnormal or equivocal
findings are found on initial study and when abuse is suspected
on clinical grounds to identify fractures missed on initial survey.
(6)	Fractures with an association with child abuse include rib
fractures, metaphyseal bucket and corner fractures, spine and
scapula fractures, and complex skull fractures (Fig. 2.11 and
Figs. EC 2.E-G for examples).
b.	Head CT without contrast if:
(1)	Less than 6 months of age with suspected abuse
(2)	Neurologic changes
(3)	Facial injuries concerning for abuse
c.	Additional imaging/consultation
(1)	Ophthalmologic evaluation for retinal hemorrhages.
(2)	MRI may identify lesions not detected by CT (e.g., posterior fossa
injury and diffuse axonal injury).
4.	What to do if physical abuse is suspected
a.	All healthcare providers are required by law to report suspected child
maltreatment to the local police and/or child welfare agency.
b.	In addition, consider consultation with local child injury/abuse specialist.
c.	Medical stabilization is the primary goal; prevention of further injuries
is the long-­term goal.
d.	The professional who makes such reports is immune from any civil
or criminal liability.
e.	Carefully and legibly document the following:
(1)	Reported and suspected history and mechanisms of injury.
(2)	Any history given by the victim in his or her own words (use
quotation marks).
(3)	Information provided by other providers or services.
(4)	Physical examination findings, including drawings of injuries and
details of dimensions, color, shape, and texture. Consider early use
of police crime laboratory photography to document injuries. If taking photos, start with full patient, then part of patient, then zoomed
into wound, and then take a separate photo of wrist identification
band.

B. Sexual Abuse
1.	Physical Exam Findings
a.	Normal genital examination does not rule out abuse; most examinations are normal in cases of abuse.36
b.	Table 2.6 for physical exam findings highly suggestive of sexual abuse.37
2.	What to do if sexual abuse is suspected38
a.	If suspected sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours to a child
younger than 12 years or within 120 hours to a child older than 12
years, defer interview and examination and urgently involve a multidisciplinary team with a sexual assault nurse examiner with expertise
in the evaluation of sexual abuse.
b.	Nonacute examinations falling outside of the above time windows
should be deferred to a child advocacy center.
c.	Genital examination should be performed by a trained forensic
­specialist.
d.	Evaluate the need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.
3.	STI testing
a.	Tests include: Serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), serum
syphilis, gonorrhea (culture or NAAT from pharynx and anus in boys
and girls, vagina in girls and urethra in boys), chlamydia (culture or
NAAT from anus in boys and girls, vagina in girls).
b.	In adolescents, recommended for all patients.
c.	In prepubertal children, consider testing if:
(1)	Experienced penetration of the vagina or anus
(2)	Abuse by a stranger

Toxicology

Whenever ingestion is suspected, contact local poison control at
1-­800-­222-­1222.
Each year the American Association of Poison Control Centers records
more than 1.2 million childhood poisoning exposures. Of these exposures,
76% occur in children younger than the age of 6 years. Exposures in young
children are often unintentional, whereas adolescents are more likely to
have intentional ingestions.1

I. INITIAL EVALUATION
A. History
1.	Exposure history
Obtain history from witnesses and/or close contacts. Route, timing, and
number of exposures (acute, chronic, or repeated ingestion), prior treatments or decontamination efforts.2,3
2.	Substance identification and quantity ingested
Attempt to identify exact name of substance(s) ingested, including: product
name, active ingredients, possible contaminants, expiration date, concentration, and dose. Attempt to estimate the missing volume of liquid or the number
of missing pills from a container. Poison control can assist with pill identification.
3. Environmental information
Accessible items in the house or garage; open containers; spilled tablets;
household members taking medications, visitors to the house, herbs, or
other complementary medicines.2
B. Workup and Laboratory Investigation
1.	Electrocardiogram (ECG): Several medications will cause ECG changes,
including QRS prolongation.
2.	Blood Tests
a.	Individual drug levels such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and ethanol
are helpful general screenings in an acute, unknown ingestion.
b.	Acetaminophen levels are especially important to test in suicidal
ingestions. Acetaminophen is detected in 1/500 of all suicidal
ingestions even when it is not reported as an ingested agent.3
c.	Venous blood gas, blood glucose, and serum electrolytes.
3.	Urine Toxicology Screens
a.	Basic screens include amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
52

Chapter 3 Toxicology  53
b.	Positive results are presumptive only; must be confirmed by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry.4
C. Clinical Diagnostic Aids (Table EC 3.A)

III. INGESTIONS AND ANTIDOTES
See Table 3.2.
A. Decontamination
1.	Activated charcoal5
a.	Most effective when used within first hour after ingestion but can be
given after first hour, especially for sustained-­release preparations.
Should be given PO to an awake and alert patient. Nasogastric (NG)
tube should be used only if a patient is intubated.
b.	Substances not absorbed by charcoal: Iron, alcohols, lithium
c.	Contraindications: Unprotected airway, caustic ingestion, disrupted
gastrointestinal tract, concern for aspiration
2.	Whole bowel irrigation
a.	Indicated for evacuation of substances not bound to activated
charcoal such as iron, lead-­containing foreign bodies, fatal sustained
release products, drug packing.
b.	Use a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution preparation to irrigate the bowel. Recommended rates: 9 months to 6 years (500
mL/hr), 6 to 12 years (1000 mL/hr), more than 12 years (1500 to
2000 mL/hr).
B. Enhanced Removal
1.	Hemodialysis or exchange transfusions may be indicated to remove a
drug/toxin.
2.	Ingestions that may require enhanced removal therapies: Salicylate,
lithium, methanol, ethylene glycol, metformin-­associated lactic acidosis,
valproate, theophylline
C. Other Considerations
1.	Many ingestions managed primarily with supportive care of any associated toxic effects, such as hypotension or hyperpyrexia.
2.	Seizures: First line agents are benzodiazepines. Barbiturates or propofol
should be considered as second line agents. Phenytoin has no role in
the treatment of toxin-­induced seizures.6
3.	Patients with severe poisoning and refractory cardiorespiratory failure
after ingestion are potential extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) candidates because the toxic effects are transient.

NAPQI metabolite is hepatotoxic.
A. Four Phases of Intoxication
1.	Phase 1 (first 24 hours): Nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, malaise, vomiting.
2.	Phase 2 (24 to 72 hours): Above symptoms resolve; right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, and increasing transaminases develop.
3.	Phase 3 (72 to 96 hours): Return of nonspecific symptoms as well as
evidence of liver failure (increased prothrombin time, lactate, phosphate), renal failure, and encephalopathy.
4.	Phase 4 (4 days to 2 weeks): Recovery or death.
B. Treatment Criteria
1.	Serum acetaminophen concentration above the possible toxicity line
on the Rumack-­Matthew nomogram after single acute ingestion
(Fig. 3.1).
2.	History of ingesting more than 200 mg/kg or 10 g (whichever is less) and
serum concentration not available or time of ingestion not known.
3.	If time of ingestion is unknown or multiple/chronic ingestion, check
acetaminophen level and AST. Treat if either is elevated.
C. Antidote: N-­Acetylcysteine (See Formulary)
1.	PO: 140 mg/kg loading dose followed by 70 mg/kg Q4 hours for 17
doses (18 total doses including loading dose).
2.	Intravenous (IV): 150 mg/kg N-­acetylcysteine IV loading dose over 60
minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, followed by 100 mg/kg
over 16 hours for a total infusion time of 21 hours. Some patients may
require more than 21 hours of N-­acetylcysteine administration.
3.	Liver failure: Continue the 100 mg/kg over 16 hours infusion until
resolution of encephalopathy, AST less than 1000 units/L, and INR
less than 2.

V. LEAD POISONING8
A. Definition:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a reference level
of 5 mCg/dL to identify children with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs).
B. Sources of Exposure:
Paint, dust, soil, drinking water, cosmetics, cookware, toys, and caregivers with occupations and/or hobbies using lead-­containing materials or
substances.
C. Overview of Symptoms by Blood Lead Level:
1.	BLL ≥40 mCg/dL: Irritability, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation,
anorexia
2.	BLL ≥70 mCg/dL: Lethargy, seizure, and coma. Note: Children may be
asymptomatic with lead levels greater than 100 mCg/dL.

Procedures
Andrew Percy, MD
See additional content on Expert Consult

I. GENERAL GUIDELINES
A. Consent
Before performing any procedure, it is crucial to obtain informed consent
from the parent or guardian by explaining the procedure, the indications,
any risks involved, and any alternatives. Obtaining consent should not
impede life-­saving, emergency procedures.
B. Risks
1.	All invasive procedures involve pain, risk for infection and bleeding, and
potential injury to neighboring structures.
2.	Sedation and analgesia should be planned in advance, and the risks
of such explained to the parent and/or patient as appropriate. (See
Chapter 6 and the AAP Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of
Pediatric Patients Before, During, and After Sedation for Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures.1)
3.	Universal precautions and proper sterile technique should be followed
for all patient contact that exposes the healthcare provider to bodily
fluids.
C. Documentation
It is important that the physician performing the procedure document the
informed consent process. Include the date, time, additional personnel
present (if applicable), brief summary of the consent conversation, the
diagnosis, recommended procedure, specific risks and benefits, and alternative treatments. It is equally important to document if a patient refuses a
procedure and that the risks associated with refusal were discussed.
D. Attending to the Needs of a Fearful Child
Children represent a vulnerable population in that they often lack the
capacity to understand why a potentially uncomfortable procedure is being
performed. All efforts should be made to provide information about the procedure to the child at an age-­appropriate level. Utilize Child Life Specialists
as able. When possible, allow the child to touch unfamiliar objects in the
examination room to desensitize them and enhance trust. Address the
child’s fears. Toddlers often fear separation from the parent. Older children
often fear pain. Adolescents often worry about embarrassment sustained
by expressing anxiety or fear. Encourage active parent participation and
presence. Allow all children a degree of basic autonomy such as selecting
the postprocedure bandage color.

II. ULTRASOUND FOR PROCEDURES
A. Introduction to Ultrasound
Ultrasound has become an increasingly important bedside diagnostic and
procedural aid, and it can improve visualization of subcutaneous structures
during procedures.
B. Ultrasound Basics
1.	Probe Selection
a.	Linear transducers use higher frequencies to produce higher resolution images and are primarily used for procedures in pediatrics. A
wide area of contact at the skin surface facilitates needle placement
in procedures.
b.	Curvilinear transducers use low to midrange frequencies and permit
deep structure visualization. Though they provide a wide area of skin
contact to facilitate procedures near concave and convex surfaces,
larger curvilinear probes are difficult to use in small children.
c.	There are a variety of other probes (phased-­array, microconvex)
that generate sector shaped images but are predominantly used for
diagnostic purposes.
2.	Image Optimization
a.	Ensure adequate contact by using enough ultrasound gel and applying comfortable pressure on the skin.
b.	Gain: Measure of image brightness which is used for optimizing
images and reducing artifact.
c.	Frequency: Increase to improve image resolution of shallow structures. Decrease to improve imaging of deep structures.
d.	Depth: Adjust to visualize structure of interest and at least a centimeter of tissue below that structure.

III. NEUROLOGIC PROCEDURES: LUMBAR PUNCTURE2,3
A. Indications:
Examination of spinal fluid for suspected infection, inflammatory disorder,
or malignancy, instillation of intrathecal chemotherapy, or measurement of
opening pressure.
B. Complications:
Local pain, infection, bleeding, spinal fluid leak, hematoma, spinal headache, and acquired epidermal spinal cord tumor (caused by implantation
of epidermal material into the spinal canal if no stylet is used on skin entry).
C. Cautions and Contraindications:
1.	Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): Before lumbar puncture (LP),
perform a funduscopic examination. Presence of papilledema, retinal
hemorrhage, or clinical suspicion of increased ICP should prompt further evaluation and may be a contraindication to the procedure. A sudden drop in spinal canal fluid pressure by rapid release of cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) may cause fatal herniation. Computed tomography (CT)

may be indicated before LP if there is suspected intracranial bleeding,
focal mass lesion, or increased ICP. A normal CT scan does not rule out
increased ICP but usually excludes conditions that may put the patient
at risk for herniation. Decision to obtain CT should not delay appropriate
antibiotic therapy, if indicated.
2.	Bleeding diathesis: Platelet count greater than 50,000/mm3 is desirable before LP, and correction of any clotting factor deficiencies can
minimize the risk for bleeding and subsequent cord or nerve root
compression.
3.	Overlying skin infection may result in inoculation of CSF with organisms.
4.	LP should be deferred in unstable patients, and appropriate therapy
should be initiated, including antibiotics, if indicated.
D. Procedure:
1.	Apply local anesthetic cream if sufficient time is available.
2.	Position child (Fig. 4.1) in either the sitting position or lateral recumbent
position, with hips, knees, and neck flexed. Keep shoulders and hips
aligned to avoid rotating the spine. Do not compromise a small infant’s
cardiorespiratory status with positioning.
3.	Locate the desired intervertebral space (either L3 to L4 or L4 to L5)
by drawing an imaginary line between the top of the iliac crests.
Alternatively, ultrasound can be used to mark the intervertebral space
(see Section XI, Online Content).
4.	Prepare the skin in a sterile fashion. Drape conservatively to make monitoring the infant possible. Use a 20-­to 22-­G spinal needle with stylet
(1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 inch depending on the size of the child). A smaller-­
gauge needle will decrease the incidence of spinal headache and CSF
leak.
5.	Overlying skin and interspinous tissue can be anesthetized with 1%
lidocaine using a 25G needle.
6.	Puncture the skin in the midline just caudad to the palpated spinous
process, angling slightly cephalad toward the umbilicus. Advance
several millimeters at a time, and withdraw stylet frequently to check for
CSF flow. Needle may be advanced without the stylet once it is completely through the skin. In small infants, one may not feel a change in
resistance or “pop” as the dura is penetrated.
7.	If resistance is met initially and the needle cannot be advanced, withdraw needle to just under the skin surface and redirect the angle of the
needle slightly.
8.	Send CSF for appropriate studies. In general, send the first tube for
culture and Gram stain, the second tube for measurement of glucose
and protein levels, and the last tube for cell count and differential.
Additional tubes can be collected for viral cultures, polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), or CSF metabolic studies, if indicated. If subarachnoid
hemorrhage or traumatic tap is suspected, send the first and fourth
tubes for cell count, and ask the laboratory to examine the CSF for
xanthochromia.

9.	Accurate measurement of CSF pressure can be made only with the
patient lying quietly on his or her side in an unflexed position. It is not a
reliable measurement in the sitting position. Once the free flow of spinal
fluid is obtained, attach the manometer and measure CSF pressure.
Opening pressure is recorded when the CSF level is steady.

IV. OTOLARYNGOLOGIC PROCEDURES
A. Cerumen Impaction Removal4,5
1.	Indications: Symptomatic (decreased hearing, pain) and/or assessment of the ear. Clinicians should not routinely disimpact asymptomatic
patients whose ears can be adequately assessed.
2.	Complications: Allergic reaction to cerumenolytics, trauma, earache, dizziness, nystagmus, retention of water, tympanic membrane perforation.
3.	Procedures:
a.	Cerumenolytics
(1)	There is no high-­quality evidence suggesting that one cerumenolytic is more effective than another. Water and saline are equally
as effective as cerumenolytics. There is no difference in efficacy
between oil-­based and water-­based treatments.
(2)	Avoid hydrogen peroxide; may exacerbate cerumen impaction.
(3)	Apply 5 to 10 eardrops twice daily for no longer than 4 days. Keep
the head tilted for several minutes for cerumenolytic retention.
b.	Irrigation
(1)	Direct visualization is not necessary.
(2)	Irrigation of the ear canal with a large syringe containing lukewarm water is equally effective as a commercial mechanical jet
irrigator.5
(3)	Place a small bucket (e.g., emesis bin) under the patient’s ear to
collect water.
(4)	Straighten the ear as much as possible by lifting the auricle up
and posteriorly. Gently apply a continuous stream upwards in the
canal.
(5)	
Note that irrigation is contraindicated in patients with tympanostomy tubes or perforated tympanic membranes, and for removing vegetables/legumes (increases swelling) and button batteries
(enhances current flow).
c.	Manual Removal/Instrumentation
(1)	Most useful for cerumen removal in the outer one-­third of the ear.
(2)	Direct visualization is essential, and may render manual removal
impossible in an uncooperative patient.
(3)	Tools include curettes (plastic or metal), spoons, alligator
forceps. Do not attempt to break through the cerumen. Advance
the loop of the curette behind the cerumen and retrieve.
d.	A video on cerumen removal is available on the New England Journal
of Medicine’s website.
B. Foreign Body Removal from Ear6
1.	Indications: Retained foreign body in the external auditory canal.

66  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
2.	Contraindications: Urgent referral to an otolaryngologist prior to
attempted removal is indicated if object is a button battery or penetrating the ear canal (e.g., pencil, cotton-­tipped swab).
3.	Complications: External auditory canal trauma (most common), perforation of the tympanic membrane, retained foreign object.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Insects should be killed with mineral oil, ethanol, or lidocaine prior to
attempted removal.
b.	Irrigation is useful for hard objects resistant to grasping that are
nonocclusive.
c.	Instrumentation is most successful for irregularly shaped objects that
are graspable.
d.	Refer to otolaryngology if removal is unsuccessful.
5.	A video on removal of foreign bodies from the ear and nose is available
on the New England Journal of Medicine’s website.
C. Foreign Body Removal from Nose6,7
1.	Indications: Retained foreign body in the nasal cavity. Button batteries
and magnets attached to the nasal septum require urgent removal.
2.	Contraindications: Most nasal foreign bodies do not require subspecialty
referral. Consider otolaryngology referral for posterior objects, button
batteries, and unsuccessful initial attempts.
3.	Complications: Epistaxis, perforation of cribriform plate, retained foreign
object.
4.	Procedure: Lidocaine or any vasoconstrictor (e.g., crushed ice) may be
used to minimize bleeding and edema.
a.	Self-­Removal: The easiest and least invasive method. Typically,
only effective for patients older than 3 years. Instruct the patient to
occlude the unobstructed nostril and blow his/her nose.
b.	Parent Kiss: Provides up to a 60% successful removal rate.
(1)	Instruct the caregiver to place his/her lips around the patient’s
lips (similar to a “mouth-­to-­mouth” resuscitation breath) and
occlude the uninvolved nostril with one finger.
(2)	Quickly and forcefully exhale one puff into the child’s mouth.
This maneuver often expels the foreign body.
c.	High-­Flow Oxygen: Best for foreign bodies that completely occlude
the anterior nasal cavity. Place suction tubing into the unobstructed
nostril while the child’s mouth is closed. Deliver 10 to 15 L/min of
oxygen flow through the tubing.
d.	Instrumentation: Best for foreign bodies that are nonocclusive.
(1)	Equipment: alligator forceps, right-­angle hook, Foley catheter (5
to 8 Fr), irrigating devices
(2)	Use alligator forceps to extract compressible objects that have
rough surfaces.
(3)	Use a right-­angle hook for smooth objects that cannot be easily
grasped.

(4)	Use a Foley catheter for small round objects (e.g., marble).
Lubricate the catheter, advance the uninflated catheter past the
object, inflate the catheter balloon, and withdraw the catheter
and the object.
D. Management of Epistaxis6,8
1.	Indications: Simple nosebleed. Most cases of epistaxis in children have
a benign etiology. Referral to an otolaryngologist is only indicated for
uncontrollable bleeding, posterior epistaxis, hemodynamic instability,
or anatomic abnormalities (e.g., tumors, polyps). See Chapter 14 for
management of epistaxis in patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand
disease, immune thrombocytopenia, or other bleeding disorders.
2.	Complications: Persistent bleeding, swallowing blood, toxic shock
syndrome (from packing material), septal hematomas/abscesses from
traumatic packing.
3.	Procedure: The child should sit upright and bent forward at the waist to
minimize swallowing blood.
a.	Direct compression: Instruct the child or parent to compress the
nasal alae together for a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes. Most simple
bleeds will clot after 5 to 10 minutes.
b.	Topical vasoconstriction: Use oxymetazoline-­soaked cotton pledgets
or gauze. Phenylephrine is associated with morbidity when used topically and should be avoided in patients younger than 6 years of age.
However, if bleeding is refractory to other interventions, the minimum
dose of phenylephrine needed to cease bleeding should be used.
Use a squirt bottle or apply the vasoconstrictor on a piece of cotton,
applying direct pressure on the nose for 5 to 10 minutes.
c.	Nasal packing
(1)	Apply topical anesthetic (4% lidocaine or tetracaine) on a cotton
pledget and insert into the nasal cavity.
(2)	Rub antibiotic ointment into a quarter-­inch × 72-­inch gauze
ribbon. Using a nasal speculum or forceps, pack the nasal
cavity by grasping the gauze ribbon approximately 6 inches
from its end and placing the packing as far back as possible.
Ensure that the free end protrudes from the nose and secure
with tape.
(3)	Maintain packing for 72 hours and prescribe antistaphylococcal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days to minimize risk of toxic shock
syndrome. If bleeding persists after 72 hours, packing should be
replaced and the child referred to an otolaryngologist.

V. CARDIOVASCULAR PROCEDURES
A. Vagal Maneuvers for Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)9,10,11
1.	Indications: Supraventricular tachycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular (AV)
block, evaluation of cardiac murmurs.

Chapter 4 Procedures  67

68  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
2.	Contraindications: Carotid sinus massage is to be avoided in patients
with prior stroke within the past 3 months or any history of ventricular
arrhythmia.
3.	Complications: Typically transient (resolve within seconds to minutes)
and include prolonged sinus pause, hypertension (increased intrathoracic pressure), hypotension (decreased venous return/decrease in
intrathoracic pressure on exhalation).
4.	Procedure:
a.	Cold stimulus to the face: Briefly place an icepack or washcloth
soaked in ice water on the forehead or bridge of the nose. The ice
should not be applied for longer than 30 seconds to avoid frostbite.
b.	Valsalva maneuver: Place the patient in supine position and instruct
to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis. The strain should be
maintained for 10 to 15 seconds before resuming normal breathing.
c.	Modified Valsalva maneuver: Greater success rate at restoring
sinus rhythm than standard Valsalva. Place the patient in a semi-­
recumbent position (45-­degree angle), and apply standard Valsalva
strain. Immediately reposition supine with 15 seconds of passive leg
raise at a 45-­degree angle.
d.	Carotid sinus massage: Place the patient in a supine position with
neck extension. Apply steady pressure for 5 to 10 seconds to one
carotid sinus (inferior to the angle of the mandible where pulsation
is detected). If unsuccessful, wait 1 to 2 minutes and repeat on the
contralateral side.
B. Heelstick and Fingerstick12
1.	Indications: Blood sampling in infants, obtaining point of care whole
blood samples such as serum glucose
2.	Complications: Infection, bleeding, osteomyelitis.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Warm heel or finger.
b.	Clean with alcohol.
c.	Using a lancet puncture heel on the lateral aspect, avoiding the
posterior area, or finger on the distal palmar lateral pad.
d.	Wipe away the first drop of blood, and then collect the sample using
a capillary tube or container.
e.	Alternate between squeezing blood from the leg toward the heel (or
from the hand toward the finger) and then releasing the pressure for
several seconds.
C. Peripheral Intravenous Access
1.	Indications: Blood sampling and access to peripheral venous circulation
to deliver fluid, medications, or blood products.
2.	Complications: Thrombosis, infection.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Apply tourniquet around the extremity proximal to chosen site.
b.	Prepare site with alcohol or chlorhexidine.

c.	Insert IV catheter, bevel up, at an angle almost parallel to the skin,
advancing until a flash of blood is seen in the catheter hub. Advance
the plastic catheter only, remove the needle, and secure the catheter.
d.	After removing tourniquet, attach a syringe and apply gentle negative
pressure to withdraw blood for serum sampling. Then, attach T connector filled with saline to the catheter, flush with normal saline (NS)
to ensure patency of the IV line.
4.	Ultrasound-­Guided Procedure:
a.	With linear ultrasound probe, identify a vein that does not appear
to be prohibitively tortuous or stenotic. Perform this by sliding the
probe along the course of the vessel and identifying its direction and
branching. The saphenous veins in the calves, veins in the forearms,
antecubital areas, inside of the upper arms, and external jugular
veins are areas where ultrasound guidance can help. An ideal vessel
appears less than 1 cm below the skin surface. Deeper vessels are
prone to through-­and-­through perforation of the vessel. Infiltration
around deeper vessels is also a risk, as a shorter length of catheter
resides in the vessel after insertion.
b.	Prepare the site, and in the case of limb vessels, place a tourniquet
proximal to the insertion site.
c.	Under ultrasound visualization, insert the needle into the skin at a
shallow (usually <30 degrees) angle to the skin at the midline of the
probe near where it contacts the skin. With the probe visualizing the
vessel transversely, slowly advance the needle and follow the tip of
the needle by sliding the probe away from you. Advance the ultrasound probe until the needle punctures the vessel wall.
d.	Proceed with cannulation of the vessel and secure the intravenous
catheter per standard procedure.
5.	Infiltration and Extravasation13: Common injury secondary to fluid infusion into subcutaneous tissues around the venipuncture site. Typically
occurs due to puncture of the vein or if the catheter slips out of the vein.
The difference between infiltration and extravasation is the type of fluid
that has leaked (nonvesicant vs. vesicant). Infiltrations are generally
benign, although they can still inflict damage via exertion of mechanical forces on surrounding structures. Extravasation due to a vesicant
can cause blistering and burns, leading to necrosis of the tissue. To
determine if infiltration/extravasation has occurred, firmly occlude the
vein 1 to 2 inches proximal to the insertion site. Continued infusion without resistance indicates infiltration. Immediately stop the infusion. Refer
to institutional policy for guidelines regarding application of medication
(e.g., hyaluronidase, phentolamine, nitroglycerin ointment). Elevate the
affected limb to reduce swelling; apply a warm compress for 10 to 15
minutes; encourage movement of the affected arm. Reevaluate the site
every 8 hours.

D. External Jugular Puncture and Catheterization (see Section XI,
Online Content)
E. Radial Artery Puncture and Catheterization2,3
1.	Indications: Arterial blood sampling or frequent blood gas and continuous blood pressure monitoring in an intensive care setting.
2.	Complications: Infection, bleeding, occlusion of artery by hematoma or
thrombosis, ischemia if ulnar circulation is inadequate.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Before the procedure, test adequacy of ulnar blood flow with the
Allen test: Clench the hand while simultaneously compressing ulnar
and radial arteries. The hand will blanch. Release pressure from the
ulnar artery, and observe the flushing response. Procedure is safe to
perform if the entire hand flushes.
b.	Locate the radial pulse. It is optional to infiltrate the area over the
point of maximal impulse with lidocaine. Avoid infusion into the vessel by aspirating before infusing. Prepare the site in a sterile fashion.
c.	Puncture: Insert a butterfly needle attached to a syringe at a 30-­to
60-­degree angle over the point of maximal impulse. Blood should
flow freely into the syringe in a pulsatile fashion. Suction may be
required for plastic tubes. Once the sample is obtained, apply firm,
constant pressure for 5 minutes and then place a pressure dressing
on the puncture site.
d.	Catheter placement: Secure the patient’s hand to an arm board.
Leave the fingers exposed to observe any color changes. Prepare the
wrist with sterile technique and infiltrate over the point of maximal
impulse with 1% lidocaine. Insert an IV catheter with its needle at a
30-­degree angle to the horizontal until a flash of blood is seen in the
catheter hub. Advance the plastic catheter and remove the needle.
Alternatively, pass the needle and catheter through the artery to transfix it, and then withdraw the needle. Very slowly, withdraw the catheter
until free flow of blood is noted, then advance the catheter and secure
in place using sutures or tape. Seldinger technique (Fig. 4.2) using a
guidewire can also be used. Apply a sterile dressing and infuse heparinized isotonic fluid (per institutional protocol) at a minimum of 1 mL/
hr. A pressure transducer may be attached to monitor blood pressure.
e.	Suggested size of arterial catheters based on weight:
(1)	Infant (<10 kg): 24 G or 2.5 Fr, 2.5 cm
(2)	Child (10 to 40 kg): 22 G or 2.4 Fr, 2.5 cm
(3)	Adolescent (>40 kg): 20 G
4.	Ultrasound-­Guided Procedure
a.	Use the linear probe. After the sterile field has been prepped, apply
gel to the probe and place within a sterile cover. Place the ultrasound probe transverse to the artery on the radial, posterior tibial, or

dorsalis pedis pulse. Identify the artery, which will appear pulsatile
with some compression. Once the artery has been identified, center
the probe over the vessel (Fig. 4.3). Insert the needle into the skin at
a 45-­degree angle at the midline of the probe near where it contacts
the skin. With the probe visualizing the vessel transversely, slowly

advance the needle and follow the tip of the needle by sliding the
probe away. Advance the ultrasound probe until the needle punctures the vessel wall. Proceed with the rest of the procedure after
vessel puncture, as described previously.
5.	Videos on arterial puncture and radial artery catheterization are available
on the New England Journal of Medicine’s website.
6.	A video on ultrasound-­guided radial artery catheterization is available on
the New England Journal of Medicine’s website.
F. Posterior Tibial and Dorsalis Pedis Artery Puncture
1.	Indications: Arterial blood sampling when radial artery puncture is
unsuccessful or inaccessible.
2.	Complications: Infection, bleeding, ischemia if circulation is inadequate.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Posterior tibial artery: Puncture the artery posterior to medial malleolus while holding the foot in dorsiflexion.
b.	Dorsalis pedis artery: Puncture the artery at dorsal midfoot between
first and second toes while holding the foot in plantar flexion.
G. Intraosseous (IO) Access2,3 (Fig. 4.4)
1.	Indications: Obtain emergency access in children during life-­threatening
situations. This is very useful during cardiopulmonary arrest, shock,
burns, and life-­threatening status epilepticus. Any crystalloid, blood
product, or drug that may be infused into a peripheral vein may also
be infused into the IO space. The IO needle should be removed once
adequate vascular access has been established. Insertion of IO needle
into fractured bones should be avoided.
2.	Complications:
a.	Complications are rare, particularly with the correct technique.
Frequency of complications increases with prolonged infusions.

FIGURE 4.4
Intraosseous needle placement using standard anterior tibial approach. Insertion point
is in the midline on medial flat surface of anterior tibia, 1 to 3 cm (2 fingerbreadths)
below tibial tuberosity. (From Dieckmann R, Fiser D, Selbst S. Pediatric Emergency and
Critical Care Procedures. St. Louis: Mosby; 1997.)

b.	Complications include extravasation of fluid from incomplete or
through and through cortex penetration, infection, bleeding, osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome, fat embolism, fracture, epiphyseal
injury.
3.	Sites of entry (in order of preference):
a.	Anteromedial surface of the proximal tibia, 2 cm below and 1 to 2
cm medial to the tibial tuberosity on the flat part of the bone.
b.	Distal femur 3 cm above the lateral condyle in the midline.
c.	Medial surface of the distal tibia 1 to 2 cm above the medial malleolus (may be a more effective site in older children).
d.	Proximal humerus, 2 cm below the acromion process into the greater
tubercle with the arm held in adduction and internal rotation.
e.	Anterosuperior iliac spine at a 90-­degree angle to the long axis of the
body.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Prepare the selected site in a sterile fashion.
b.	If the child is conscious, anesthetize the puncture site down to the
periosteum with 1% lidocaine (optional in emergency situations).
c.	Choose between a manual IO or drill-­powered IO insertion device:
(1)	For manual IO needle: Insert a 15-­to 18-­gauge IO needle perpendicular to the skin at an angle away from the epiphyseal plate,
and advance to the periosteum. With a boring rotary motion, penetrate through the cortex until there is a decrease in resistance,
indicating that you have reached the marrow. The needle should
stand firmly without support. Secure the needle carefully.
(2)	For drill-­powered IO needle: Enter skin with the needle perpendicular to the skin, as with the manual needle, and press the
needle until you meet the periosteum. Then apply easy pressure

4

Medial flat surface of
the anterior tibia

74  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
while gently depressing the drill trigger until you feel a decrease
in resistance. Remove the drill while holding the needle steady
to ensure stability prior to securing the needle. Use an EZ-­IO AD
for patients greater than 40 kg, and use EZ-­IO PD for patients
greater than 6 kg and less than 40 kg.
d.	Remove the stylet and attempt to aspirate marrow. (Note that it is
not necessary to aspirate marrow.) Flush with crystalloid solution.
Observe for fluid extravasation. Marrow can be sent to determine glucose levels, chemistries, blood types and cross-­matches, hemoglobin
levels, blood gas analyses, and cultures.
e.	Attach standard IV tubing. Increased pressure (through pressure
bag or push) may be necessary for infusion. There is a high risk
for obstruction if continuous high-­pressure fluids are not flushed
through the IO needle.
5.	A video on IO catheter placement is available on the New England Journal
of Medicine’s website.
H. Umbilical Artery and Umbilical Vein Catheterization2
1.	Indications: Vascular access (via umbilical vein [UV]), blood pressure
monitoring (via umbilical artery [UA]), or blood gas monitoring (via UA)
in critically ill neonates.
2.	Complications: Infection, bleeding, hemorrhage, perforation of vessel,
thrombosis with distal embolization, ischemia or infarction of lower extremities, bowel, or kidney, arrhythmia if catheter is in the heart, air embolus.
3.	Contraindications: Omphalitis, peritonitis, possible/confirmed necrotizing
enterocolitis, intestinal hypoperfusion.
4.	Line placement:
a.	Umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) line: Low line vs. high line.
(1)	Low line: Tip of catheter should lie just above the aortic bifurcation between L3 and L5. This avoids renal and mesenteric arteries near L1, possibly decreasing the incidence of thrombosis or
ischemia.
(2)	High line: Tip of catheter should be above the diaphragm
between T6 and T9. A high line may be recommended in infants
weighing less than 750 g, in whom a low line could easily slip
out.
b.	Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) lines should be placed in the inferior vena cava above the level of the ductus venosus and the hepatic
veins and below the level of the right atrium.
c.	Catheter length: Determine the length of catheter required using
either a standardized graph based on shoulder-­umbilical length or
the following birth weight (BW) regression formula:
(1)	UAC Low Line (cm) = BW (kg) × 7
(2)	UAC High Line (cm) = (3 × BW (kg)) + 9
(3)	UVC Length (cm) = 0.5 × UAC high line (cm) + 1.
5.	Procedure for UAC line (Fig. 4.5):

Placement of umbilical arterial catheter. (A) Dilating lumen of umbilical artery. (B)
Insertion of umbilical artery catheter. (From Dieckmann R, Fiser D, Selbst S. Pediatric
Emergency and Critical Care Procedures. St. Louis: Mosby; 1997.)

a.	Determine the length of the catheter to be inserted for either high (T6
to T9) or low (L3 to L5) position.
b.	Restrain infant. Maintain the infant’s temperature during the procedure. Prepare and drape the umbilical cord and adjacent skin using
sterile technique.
c.	Flush the catheter with sterile saline solution before insertion. Ensure
that there are no air bubbles in the catheter or attached syringe.
d.	Place sterile umbilical tape around the base of the cord. Cut through
the cord horizontally about 1.5 to 2 cm from the skin; tighten the
umbilical tape to prevent bleeding.
e.	Identify the one large, thin-­walled UV and two smaller, thick-­walled
arteries. Use one tip of open, curved forceps to gently probe and
dilate one artery. Then use both points of closed forceps, and dilate
artery by allowing forceps to open gently.

76  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
f.	Grasp the catheter 1 cm from its tip with toothless forceps and
insert the catheter into the lumen of the artery. Aim the tip toward
the feet and gently advance the catheter to the desired distance. Do
not force. If resistance is encountered, try loosening umbilical tape,
applying steady and gentle pressure, or manipulating the angle of the
umbilical cord to the skin. Often the catheter cannot be advanced
because of the creation of a “false luminal tract.” There should be
good blood return when the catheter enters the iliac artery.
g.	Confirm catheter tip position with x-­ray or ultrasound. Secure
catheter with a suture through the cord, a marker tape, and a tape
bridge. The catheter may be pulled back but not advanced once the
sterile field is broken.
h.	Observe for complications: Blanching or cyanosis of lower extremities, perforation, thrombosis, embolism, or infection. If any complications occur, the catheter should be removed.
i.	Use isotonic fluids containing heparin per institutional policy. Never
use hypoosmolar fluids in the UA.
6.	Procedure for UVC line (see Fig. 4.5):
a.	Determine the desired length and follow steps “a” through “d” for
UA catheter placement.
b.	Isolate the thin-­walled UV, clear thrombi with forceps, and insert
catheter, aiming the tip toward the right shoulder. Gently advance
the catheter to the desired distance. Do not force. If resistance is
encountered, try loosening the umbilical tape, applying steady and
gentle pressure, or manipulating the angle of the umbilical cord to
the skin. Resistance is commonly met at the abdominal wall and
again at the portal system. Do not infuse anything into the liver.
c.	Confirm catheter tip position with x-­ray or ultrasound. Secure
catheter with a suture through the cord, a marker tape, and a tape
bridge. The catheter may be pulled back but not advanced once the
sterile field is broken.
7.	A video on UVC/UAC line placement is available on the New England
Journal of Medicine’s website.

VI. PULMONARY PROCEDURES
A. Use of Metered-­Dose Inhalers and Spacer6
1.	Indications: Delivery of medication to distal airways in the lungs.
2.	Complications: Failure of medication delivery. Note that there are risks
associated with the medication rather than the delivery method.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Shake the inhaler, remove the cap, and attach it to the spacer device.
b.	Instruct the child to exhale completely.
c.	Place the mouthpiece of the spacer into the patient’s mouth, and
instruct the child to make a complete seal with the lips. Alternatively,
a spacer with a mask can be placed over the child’s mouth if they
are unable to make a seal with their lips.

d.	Spray 1 puff from the inhaler into the spacer and instruct the patient
to breathe slowly and deeply, holding the breath for 10 seconds.
e.	Wait 1 minute and repeat as indicated.
B. Needle Cricothyrotomy6,14
1.	Indications: When an emergency airway is required and the clinician
is unable to use bag-­mask ventilation or secure an orotracheal or
nasotracheal airway. Common indications include facial fractures, blood
or vomitus in the airway, airway obstruction (e.g., foreign body, tumor,
edema from trauma).
2.	Contraindications: No absolute contraindications. Relative contraindications include unable to locate landmarks, laryngotracheal damage,
coagulopathy, bleeding dyscrasia.
3.	Complications: Bleeding, hypoxia, pneumothorax, esophageal laceration, vocal cord injury, posterior tracheal wall perforation, infection.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Immobilize the larynx with the nondominant hand and identify the
cricothyroid membrane. This is located by palpating the laryngeal
prominence at midline of the thyroid cartilage and then moving
distally 1 to 2 cm to a small depression. This depression overlies the
cricothyroid membrane.
b.	Insert a 12 to 14-­gauge angiocatheter caudally at a 30-­to 45-­degree
angle through the cricothyroid membrane while aspirating the needle
as it is inserted.
c.	Attach the needle to an oxygen source that can deliver roughly 30
psi. Alternatively, a bag-­valve device can be connected using a 7.0
endotracheal tube adapter and a 3 mL syringe with plunger removed.
d.	Intermittent ventilation can be achieved by cutting a small hole in the
oxygen tubing, and covering the hole in the tubing. Allow for expiration by uncovering the hole for 4 to 10 seconds.
C. Needle Thoracostomy2,15
1.	Indications: Evacuation of a pneumothorax, hemothorax, chylothorax, large pleural effusion, or empyema for diagnostic or therapeutic
purposes.
2.	Complications: Infection, bleeding, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion or laceration, puncture of diaphragm, spleen, or liver, or
bronchopleural fistula.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Prepare and drape the skin as clean as possible, with goal of sterility.
b.	Insert a large-­bore angiocatheter (14-­to 22-­gauge based on patient
size and likely depth of the chest wall) into the anterior second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. Insert needle over superior
aspect of rib margin to avoid neurovascular structures. If the angiocatheter permits, a 3-­to 10-­mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of saline can
be connected to it. Aspirating the syringe while inserting the IV will
pull air bubbles through the saline if an air collection exists. A rush of
bubbles signifies successful access.

c.	When pleural space is entered, withdraw needle and attach catheter
to a three-­way stopcock and syringe, and aspirate air. The stopcock
is used to stop air flow through the catheter when sufficient evacuation has been performed.
d.	Subsequent insertion of a chest tube is often necessary for ongoing
release of air. It is advised not to completely evacuate chest prior to
placement of chest tube to avoid pleural injury.
4.	A video on needle decompression of spontaneous pneumothorax is available on the New England Journal of Medicine’s website.

VII. GASTROINTESTINAL PROCEDURES
A. Nasogastric Tube Placement6,16
1.	Indications: Enteral nutrition, administration of medications, treatment of
ileus or obstruction, gastric decompression.
2.	Contraindications: Esophageal stricture, esophageal varices, severe midface trauma (cribriform plate disruption), bleeding diatheses, alkaline
ingestion.
3.	Complications: Malposition, coiling of tube, esophageal perforation,
pneumothorax.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Approximate the length of 6-­to 10-­Fr tube insertion by positioning
the tube from the nares or mouth to the ear, then to the mid-­xyphoid-­
umbilicus. Mark this length on the tube with marker.
b.	The patient should be sitting as upright as possible. The head should
be tilted toward the chest.
c.	Lubricate the tube and insert the tube through the nose. Advance
the tube to the length mark, asking the patient to swallow while the
tube is inserted. It may be helpful to provide a cup of water with a
straw.
d.	Confirm placement of the tube with a radiograph of the lower chest/
upper abdomen. Ensure that the tube is located distal to the carina,
crosses the diaphragm, and rests in a central position in the gastric
region. The tube should not cross the midline. Additional confirmation can be obtained by testing the pH of aspirated contents. A of
pH 1 to 4 confirms proper positioning. Alternatively, insert a small
amount of air (20 to 30 mL) through the tube while listening to the
gastric area with a stethoscope.
e.	Secure the tube.
B. Gastrostomy Tube Replacement6,17
1.	Indications: Dislodged, blocked, or replacement of gastrostomy tube
(G-­tube) or gastrostomy button.
2.	Complications: Perforation, bleeding, pneumoperitoneum, creation of
“false track” particularly if tube is newly placed. Note that misplacement
and associated complications are rare for children with a mature G-­tube
track undergoing tube replacement in a pediatric emergency room.

3.	Procedure:
a.	Deflate balloon completely with a syringe and pull the tube out
steadily.
b.	Insert new tube in the stoma and inflate balloon fully with water.
Gently tug on the tube to assess whether the balloon is inflated.
Secure the tube.
c.	Confirm intragastric placement by aspirating gastric contents.
d.	If replacement tube is not immediately available, a Foley catheter of similar size may be placed using the method above to maintain tract patency.
e.	If the G-­tube track is too constricted for placement of G-­tube, consider upsizing with Foley catheter serial dilation.
4.	A video on gastrostomy tube exchange is available on the New England
Journal of Medicine’s website.

VIII. GENITOURINARY PROCEDURES
A. Urinary Bladder Catheterization3,6,18
1.	Indications: To obtain urine for urinalysis and sterile culture, to accurately monitor hydration status, and bladder decompression.
2.	Complications: Hematuria, infection, trauma to urethra or bladder, intravesical knot of catheter (rarely occurs).
3.	Contraindications: Pelvic fractures, known trauma to the urethra, or
blood at the meatus.
4.	Catheter Selection: 5 Fr for children younger than 6 months; 8 Fr for
children between 6 months and adolescence; 10 Fr for adolescents.
5.	Procedure:
a.	For collection of urinalysis and/or urine culture, the infant/child
should not have voided within 1 hour of procedure.
b.	Prepare the urethral opening using sterile technique.
c.	In males, apply gentle traction to the penis to straighten the urethra.
In uncircumcised male infants, expose the meatus with gentle retraction of the foreskin. The foreskin has to be retracted only far enough
to visualize the meatus.
d.	In girls, the urethral orifice may be difficult to visualize, but it is usually immediately superoanterior to the vaginal orifice.
e.	Gently insert a lubricated catheter into the urethra. Slowly advance
catheter until resistance is met at the external sphincter. Continued
pressure will overcome this resistance, and the catheter will enter
the bladder. Only a few centimeters of advancement are required to
reach the bladder in girls. In boys, insert a few centimeters longer
than the shaft of the penis.
f.	Carefully remove the catheter once specimen is obtained, and
cleanse skin of iodine.
g.	If indwelling Foley catheter is inserted, inflate balloon with sterile
water or saline as indicated on bulb, then connect catheter to drainage tubing attached to urine drainage bag. Secure catheter tubing to
inner thigh.

Chapter 4 Procedures  79

80  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
6.	Videos on catheterization of the male urethra and catheterization of the
female urethra are available on the New England Journal of Medicine’s
website.
B. Suprapubic Bladder Aspiration2
1.	Indications: To obtain urine in a sterile manner for urinalysis and culture
in children younger than 2 years (avoid in children with genitourinary
tract anomalies, coagulopathy, or intestinal obstruction). This bypasses
distal urethra, thereby minimizing risk for contamination.
2.	Complications: Infection (cellulitis), hematuria (usually microscopic),
intestinal perforation.
3.	Procedure (Fig. 4.6):
a.	Anterior rectal pressure in girls or gentle penile pressure in boys may
be used to prevent urination during the procedure. Child should not
have voided within 1 hour of procedure.
b.	Restrain child in the supine, frog leg position. Prepare suprapubic
area in a sterile fashion.
c.	The site for puncture is 1 to 2 cm above the symphysis pubis in the
midline. Use a syringe with a 22-­gauge, 1-­inch needle, and puncture
at a 10-­to 20-­degree angle to the perpendicular, aiming slightly
caudad.
d.	Ultrasound guidance:
(1)	Ultrasound can be used to visualize the urinary bladder for this
procedure as follows: Use the curvilinear or linear probe. Apply
the probe in transverse position in the midline of the lower abdomen, positioning it to locate the bladder. The bladder is a midline
structure with a dark center and bright margins. The shape of
the bladder is usually rounded; however, it can appear spherical,
pyramidal, or even cuboidal (Fig. 4.7).
(2)	The bladder may be empty as well with no dark cavity. If no clear
structure, give fluids and reassess in 30 minutes. This technique
can also be used in the evaluation of anuric patients, to differentiate between decreased urine production and urinary retention.
This is also useful in the case of patients with a urinary catheter
as the catheter is usually visible. If it is visualized and the bladder also has urine around it, the catheter is likely malfunctioning.
(3)	Aspiration can be performed after marking the site with ultrasound, proceeding with preparing and draping the patient and
proceeding to puncture.
e.	Gently exert suction as the needle is advanced until urine enters
syringe. The needle should not be advanced more than 3 cm.
Aspirate urine with gentle suction.
f.	Remove needle, cleanse skin of iodine, and apply a sterile bandage.
4.	A video of suprapubic bladder aspiration is available on the New England
Journal of Medicine’s website.

IX. MUSCULOSKELETAL PROCEDURES
A. Basic Splinting2
1.	Indications: To provide short-­term stabilization of limb injuries while
accommodating swelling associated with acute injuries.
2.	Complications: Pressure sores, dermatitis, neurovascular impairment.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Determine style of splint needed (see Section IX.B).
b.	Measure and cut fiberglass or plaster to appropriate length. If using
plaster, upper-­extremity splints require 8 to 10 layers and lower-­
extremity splints require 12 to 14 layers.
c.	Pad extremity with copious cotton roll padding, taking care to overlap
each turn by 50%. In prepackaged fiberglass splints, additional
padding is not generally required. Bony prominences may require
additional padding. Place cotton between digits if they are in a splint.
d.	Immerse plaster slabs into room temperature water until bubbling
stops. Smooth out wet plaster slab, avoiding any wrinkles. Fiberglass
splints will harden when exposed to air; however, application of a
small amount of room temperature water can accelerate this process.
e.	Position splint over extremity and mold to desired contour. Wrap with
an elastic bandage to hold molded splint onto extremity in position of

function. Continue to hold desired form of splint upon extremity until
fully hardened.
f.	NOTE: Plaster becomes warm while drying. Using warm water will
decrease drying time. This may result in inadequate time to mold
splint. Turn edge of the splint back on itself to produce a smooth
surface. Take care to cover the sharp edges of fiberglass.
g.	Use crutches or slings as indicated.
h.	The need for orthopedic referral should be individually assessed.
i.	Emergent orthopedic referral may be required, including when there
is concern for neurovascular compromise or compartment syndrome
of the affected extremity.
4.	Postsplint Care:
a.	Standard rest, ice, and elevation of affected extremity should be
performed.
b.	Avoid weight bearing on splinted extremity.
c.	Do not get splint wet. Splints can be wrapped in water-­resistant items
such as a plastic bag or a specially designed splint bag to allow for
showering. Use a hair dryer in instances where the splint has accidentally gotten wet.
d.	Do not stick items such as a pen or clothes hanger to scratch inside
the splint.
e.	If areas in or distal to the splint develop numbness, tingling, increased
pain, turn blue or pale, or become swollen, patient should loosen the
elastic bandage of the splint. Instruct to seek immediate medical care
if this does not quickly (<30 minutes) resolve these symptoms.
5.	A video on basic splinting techniques is available on the New England
Journal of Medicine’s website.
B. Selected Splints and Indications (Fig. 4.8)
1.	Long Arm Posterior Splint
a.	Indications: Immobilization of elbow and forearm injuries.
b.	Procedure: Elbow flexed at 90 degrees, forearm in neutral position,
slight dorsiflexion of the wrist. Splint extends from palmar crease of
the hand to mid upper arm along the ulnar side of the forearm and the
posterior aspect of the humerus. Width should be semicircumferential.
2.	Sugar Tong Forearm Splint
a.	Indications: For distal radius and wrist fractures; to immobilize the
elbow and minimize pronation and supination.
b.	Procedure: Elbow flexed at 90 degrees, forearm in neutral position,
and slight dorsiflexion of the wrist. Splint extends from palmar crease
along volar aspect of forearm, around elbow, and dorsally to the
metacarpals. Fingers and thumb remain free. Width should support
arm on both sides but not overlap.
3.	Ulnar Gutter Splint
a.	Indications: Nonrotated fourth or fifth (boxer) metacarpal metaphyseal fracture with less than 20 degrees of angulation, uncomplicated
fourth and fifth phalangeal fracture.

splint. (G) Ankle stirrup splint.

b.	Assess for malrotation, displacement (especially Salter I type fracture), angulation, and joint stability before splinting.
c.	Procedure: Elbow in neutral position, wrist in slight dorsiflexion,
metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint at 60 to 90 degrees, interphalangeal (IP) joint at 20 degrees. Apply splint in U shape from the
tip of the fifth digit to 3 cm distal to the volar crease of the elbow.
Splint should be wide enough to enclose the fourth and fifth
digits.
4.	Thumb Spica Splint
a.	Indications: Nonrotated, nonangulated, nonarticular fractures of the
thumb metacarpal or phalanx, ulnar collateral ligament injury (gamekeeper’s or skier’s thumb), scaphoid fracture or suspected scaphoid
fracture (pain in anatomic snuff box).
b.	Procedure: Wrist in slight dorsiflexion, thumb in some flexion and
abduction, IP joint in slight flexion. Apply splint in U shape along
radial side of forearm extending from tip of thumb to mid-­forearm.
Mold the splint along the long axis of the thumb so that thumb
position is maintained. This will result in a spiral configuration along
the forearm with maintained apposition of the index finger and
thumb.
5.	Volar Splint
a.	Indications: Wrist immobilization for wrist sprains, strains, or certain
fractures.
b.	Procedure: Wrist in slight dorsiflexion. Apply splint on palmar surface
from the MP joint to 2 to 3 cm distal to the volar crease of the elbow.
It is useful to curve the splint to allow the MP joint to rest at an 80-­to
90-­degree angle.
6.	Posterior Ankle Splint
a.	Indications: Immobilization of ankle sprains and fractures of the foot,
ankle, and distal fibula.
b.	Procedure: Place patient in prone position with ipsilateral knee flexed
at 90 degrees and affected ankle held in flexion at 90 degrees. Splint
should extend from base of toes to upper portion of the calf. Width
should match that of the foot. An ankle stirrup (sugar tong) splint can
be added to increase stability for ankle fractures.
7.	Ankle Stirrup Splint
a.	Indications: Immobilization of the ankle.
b.	Procedure: Ankle held in flexion at 90 degrees. Splint extends in
U-­shaped fashion from fibular head underneath the ankle to just
below the knee. Width should be one half of the narrowest circumference of the lower leg and not overlapping. May be used alone or in
combination with (placed after) posterior ankle splint.
C. Radial Head Subluxation (Nursemaid’s Elbow) Reduction19
1.	Presentation: Commonly occurs in children aged 1 to 4 years with a
history of inability to use an arm after it was pulled. Child presents with
affected arm held at the side in pronation, with elbow slightly flexed.

4

Chapter 4 Procedures  85

86  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
2.	Caution: Rule out a fracture clinically before doing procedure. Consider
radiograph if mechanism of injury or history is atypical or if exam is
concerning for fracture (swelling, bruising, tenderness, etc.).
3.	Procedure:
a.	Two most common techniques include hyperpronation (HP) and
traditional supination-­flexion (SF) maneuvers. Recent meta-­analyses
of randomized trials evaluating the two techniques favor HP for both
efficacy and pain tolerance.
b.	Support the elbow with one hand, and place your thumb laterally
over the radial head at the elbow applying pressure medially. With
your other hand, grasp the child’s hand in a handshake position or at
the wrist. The child’s thumb should point downward.
c.	HP method: Forcefully pronate the wrist. You may feel a click as
reduction occurs.
d.	SF method: Quickly and deliberately supinate and externally rotate
the forearm, and simultaneously flex the elbow.
e.	Most children will begin to use the arm within 15 minutes, some
immediately after reduction. If reduction occurs after a prolonged
period of subluxation, it may take the child longer to recover use of
the arm. In this case, the arm should be immobilized with a posterior
splint.
f.	If procedure is unsuccessful, consider obtaining a radiograph.
Maneuver may be repeated if needed.
4.	A video on reduction of nursemaid’s elbow is available on the New
England Journal of Medicine’s website.
D. Finger/Toe Dislocation Reduction2
1.	Indications: IP and MP/metatarsophalangeal dislocations.
2.	Complications: Fracture of phalanges, entrapment of neurovascular
structures.
3.	Cautions: Volar dislocations and dorsal dislocations with interposition of
the volar plate or entrapment of the metacarpal/metatarsal head often
cannot be performed using closed reduction.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Evaluate for neurovascular compromise in the affected digit. Perform
radiographs to evaluate for possible fracture.
b.	Consider procedural sedation or a digital block prior to procedure.
c.	Grasp the digit proximal to fracture to allow for stabilization.
d.	Grasp the tip of the distal digit and apply longitudinal traction, with
the joint typically slipping into place.
e.	Alternatively, grasp the distal phalanx and mildly hyperextend to
accentuate the deformity while applying longitudinal traction.
f.	After reduction, again evaluate neurovascular status and obtain
radiographs to ensure proper position and to further evaluate for
fracture.
g.	Immobilize the joint using a padded splint using full extension for
distal IP joints and 20 to 30 degrees of flexion for proximal IP joints.

E. Knee Arthrocentesis2
1.	Indications: Evaluation of fluid for the diagnosis of disease, including
infectious, inflammatory, and crystalline disease, and removal of fluid for
relief of pain and/or functional limitation.
2.	Contraindications: Bleeding diathesis, local fracture, overlying skin
infection.
3.	Complications: Pain, bleeding, infection.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Place child supine on exam table with knee in slight flexion, with use of
a padded roll underneath the knee for support, if unable to slightly flex.
b.	The lateral or medial approach can be made, with the lateral
approach preferred to avoid the vastus medialis muscle.
c.	The puncture point should be at the posterior margin of the patella in
both cases.
d.	Prepare the overlying skin in a sterile fashion, and once cleaned, numb
the area using 1% lidocaine with a small-­gauge needle. Then, using an
18-­gauge needle attached to a syringe, puncture the skin at a 10-­to
20-­degree downward angle, and advance under continuous syringe
suction until fluid is withdrawn, indicating entry into the joint space.
e.	In large effusions, several syringes may be needed for complete fluid
removal if so desired, and the needle may have to be redirected to
access pockets of fluid.
f.	Upon completion, withdraw the needle and cover the wound with a
sterile gauze dressing.
g.	Synovial fluid can then be sent for studies as indicated.
5.	A video on knee arthrocentesis is available on the New England Journal
of Medicine’s website.
F. Hematoma Blocks20
1.	Indications: Analgesia for closed fracture of the extremity that requires
manipulation or closed reduction. It is an alternative when procedural
sedation is not possible or is impractical.
2.	Contraindications: Allergic reactions to local anesthetic agents, open
fracture, cellulitis overlying fracture site, presence of a neurovascular
deficit or vascular deficit.
3.	Complications: Rare, but include compartment syndrome, local anesthetic toxicity (circumoral and tongue numbness, dizziness, tinnitus,
and visual disturbances), and osteomyelitis.
4.	Procedure:
a.	Perform using aseptic technique.
b.	Draw up the local anesthetic solution into a syringe with a 22-­or
23-­gauge, 2-­inch-­long needle. Bupivacaine, for postprocedure analgesia, is desired and can be used alone or mixed with lidocaine in a
50:50 ratio. (See Chapter 6 for dosage maximum.)
c.	Place a wheal of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously over the fracture site.
Allow 1 to 2 minutes for the anesthetic to take effect.

4

Chapter 4 Procedures  87

88  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
d.	Slowly insert and advance the needle attached to the local anesthetic
solution through the skin wheal and aimed at the fracture site. C-­arm
fluoroscopy can aid fracture/hematoma localization. Slowly advance
the needle.
(1)	Aspirate with the syringe to ensure there is no free flow of blood,
which indicates that the needle is within a blood vessel. If there
is free blood flow, do not inject the local anesthetic solution.
(2)	A flash, without flow, of blood indicates entry of the tip of the
needle into the hematoma.
(3)	Redirect needle if you strike bone or if no flash of blood is
returned.
e.	Once flash, without flow, is obtained, slowly inject the local anesthetic
solution into the hematoma.
f.	Reposition the needle to different areas within the hematoma and
inject small amounts of the local anesthetic into each area. This
technique distributes the local anesthetic solution to increase the
efficacy of the hematoma block and minimizes the risk of intravascular injection of the entire dose of local anesthetic.
g.	Withdraw the needle, apply a bandage to the skin puncture site, and
await analgesia.

X. SKIN/DERMATOLOGIC PROCEDURES
A. Immunization and Medication Administration3
NOTE: Please see Chapters 16 and 30 for relevant vaccines and medications and their appropriate administration routes.
1.	Subcutaneous Injections
a.	Indications: Immunizations and medications.
b.	Complications: Bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, lipohypertrophy
or lipoatrophy after repeated injections.
c.	Procedure:
(1)	Locate injection site: Upper outer arm or outer aspect of upper
thigh.
(2)	Cleanse skin with alcohol.
(3)	Insert 0.5-­inch, 25-­or 27-­gauge needle into subcutaneous layer
at a 45-­degree angle to the skin. Aspirate for blood, if none present, inject medication/immunization.
2.	Intramuscular (IM) Injections
a.	Indications: Immunizations and other medications.
b.	Complications: Bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, nerve injury.
c.	Cautions
(1)	Avoid IM injections in a child with a bleeding disorder or
thrombocytopenia.
(2)	Maximum volume to be injected is 0.5 mL in a small infant, 1
mL in an older infant, 2 mL in a school-­aged child, and 3 mL in
an adolescent.

d.	Procedure
(1)	Locate injection site: Anterolateral upper thigh in smaller child
or outer aspect of upper arm (deltoid) in older one. The dorsal
gluteal region is less commonly used because of risk for nerve
or vascular injury. To find the ventral gluteal site, form a triangle
by placing your index finger on the anterior iliac spine and your
middle finger on the most superior aspect of the iliac crest. The
injection should occur in the middle of the triangle formed by the
two fingers and the iliac crest.
(2)	Cleanse skin with alcohol.
(3)	Pinch muscle with free hand, and insert 1-­inch, 23-­or 25-­gauge
needle until hub is flush with skin surface. For deltoid and ventral gluteal muscles, needle should be perpendicular to skin. For
anterolateral thigh, needle should be at a 45-­degree angle to the
long axis of the thigh. Aspirate for blood; if none present, inject
medication.
B. Basic Laceration Repair2
1.	Wound Irrigation21,22: Numerous studies, including a large Cochrane
review, conclude that there is no difference in the infection rates of
wounds irrigated with either tap water or sterile NS. The volume of
irrigation depends on the location and size of the wound; 100 mL/1
cm of laceration is a good approximation for relatively uncontaminated
wounds.
2.	Suturing:
a.	Basic Suturing Technique (Fig. 4.9):
(1)	Simple interrupted: Basic closure of most uncomplicated
wounds.
(2)	Horizontal mattress: Provides eversion of wound edges.
(3)	Vertical mattress: For added strength in areas of thick skin or
areas of skin movement; provides eversion of wound edges.
(4)	Running intradermal: For cosmetic closures.
(5)	Deep dermal: For bringing together deeper portions of wounds
with dissolving sutures to allow improved approximation and
closure of superficial surfaces.
b.	Procedure:
(1)	See Tables 4.1–4.3 for sutures material, size, and time for
removal.23
(2)	NOTE: Lacerations of the face, lips, hands, genitalia, mouth,
or periorbital area may require consultation with a specialist.
Ideally, lacerations at increased risk for infection (areas with
poor blood supply, contaminated, or crush injury) should be
sutured within 6 hours of injury. Clean wounds in cosmetically
important areas may be closed up to 24 hours after injury in
the absence of significant contamination or devitalization. In
general, bite wounds should not be sutured except in areas

GUIDELINES FOR SUTURE MATERIAL, SIZE, AND REMOVAL23

92  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
(4)	Anesthetize the wound with topical anesthetic or with lidocaine
mixed with bicarbonate (with or without epinephrine) by injecting
the anesthetic into the subcutaneous tissues (see Chapter 6).
(5)	Forcefully irrigate the wound as per above. This is the most
important step in preventing infection.
(6)	Prepare and drape the patient for a sterile procedure.
(7)	Débride the wound when indicated. Probe for foreign bodies
as indicated. Consider obtaining a radiograph if a radiopaque
foreign body is suspected.
(8)	Select suture type for percutaneous closure (see Tables
4.1–4.3).
(9)	Match layers of injured tissues. Carefully match the depth of the
bite taken on each side of the wound when suturing. Take equal
bites from both wound edges. Apply slight thumb pressure on
the wound edge as the needle is entering the opposite side.
Pull the sutures to approximate wound edges but not too tightly,
to avoid tissue necrosis. In delicate areas, sutures should be
approximately 2 mm apart and 2 mm from the wound edge.
Larger bites are acceptable where cosmesis is less important.2
(10)	When suturing is complete, apply topical antibiotic and sterile
dressing. If laceration is in proximity of a joint, splinting of the
affected area to limit mobility often speeds healing and prevents
wound dehiscence.
(11)	Check wounds at 48 to 72 hours in cases where wounds are of
questionable viability, if wound was packed, or for patients prescribed prophylactic antibiotics. Change dressing at checkup.
(12)	For hand lacerations, close skin only; do not use subcutaneous
stitches. Elevate and immobilize the hand. Consider consulting
a hand or plastics specialist.
(13)	Consider the need for tetanus prophylaxis (see Chapter 16).
c.	A video on basic laceration repair is available on the New England
Journal of Medicine’s website
3.	Skin Staples
a.	Indications:
(1)	Best for scalp, trunk, extremity lacerations.
(2)	More rapid application than sutures, but can be more painful to
remove.
(3)	Lower rates of wound infection.
b.	Contraindications:
(1)	Not for areas that require meticulous cosmesis.
(2)	Avoid in patients who require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or CT.
c.	Procedure:
(1)	Apply topical anesthetic, as above. Injection of lidocaine is not
routinely used when using staples.
(2)	Clean and irrigate wound, as with suturing.

(3)	Appose wound edges, press stapler firmly against skin at center
of apposed edges, and staple.
(4)	Apply antibiotic ointment and sterile bandage.
(5)	Left in place for the same length of time as sutures (see Table 4.1).
(6)	To remove, use dedicated staple remover.
4.	Tissue Adhesives24
a.	Indications:
(1)	For use with superficial lacerations with clean edges.
(2)	Excellent cosmetic results, ease of application, and reduced
patient anxiety.
(3)	Lower rates of wound infection.
b.	Contraindications:
(1)	Not for use in areas under large amounts of tension (e.g., hands,
joints).
(2)	Use caution with areas near the eye or over areas with hair such
as the eyebrow.
c.	Procedure:
(1)	Use pressure to achieve hemostasis and clean the wound as
explained previously.
(2)	Hold together wound edges.
(3)	Apply adhesive dropwise along the wound surface, avoiding
applying adhesive to the inside of the wound. Hold in place for
20 to 30 seconds.
(4)	If the wound is misaligned, remove the adhesive with forceps
and reapply. Petroleum jelly or similar substance can aid in
removal of skin adhesive.
(5)	Adhesive will slough off after 7 to 10 days.
(6)	Antibiotic ointments or other creams/lotions should not be
applied to the adhesive, as this can cause premature loosening
of the glue and subsequent wound dehiscence.
C. Incision and Drainage (I&D) of Abscess2
1.	Indications: Diagnostic and therapeutic drainage of soft tissue abscess.
2.	Complications: Inadequate abscess drainage, local tissue injury, pain,
scar formation, and, in rare cases, fistula formation. Consider specialized surgical evaluation for abscesses in cosmetically or anatomically
sensitive areas such as the face, breast, or the anogenital region.
3.	Ultrasound Identification: Ultrasound imaging can be used to differentiate cellulitis from abscess.
a.	Use a linear probe, place the probe over the area of interest,
and scan it systematically such that the entire area of interest is
examined.
b.	Cellulitis characteristics on ultrasound:
(1)	Increased edema; tissue may appear slightly darker, and will
have distorted, indistinct margins.
(2)	Areas may have a “cobblestone” appearance caused by edema
(Fig. 4.10).

Chapter 4 Procedures  93

94  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
c.	Abscess characteristics on ultrasound:
(1)	Dark fluid collection distinct from surrounding tissue (see Fig. 4.10).
(2)	Often round or oval in shape.
(3)	Doppler can help to distinguish between lymph nodes and fluid
collections.

FIGURE 4.10, cont’d
(C) A black (anechoic) rounded structure is noted in the soft tissue, which is characteristic of a soft tissue abscess. Some abscesses may appear dark gray depending on
the characteristics of the fluid within the abscess. (From Leeson K, Leeson B. Pediatric
ultrasound: applications in the emergency department. Emerg Med Clin North Am.
2013;31(3):809–829.)

4.	Procedure:
a.	Consider procedural sedation based upon the child’s expected
tolerance of the procedure and the location/size/complexity of the
abscess.
b.	Apply topical anesthetic cream to the abscess to numb superficial
epidermis (see Chapter 6).
c.	Prepare the overlying skin in a sterile fashion, and once cleaned,
numb the area using 1% lidocaine and a small gauge needle, performing first a circumferential field block of the abscess area followed
by direct injection to the planned incision site.
d.	Incise the skin over the abscess down to the superficial fascia using
a scalpel blade, cutting parallel to the natural crease of the skin, if
present.
e.	Using a hemostat, bluntly widen and undermine the incision to break
up any septations or loculated fluid collections. Vigorously irrigate the
wound using sterile saline to improve removal of purulent material.
f.	If desired, introduce a sterile packing strip into the wound using a
hemostat, making sure to fill in an outside-­to-­inside pattern without
overfilling.

96  Part I Pediatric Acute Care
g.	Leave a 2-­to 3-­cm tail outside the wound to facilitate removal and
cover the wound with an absorbent dressing. Packing material
should be removed in 1 to 2 days with a minimum of daily dressing
changes until healed.
h.	Consider starting antibiotics that cover staphylococcus and streptococcal species per local guidelines and resistance patterns.
5.	A video on I & D of Abscesses is available on the New England Journal of
Medicine’s website.
D. Soft Tissue Aspiration25
1.	Indications: Cellulitis that is unresponsive to initial standard therapy,
recurrent cellulitis or abscesses, immunocompromised patients in
whom organism recovery is necessary and may affect antimicrobial
therapy.
2.	Complications: Pain, infection, bleeding.
3.	Procedure:
a.	Select site to aspirate at the point of maximal inflammation (more
likely to increase recovery of causative agent than leading edge of
erythema or center).
b.	Cleanse area in a sterile fashion.
c.	Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine is optional.
d.	Fill tuberculin syringe with 0.1 to 0.2 mL of nonbacteriostatic sterile
saline, and attach to needle.
e.	Using 18-­or 20-­gauge needle (22-­gauge for facial cellulitis), advance
to appropriate depth, inject saline, aspirate fluid, and apply negative
pressure while withdrawing needle.
f.	Send fluid from aspiration for Gram stain and cultures. If no fluid is
obtained, needle can be streaked on agar plate. Consider acid-­fast
bacillus (AFB) and fungal stains in immunocompromised patients.
E. Tuberculin Skin Test Placement26
1.	Indications: Concern for exposure to tuberculosis.
2.	Contraindications: History of severe reactions to prior placements (e.g.,
necrosis, anaphylactic shock, ulcerations). Note that there is no contraindication for any other individuals including infants, children, pregnant
women, or persons who have been vaccinated with bacille Calmette-­
Guérin (BCG). Note that although a tuberculin skin test (TST) may
be placed on the same day as a receiving a live vaccine, a TST must
otherwise be placed 4 to 6 weeks after administration of a live vaccine
(if not placed that same day).
3.	Complications: Soreness, necrosis.
4.	Procedure: Inject 0.1 mL of tuberculin purified protein derivative
(PPD) with a tuberculin syringe (bevel up) into the forearm at a 5-­to
15-­degree angle. The bevel should be visible just below the skin surface. The injection should produce a pale elevation of the skin 6 to 10
mm in diameter.

5.	Follow-­Up: A TST should be read between 48 and 72 hours after administration. The reaction is measured across the forearm (perpendicular
to the long axis) in millimeters of induration (palpable, raised, hardened
area or swelling). Do not measure erythema.
6.	Interpretation: see Chapter 17.
F. Tick Removal27
1.	Indications: Visualization of tick. Urgent removal is essential, as the risk
of Lyme disease transmission significantly increases after 24 hours of
attachment with the risk highest at 48 to 72 hours.
2.	Complications: Retention of tick fragments (particularly mouthparts),
infection, granuloma formation.
3.	Procedure: Only the use of blunt, medium-­tipped, angled forceps or
protected fingers have been shown to result in effective removal of ticks.
a.	Use blunt forceps to grasp the tick at the skin surface. Lift up firmly,
applying steady pressure and without a twisting motion. Take care
to not squeeze the body of the tick, because its fluid may leak infectious material.
b.	Apply antiseptic solution to the attachment site and provide patients
with signs and symptoms of both local and systemic illness.

FIGURE EC 4.A
Transverse ultrasound view of the lumbar spine. The spinous process is labeled in
this ultrasound image of the lumbar spine, marking the anatomic midline for a lumbar
puncture. A marking line should be drawn in the cephalad-­caudad direction on the skin

XI. ONLINE CONTENT
A. Ultrasound-­Guided Lumbar Puncture
1.	Use the linear probe. Before preparing the patient, obtain a transverse
view of the spine perpendicular to its axis. In the transverse view,
identify the anatomic midline by locating the spinous process. The periosteum of the spinous process will appear as a hyperechoic, rounded
structure with dark, posterior shadowing. Center the spinous process in
the middle of the probe and mark a line in a cephalad-­caudad direction
on the patient’s back to identify the midline (Fig. EC 4.A).
2.	Rotate the probe 90 degrees to obtain a longitudinal view (probe parallel
to the spine). Identify the vertebral bodies and an intervertebral space
above or below L4. Mark a line on either side of the skin correlating with
the space (Fig. EC 4.B).
3.	The intersection of the marks identifies the area to be punctured. The
crosshairs formed by the marks should leave the actual insertion site
clean (Fig. EC 4.C).
4.	The procedure should progress with no further movement of the patient.
Preparation and draping should proceed from this point toward completion of the procedure.

center where the actual puncture site will be. (From Strony R. Ultrasound-­assisted
lumbar puncture in obese patients. Crit Care Clin. 2010;26[4]:661–664.)

B. External Jugular Puncture and Catheterization2
1.	Indications: Blood sampling in patients with inadequate peripheral
vascular access or during resuscitation.
2.	Complications: Infection, bleeding, pneumothorax.
3.	Procedure: (Fig. EC 4.D)
a.	Restrain patient securely with head turned 45 degrees to the contralateral side of cannulation. Position with towel roll under shoulders
or with head over side of bed to extend neck and accentuate the
posterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the side of
venipuncture. Place patient in the 15-­to 20-­degree Trendelenburg
position.
b.	Prepare area in a sterile fashion.
c.	The external jugular vein will distend if its most proximal segment
is occluded or if the child cries. The vein runs from the angle of the
mandible to the posterior border of the lower third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

d.	With continuous negative suction on the syringe, insert the needle at
approximately a 30-­degree angle to the skin. Continue as with any
peripheral venipuncture.
e.	Apply a sterile dressing, and put pressure on the puncture site for 5
minutes.
f.	Enter the vein at the point where it crosses the sternocleidomastoid
muscle.
g.	Proceed with peripheral catheter placement as described previously.

I. ADOLESCENT HEALTH MAINTENANCE
A. Confidentiality
Begin integrating one-­on-­one time with the provider and patient into adolescent visits as early as age 11 to provide teens with regular opportunities
to discuss concerns and sensitive topics in an open manner.1 Adolescents
are concerned about the confidentiality of their interactions with healthcare
providers.2,3 Providers should be aware of barriers to confidentiality related to
consent laws and billing/explanation of benefits by insurance companies.4
1.	Consent laws: All states and the District of Columbia allow minors to
consent to sexually transmitted infection (STI) services (diagnosis and
treatment), although some states have a minimum age to consent.
Laws surrounding consent to HIV testing and treatment, contraception,
abortion, and other healthcare services vary by state. Current information on consent laws by state can be found at the Guttmacher Institute’s
website (https://www.guttmacher.org/state-­policy/explore/overviewminors-­consent-­law).5
2.	Breach of confidentiality: Confidentiality must be breached if the
adolescent is at risk of harming themselves or others (e.g., suicidal or
homicidal ideation). Cases of child abuse or neglect must be reported to
child protective services. The definition of statutory rape and reporting laws vary by state, with minimum age to consent to sexual activity
ranging from 16 to 18 years old. Current information on reporting laws
by state can be found at the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network’s
website (https://rainn.org/public-­policy-­action).6
B. History Elements Unique to the Adolescent Patient
1.	Psychosocial development7: Progression through adolescence is characterized by cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional developments, which
help adolescents to establish their identity and autonomy. See Table EC
5.A for detailed psychosocial development by age.
2.	HEADSS assessment8–10: A screening tool for psychosocial factors, which
impact adolescent mental, physical, and sexual health (Box 5.1).
3.	Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for
substance use11:
a.	Screening: If adolescent has used any alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs
in the past 12 months, administer CRAFFT questionnaire (Box 5.2). If
not, administer only the “Car” question (Have you ever ridden in a car
with a driver who had used alcohol or drugs?).
101

102  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
BOX 5.1
HE2ADS3 (MODIFIED HEADSS) ASSESSMENT8
(H)OME: Household composition, family dynamics and relationships, living and
sleeping arrangements, recent changes, any periods of homelessness, running
away from home
(E)DUCATION/EMPLOYMENT, (E)ATING: School performance, attendance, suspensions; attitude toward school; favorite, most difficult, best subjects; special
educational needs; goals for the future; after-­school job or other work history;
body image and dieting
(A)CTIVITIES: Friendships with same or opposite sex, ages of friends, best friend,
dating, recreational activities, physical activity, sports participation, hobbies,
and interests
(D)RUGS: Personal use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, anabolic steroids; peer
substance use; family substance use and attitudes; if personal use, determine
frequency, quantity, binge, injury with use; consider use of CRAFFT questionnaire (Box 5.2)
(S)EXUALITY: Sexual orientation, gender identity, and relationship(s) should
be explored with open-­ended questions. If the adolescent is sexually active,
discuss age of first sexual act, number of lifetime and current partners, ages
of partners, knowledge of contraception and sexually transmitted infection/
human immunodeficiency virus (STI/HIV) prevention, reproductive life plan,
prior testing for STI/HIV, prior pregnancies and/or abortions, and history of
nonconsensual intimate physical contact or sex. See Box EC 5.A for the “Five
Ps” of the sexual history
(S)UICIDE/DEPRESSION: Feelings about self, both positive and negative; history
of depression or other mental health problems; sleep problems (difficulty getting to sleep, early waking); changes in appetite or weight; anhedonia; irritability; anxiety; current or prior suicidal thoughts or attempts; other self-­harming or
injurious behavior; screen for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-­2)
(S)AFETY: Feeling unsafe at home, at school, or in the community; bullying; guns
in the home; weapon carrying, what kinds of weapons; fighting; arrests; gang
membership; seatbelt use

BOX 5.2
CRAFFT QUESTIONNAIRE10
C—Have you ever ridden in a CAR driven by someone (or yourself) who was
“high” or had been using alcohol or drugs?
R—Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to RELAX, feel better about yourself, or fit in?
A—Do you ever use alcohol/drugs while you are ALONE?
F—Do your family or FRIENDS ever tell you that you should cut down on your
drinking or drug use?
F—Do you ever FORGET things you did while using alcohol or drugs?
T—Have you gotten into TROUBLE while you were using alcohol or drugs?
NOTE: Answering yes to two or more questions is a positive screen

Practicing Mental Health in Primary Care. Philadelphia, Elsevier, 2019, pp 1-­7.

Adolescent Medicine  103

b.	Brief Intervention: Stratify risk based on responses to screening
questions.
(1)	Low risk (abstinent): Reinforce decisions with praise and provide
anticipatory guidance regarding riding in a car with a driver
under the influence.
(2)	Yes to “Car” question: Counsel and encourage safety plan.
(3)	Moderate risk (CRAFFT negative): Advise cessation of substance
use, educate regarding health risks of continued use, and praise
personal attributes.
(4)	High risk (CRAFFT ≥2): Conduct in-­depth assessment using
motivational enhancement techniques, conduct brief negotiated
interview, or refer as appropriate.
c.	Referral to Treatment: Further evaluation by a specialist in mental
health/addiction can guide referral to an appropriate level of care.
4.	Social media12: Explore how social media is used and for what quantity
of time.
a.	Benefits: Communication and engagement.
b.	Risks of excessive/inappropriate use: Impaired sleep, attention,
and learning; obesity; depression; viewing of unsuitable content;
decrease in caregiver-­child interactions; compromised privacy;
meeting high-risk sexual partners or sexual predators, sexting, and
cyberbullying.

development/adolescence/social-­media.html
(2)	AAP Family Media Use Plan: www.healthychildren.org/MediaUse
Plan
5.	Menstrual history: Age of menarche, last menstrual period (LMP),
frequency/regularity and duration of menstrual cycle, reproductive life
plan, condom use, and contraceptive use.
C. Physical Examination Elements Unique to the Adolescent13,14
1.	Dentition and gums: Caries, enamel defects from tobacco use, and
enamel erosion from induced vomiting.
2.	Skin: Acne (see Chapter 8 for treatment guidelines), atypical nevi, acanthosis nigricans, rashes, evidence of cutting, piercings, and tattoos.
3.	Thyroid: Size, nodules.
4.	Breasts: Sexual maturity rating for females, masses (most commonly
fibrocystic changes and fibroadenomas in females, or gynecomastia in
males), breast asymmetry (common occurrence in adolescence; more
pronounced between Tanner pubertal stages 2 and 4).
a.	Normal female breast development: See Fig. 5.1.
b.	Physiologic gynecomastia in males:
(1)	Epidemiology: Generally, occurs in middle to late stages of
puberty (usually peaks in Tanner pubertal stage 3); occurs in
50% of boys (50% unilateral, 50% bilateral).
(2)	Etiology: Breast growth stimulated by estradiol.
(3)	Clinical course: Regression usually occurs over a 2-­year period.

(5)	Differential diagnosis: Nonphysiologic gynecomastia. Common
causes include medication or substance use, primary or secondary hypogonadism, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, tumors, and
pseudogynecomastia (excess adipose tissue on exam).
(6)	Red flags: Symptom duration over 2 years, nipple discharge,
skin changes, breast masses, and coincident testicular
abnormalities.
(7)	Treatment: Often no treatment is necessary. Severe or nonregressing cases may warrant referral to pediatric surgeon, endocrinologist, or oncologist, depending on suspected etiology.

5.	Genitalia: For both male and female genital examinations, a chaperone
should be present, an explanation should occur before the examination,
and findings should be discussed.
a.	Male15:
(1)	Normal male genital development: Table 5.1.
(2)	Normal pubic hair development: Table 5.2.
(3)	Assess for signs of STIs (rashes, warts, ulcers, erosions,
discharge), inguinal hernias, masses, hydroceles, and varicoceles. If there are symptoms of proctitis with history of receptive
anal intercourse (e.g., rectal pain, rectal bleeding, or tenesmus),
a digital rectal examination should be performed.
b.	Female16,17:
(1)	Normal pubic hair development: see Table 5.2.
(2)	External examination: Assess for signs of STIs (rashes, warts,
ulcers, erosions, discharge), discharge suggestive of candidiasis
or bacterial vaginosis, and evidence of trauma.

(3)	Pelvic examination: Speculum exams are not routinely recommended for healthy asymptomatic women under 21 years of
age. Indications for bimanual exam or speculum exam include:
vaginal discharge with lower abdominal or pelvic pain (assess
cervix for mucopurulent discharge, friability, large ectropion,
foreign body, or cervical motion tenderness), menstrual disorders
(amenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or dysmenorrhea
refractory to medical therapy), and Pap smear (see Section
I.D.6).
(4)	For suspected or reported sexual abuse or rape, refer to a
specialized center if not appropriately trained and equipped
to document evidence of trauma and collect forensic
specimens.
Note: See Chapter 10 for information about precocious and delayed
puberty.
D. Screening Laboratory Tests and Procedures
A lack of evidence has led to variability in guidelines for topics such as
screening for dyslipidemia, iron-­deficiency anemia, diabetes, and tuberculosis. The recommendations that follow are largely based on the AAP, CDC,
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).1,18–20
1.	Immunizations: See Chapter 16.
2.	Cholesterol screening: All children should undergo cholesterol screening
once between ages 9 and 11 years and once between ages 17 and 21
years.
3.	Diabetes screening: Consider screening for type 2 diabetes with hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, or oral glucose tolerance test in
children who have a BMI greater than 85% for age and sex with other
risk factors such as family history.21
4.	Consider selective screening for tuberculosis, anemia, and vision and
hearing abnormalities if patient screens positive on risk screening
questions.
5.	STI screening: See Section II.
6.	Papanicolaou (Pap) smear cervical cancer screening: Cytologic evaluation should be used. Human papilloma virus (HPV) testing is only
recommended for routine screening above age 30. Recommended
screening intervals and follow-­up depend on age, medical history, and
result of previous Pap smear, as presented in Table 5.3.

II. SEXUAL HEALTH
A. Sexually Transmitted Infection Screening Guidelines by Sexual
Behavior18,22,23
1.	All adolescents over age 13: The CDC recommends universal screening
for HIV (via HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test) at least once using an opt-­out
approach, or more frequently based on risk factors.

2.	Heterosexual with one lifetime partner:
a.	Male: Screen once with HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test; gonorrhea and
chlamydia urine nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) in high prevalence clinical settings (e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities,
STI clinics). Repeat as indicated by sexual risk.
b.	Female: Screen once with HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test; self-­or
provider-­collected vaginal NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia (routine screening recommended in sexually active women under age
25). Repeat as indicated by sexual risk. Vaginal swab is the preferred
method to screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia; self-­collected specimens may have higher patient acceptability. Vaginal swabs are as
sensitive and specific as cervical swabs, and both are more accurate
than urine samples.24
3. Heterosexual with risk factors (new partner, multiple partners, partner
with STI, intravenous drug use):
a.	Male: Annual HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, rapid plasma reagin
(RPR), and gonorrhea and chlamydia urine NAAT.
b.	Female: Annual HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, RPR, and self-­or
provider-­collected vaginal NAAT for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and
trichomonas.
c.	In adolescents with a history of an STI, repeat testing is recommended 3 months after treatment given high risk of reinfection.
4.	Men who have sex with men (MSM): Annual HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test,
RPR, and gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT (test sites of sexual contact:
pharynx, urethra, and/or rectum) are recommended. For MSM with multiple or anonymous partners, consider 3 to 6 month interval STI testing.
5.	Women who have sex with women (WSW): Equivalent STI screening as
heterosexual women, guided by sexual practices (e.g., gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT should be done at sites of sexual contact) and risk factors.
6.	Pregnant women: At the first visit, pregnant patients should be screened
with HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody test, RPR, vaginal gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT, and hepatitis B surface antigen test.
7.	Transgender: Given the diversity of transgender persons regarding patterns of sexual behavior, hormone use, and surgery, clinicians should
assess STI risk based on the patient’s sexual behaviors and current
anatomy (the latter of which should guide method of NAAT testing, if
indicated).
8.	Concern for recent exposure to STI:
a.	Fourth generation HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody tests detect acute infection within 10 to 14 days. If there is concern for acute or early HIV
exposure, consider an HIV RNA nucleic acid test.25
b.	Screen with RPR, gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT (method of testing
as described above by sexual behavior), and vaginal trichomonas
NAAT for women.
c.	Consider HSV PCR testing in individuals presenting for STI evaluation
with genital lesion(s).

B. Sexually Transmitted Infection Evaluation and Management
(Table 5.4)
1.	HIV: See Chapter 17 for information on diagnosis and treatment of HIV,
pre-­exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).
PrEP should be initiated in the primary care setting, when possible.
2.	Syphilis18
a.	Etiology: Treponema pallidum
b.	Early syphilis (within 1 year of initial infection)
(1)	Primary syphilis (chancre): Firm, usually painless sore(s) or
ulcer(s) develop at the site of initial infection (genital, rectal,
or oral). Chancres typically develop within 3 weeks of infection and heal 3 to 6 weeks after development in the absence of
treatment.
(2)	Secondary syphilis: Within weeks to months after a chancre
appears, patients may develop body rash involving palms and
soles, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, constitutional
symptoms, and/or early neurosyphilis (e.g., meningitis or ocular
syphilis).
(3)	Early latent syphilis: Asymptomatic stage.
c.	Late syphilis (over 1 year after initial infection)
(1)	Late latent syphilis: Asymptomatic stage.
(2)	Tertiary syphilis: Organ involvement may progress to cardiovascular syphilis (e.g., aortitis), late neurosyphilis (e.g., tabes
dorsalis or paresis), or gummatous syphilis.
d.	Diagnosis: Testing algorithm varies by laboratory and typically
includes a nontreponemal test (RPR or Venereal Disease Research
Laboratory [VDRL] test) and a treponemal test (e.g., fluorescent
treponemal antibody absorbed [FTA-­ABS] test, enzyme immunoassay) for confirmation.
e.	Treatment: See Table 5.4. Clinical and serologic evaluation should
be performed 6 and 12 months after treatment to ensure a fourfold
reduction in nontreponemal titers or seroreversion. Monitor for
Jarisch-­Herxheimer reaction (fever, headache, and myalgias) within
24 hours of treatment.
f.	Partner treatment: Partners with sexual contact within 90 days of
a patient’s diagnosis should be treated empirically. Partners with
sexual contact over 90 days prior to diagnosis should be evaluated for treatment based on CDC 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines:
http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/.
g.	See Chapter 17 for information on neonatal syphilis and interpretation of maternal and neonatal syphilis testing.

5

9.	Persons living with HIV: Screen at least annually with RPR, gonorrhea
and chlamydia NAAT (method of testing as described above by sexual
behavior), and vaginal trichomonas NAAT for women. Screen more
frequently if indicated by sexual risk behaviors.

3.	Chlamydia and gonorrhea18
a.	Etiology: Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
b.	Clinical manifestations: Urethritis, cervicitis, pharyngitis, proctitis,
epididymitis, prostatitis. Other manifestations include:
(1)	Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV): Lymphoproliferative
reaction caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1 to L3 that most
frequently presents as proctitis and lymphadenopathy in patients
who are MSM or HIV positive.
(2)	Disseminated gonococcal infection: Bacteremic spread of N.
gonorrhoeae results in septic arthritis or arthritis-­dermatitis
syndrome (polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis). In addition to urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal NAAT, workup should
include blood, synovial, or CSF cultures, as applicable.
c.	Diagnosis: Site-­specific NAAT, including urogenital (urine NAAT
in males, urine or vaginal NAAT in females [see Section II.A.2.b]),
pharyngeal, and rectal.
d.	Treatment: See Table 5.4.
e.	Partner treatment: Partners should be treated. For partners for whom
providers are concerned about access to prompt clinical evaluation
and treatment, expedited partner therapy may be an option depending on local and state laws.
4.	Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Acute infection of the female upper
genital tract.18
a.	Etiology: Often polymicrobial in nature, however N. gonorrhoeae and
C. trachomatis are the most commonly identified pathogens, followed
by Mycoplasma genitalium.
b.	Differential diagnosis: Endometriosis, tubo-­ovarian abscess (TOA),
ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, acute surgical abdomen, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pyelonephritis, dysmenorrhea, septic/
threatened abortion
c.	Workup: Pelvic and bimanual examination, gonorrhea/chlamydia and
HIV testing, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), wet preparation,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-­reactive protein (CRP), and
urinalysis/urine culture if clinically indicated. Consider a complete
blood cell count (CBC) with differential and pelvic ultrasound if the
patient is ill-­appearing, has an adnexal mass on bimanual examination, or is not improving after antibiotics.
d.	Minimum diagnostic criteria: Uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion
tenderness without other identifiable causes. One or more of the
following additional criteria enhances specificity: fever (>38.3°C),
mucopurulent vaginal or cervical discharge, leukocytes on saline
microscopy, increased ESR or CRP, laboratory documentation of
chlamydial or gonorrhea infection.
e.	Treatment: See Table 5.4.
f.	Admission criteria: Cannot exclude acute surgical abdomen, presence of TOA, pregnancy, immunodeficiency, severe illness, inability

to tolerate or follow outpatient oral regimen, failure to respond to
appropriate outpatient therapy, or follow-­up cannot be ensured.
5.	Trichomoniasis18
a.	Etiology: Trichomonas vaginalis
b.	Diagnosis and treatment: See Table 5.5.
c.	Follow-­up: Women treated for trichomoniasis should be retested 3
months after treatment due to high rates of reinfection.
d.	Partner treatment: Partners should be treated to prevent reinfection.
6.	Mycoplasma genitalium18
a.	Etiology: Mycoplasma genitalium
b.	Clinical manifestations: Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or PID despite
appropriate treatment.
c.	Diagnosis: No FDA-­approved diagnostic test; NAAT is available in
some large medical centers and commercial laboratories.
d.	Treatment: Moxifloxacin has been used successfully; refer to latest
CDC treatment guidelines.
7.	Vaginal infections, genital ulcers, and warts
a.	Diagnostic features of vaginal infections (see Table 5.5) can assist
in differentiating normal vaginal discharge from bacterial vaginosis,
trichomoniasis, and yeast vaginitis.
b.	Diagnostic features of genital lesions, as well as management of
warts and ulcers, are presented in Table 5.6.
C. Gender and Sexual Behavior
1.	Terminology and definitions:
a.	Sexual orientation26,27: Sexual orientation relates to sexual attraction,
identity, and behavior. It is not related to gender identity. It should be
defined by the individual patient.
b.	Gender identity: An individual’s self-­awareness as male or female.
c.	Gender expression: The way an individual expresses their gender
(e.g., clothing and speech); may differ from gender identity.
d.	Sex assigned at birth: Often based on phenotype (external genitals,
gonads, and internal sex organs) and karyotype (XX, XY, XO, XXY,
etc.); assigned at birth.
e.	Transgender: An individual whose gender identity differs from the sex
assigned at birth.
f.	Cisgender: An individual whose gender identity is the same as the
sex assigned at birth.
g.	Gender nonbinary: Gender expression by an individual that does not
match masculine and feminine gender norms.
h.	Gender dysphoria28: Discomfort or distress caused by discrepancy
between a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. DSM-­V
criteria recommends a diagnosis occur after 6 months of continuous
incongruence. For prepubescent children, the desire to be of the
other gender must be present and verbalized.
2.	Special considerations in adolescents:
a.	Adolescents may engage in a variety of sexual activities (penile-­vaginal,
anal, or oral intercourse) that do not reflect their sexual orientation (e.g.,

heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual). Conversely, adolescents may self-­
identify with a particular sexual orientation but not be sexually active.
b.	Sexual identity emerges during adolescence. It is important to provide a safe environment for adolescents to discuss questions about
their sexual identity and behavior, and ask questions about sexual
activities regardless of sexual orientation.
3.	Medical interventions for gender-­dysphoric or transgender patients29–31:
a.	Prepubertal children: Parental support and education to create a
safe environment for the child. Familial support of social transition for
transgender children has been associated with better mental health
outcomes.
b.	Pubertal suppression (reversible): GnRH analogue (e.g., Lupron and
Supprelin) can be used to suppress endogenous hormones after
onset of puberty.
c.	Gender-­affirming hormone therapy (partially irreversible): Estradiol or
testosterone therapy with gradual dose escalation initiated after a multidisciplinary team of medical and mental health providers has confirmed
the persistence of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence and sufficient
mental capacity to give informed consent (generally by the age of 16
years). Treatment can be considered as early as age 13.5 to 14 years.
d.	Gender-­affirming surgery (including gonadectomy, hysterectomy, mastectomy, and genital surgery): Not recommended until age of majority.
D. Contraception32,33
1.	Special considerations in adolescents:
a.	Over 40% of adolescents in the United States have had sexual intercourse and over 75% of adolescent pregnancies are unplanned.34,35
b.	Barriers may include confidentiality concerns (e.g., fear of parental disclosure), fear of pelvic examination, and fear of medication side effects.
c.	Long-­acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods have well-­
established safety and efficacy and are first-­line contraceptive
methods according to the ACOG and the AAP. Adherence and
continuation rates of LARC methods in adolescents are superior to
short-­acting contraceptives. To avoid a delay in initiation, quick start
method should be considered for most adolescents.36
d.	Providers should pay special attention to informed consent, confidentiality, parental involvement, insurance coverage, and cost. If an
adolescent does not have or does not want to use their insurance
coverage, refer to a clinic with Title X or other public funding (http://
www.hhs.gov/opa/).

hormonal contraceptive method and the CDC’s Selected Practice
Recommendations (http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintend
edPregnancy/USSPR.htm) for minimum requirements to start each
method.
(1)	To start a hormonal method, the basic medical history should
include assessment of clotting risk, blood pressure, pregnancy
status, and any other pertinent medical comorbidities.
(2)	Combined hormonal contraception is associated with a small
increase in risk for thrombosis including deep vein thrombosis,
myocardial infarction, and stroke.38 The risk is higher in women
who smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day, women over 35
years old, and women with other risk factors for cardiovascular
disease.
(3)	To support adherence and continuation, use a patient-­centered
approach, review method effectiveness, and provide anticipatory
guidance regarding side effects of each method when assisting
an adolescent in selecting a new contraceptive method.
b.	Quick start (Fig. 5.3): Starting a method of contraception on the day
of the visit (not waiting until a new menstrual cycle begins) should
be considered for most adolescents. Can be used for all methods,
including LARC, if there is reasonable certainty that the patient is
not pregnant (Box 5.3). A urine pregnancy test should be performed
when using this approach.39
4.	Specific contraceptive methods:
Note: Contraceptive methods are described in order of effectiveness.
a.	Intrauterine device (IUD)36: LARC inserted into the uterus. Safe to use
among adolescents, may be inserted without difficulty in most adolescents and nulliparous women; expulsion is uncommon. Among
the most effective forms of birth control. Does not increase risk of
infertility; baseline fertility returns rapidly after removal. Increased
risk of pelvic infection with placement, but the absolute risk of infection is low and exists only within the first 3 weeks after placement.
Screening is recommended for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the time
of insertion based on the CDC guidelines as age (<25 years old) is a
risk factor for STIs. Insertion should not be delayed for test results;
treatment can occur without IUD removal.
(1)	Copper (Paragard): Hormone-­free, FDA approved for 10 years of
use although data supports potential efficacy for an additional 1
to 2 years.36,40

3.	
Has been correctly and consistently using a reliable method of
contraception

contraceptive use, 2016. MMWR Recomm Rep. 2016;65(4):1–66.

(2)	Progestin-­containing (Levonorgestrel): There are four types with
differing amounts of progestin. Mirena is FDA approved for 5
years; data supports an additional 2 years.36,41 Kyleena is FDA
approved for 5 years. Liletta is FDA approved for 4 years; data
supports an additional year.36,42 Skyla is FDA approved for 3
years.
(3)	Changes in bleeding patterns are common in first months of use.
Copper IUD may cause heavier menses. Many women using
the levonorgestrel IUD will have a decrease in bleeding over
time. First-­line treatment for bleeding and spotting is NSAIDs.43
Bleeding concerns that are not associated with device insertion
should be evaluated for other etiologies.
b.	Subdermal implant: Progestin-­only LARC, 4-­cm rod inserted into
the upper arm. Newer model (Nexplanon) is radio-­opaque. FDA
approved for 3 years; studies show efficacy for up to 5 years.41
Minimal or no effect on bone density or body weight; causes a
change in bleeding patterns. Return to fertility is rapid after removal.
May be less effective for women who are overweight or obese.
Among the most effective forms of birth control.
(1)	Removal requires a small incision and takes an average of 1
minute.
(2)	Persistent irregular bleeding is the most common complaint
resulting in implant removal, but continuation rates among
adolescents remain high.44 As opposed to levonorgestrel IUD,
bleeding changes persist throughout duration of use. The
bleeding pattern in the first 3 months of use is predictive of
future bleeding. Important to provide preinsertion anticipatory
guidance. Consider postinsertion management of bleeding with
NSAIDs, combined OCPs, or doxycycline.37,45
c.	Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA [Depo-­Provera]) injection:
Progestin-­only injection into arm every 13 to 15 weeks. Typical failure

5

BOX 5.3
HOW TO BE REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT A WOMAN IS NOT PREGNANT

122  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
rate: 6%. Delayed return to fertility (9 to 18 months). Menstrual
irregularity is common, but often resolves after several cycles. May
cause weight gain, but not a uniform finding in studies.
(1)	Patient should be encouraged to receive adequate calcium and
vitamin D due to association with decrease in bone mineral
density.
(2)	FDA black box warning: Should not be used for longer than
2 consecutive years unless other forms of birth control are
inadequate due to bone mineral density concerns. Bone density
returns after discontinuation. The risk of loss of bone mineral
density should be weighed against the need for effective contraception in the context of each adolescent.39
d.	Combined hormonal oral contraceptive pills (OCPs): Combination
of estrogen and progestin taken daily. “Low-­dose” (35 mCg or less
of ethinyl estradiol) pills are the recommended dosing for adolescents. Back-­up method needed for at least 7 days after initiation.
Typical failure rates are approximately 9% and may be higher in
teens. Known to improve dysmenorrhea and are first-­line therapy for
endometriosis. Newer formulations exist, known as extended-­cycle
regimens, which reduce the number of menstrual cycles per year.
(1)	The first pill should be taken either on the day of the visit (quick
start) or between the first and seventh day after the start of the
menstrual period (most commonly Sunday).
(2)	Some pill packs have 28 pills, others have 21 pills. When the
28-­day pack is empty, immediately start taking pills from a new
pack. When the 21-­day pack is empty, wait 1 week (7 days),
then begin taking pills from a new pack.
(3)	If a pill is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered,
even if it means taking two pills in 1 day. If two or more pills
missed, two pills should be taken daily until back on schedule
and a backup method should be used for 7 days.
e.	Progestin-­only pills: Can be used for those with contraindications to
estrogen-­containing formulations. Require daily use and are more
sensitive to timing (should be taken at same time each day); have no
pill-­free interval. Considered less effective than combined hormonal
methods. Irregular bleeding is a common adverse effect.
f.	Transdermal (patch) contraceptive: Contains estrogen and progestin,
measures 1.75 × 1.75 in. Place on abdomen, upper torso, upper
outer arm, or buttocks. Use one patch for 3 weeks, then remove for
1 week for withdrawal bleed. Greater exposure to estrogen than with
other methods; may have more estrogen-­related side effects. There
may be a greater risk for thromboembolism compared to OCPs,
though the data is not clear.46 May be less effective in women who
weigh more than 90 kg.
g.	Vaginal ring: Flexible latex-­free ring that contains estrogen and
progestin. Placed in vagina for 3 weeks, removed for 1 week for

Adolescent Medicine  123

withdrawal bleeding. May be used continuously (avoiding week of
menses) by replacing with a new ring every 4 weeks (or the same
day every month) to help reduce pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. May
be removed for up to 3 hours (not recommended in adolescents).
Requires user comfort with insertion and removal. Screen for comfort
with this method by asking if the adolescent is comfortable using
tampons. Typical use failure rate similar to other combined hormonal
methods (9%).
h.	Barrier methods: Require placement prior to sexual intercourse.
Include cervical sponge, cervical cap, cervical shield, diaphragm
(these methods are used in conjunction with spermicide), as well as
female and male condoms. Male condom is most commonly used
birth control among adolescents with a failure rate of 18% with typical use.37 Use latex condoms only with water-­based lubricants; oil-­
based lubricants are not recommended. While barrier methods are
less effective than other methods of contraception, their use should
still be emphasized for prevention of STIs.
i.	Fertility awareness-­based methods of pregnancy prevention: Involves
following a woman’s menstrual cycle to help prevent pregnancy.
5.	
Emergency contraception (EC)47: Used to prevent pregnancy following
unprotected sex (including sexual assault) or a recent possible failure of
another method of contraception.
a.	Mechanism: Hormonal methods work by delaying ovulation. Copper
IUD inhibits fertilization by affecting sperm viability and function. All
methods are only effective before implantation takes place and will
not disrupt an implanted pregnancy.
b.	Efficacy48: Copper IUD is the most effective method, but requires
a clinic visit for insertion. Ulipristal is the next most effective, but
requires a prescription. Levonorgestrel is the next most effective and
is available over the counter. The Yuzpe regimen is the least effective
and has the most side effects.
c.	Timing: Hormonal methods are most effective when given as soon as
possible. Efficacy declines linearly with time but there is efficacy up
to 120 hours after intercourse. Ulipristal and copper IUD maintain
high efficacy when taken up to 120 hours after intercourse.
d.	Pregnancy should be excluded based on history, physical exam, or
pregnancy testing before prescribing ulipristal or placing an IUD, as
they may adversely affect an established pregnancy.
e.	Methods:
(1)	Progestin only: Levonorgestrel. Take 1.5 mg orally once (may be
packaged as 1.5 mg tablet or two 0.75 mg tablets).
(2)	Antiprogestins: Ulipristal (“Ella”). Take 30 mg orally once.
Mifepristone is an alternative agent used in some countries as
EC, but is not available in the U.S. for this purpose.
(3)	Ethinyl estradiol plus levonorgestrel (Yuzpe regimen): Patients
take multiple OCPs from packets designed for 28-­day use. Take

5

Chapter 5

124  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
equivalent of 100 mCg of ethinyl estradiol plus 500 mCg of
levonorgestrel. Twelve hours later, take the same dose. For more
precise instructions for a particular combination pill, refer to https://
ec.princeton.edu.
(4)	Copper IUD may be inserted within 120 hours of coitus.
f.	Guidelines:
(1)	Counseling about EC should be a routine part of anticipatory
guidance for all female and male adolescents. Advance prescriptions should be considered for all adolescents.
(2)	Antiemetics can be used to prevent nausea and should be used
prophylactically in the Yuzpe regimen.
(3)	May be combined with other ongoing methods of birth control.
(4)	OCPs may be started immediately after progestin-­only or combined hormonal EC dosing has been completed. DMPA may be
given the same day.
(5)	Patient should abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier
contraception for 7 days (14 if using ulipristal) or until next menses, whichever comes first.
(6)	Scheduled follow-­up is not required after use of EC. However,
women whose menses are delayed by a week or more, or have
any signs of pregnancy (e.g., irregular menses, abdominal cramping), should be evaluated clinically or have a pregnancy test.
6.	
Follow-­up recommendations for contraception: Two or three visits per
year to monitor compliance, blood pressure, side effects, and satisfaction with chosen birth control option.
E. Pregnancy49,50
If pregnancy is suspected in an adolescent patient, take a sexual history
and explore how the patient feels about a possible pregnancy in order to
guide the rest of the visit.
1.	Diagnosis:
a.	Perform urine hCG testing to diagnose the pregnancy. False-­positives
and false-­negatives are possible; repeat urine testing or serum hCG
testing may be indicated.
b.	If pregnancy is diagnosed, estimate the gestational age using the
LMP. Confirm with a brief exam of uterine size. When in doubt,
arrange an ultrasound and obstetric consultation promptly, as gestational age will affect counseling options.
c.	Share the diagnosis with the patient privately. Encourage them to
involve a parent or legal guardian and facilitate the discussion, if necessary. Be familiar with local confidentiality laws, which vary by state.
d.	Review the patient’s medications to ensure they are safe for pregnancy. Start patient on prenatal vitamin if not taking.
2.	Prenatal testing: All pregnant adolescents should be tested for HIV,
syphilis, hepatitis B, chlamydia, and gonorrhea at the first prenatal visit.
If an infection is suspected or if there may be a delay in obstetric care,
the pediatrician should perform the testing.

Adolescent Medicine  125

3.	Options counseling: Counsel the adolescent on the importance of making a timely decision. The options depend on gestational age, but may
include continuing the pregnancy and raising the infant, continuing the
pregnancy and making an adoption plan, or terminating the pregnancy.
If a pediatrician has personal limitations in offering a discussion of all
three options, he/she should make a prompt referral to a colleague or
consultant. Medical and surgical abortion may be available depending on
the gestational age of the pregnancy and coexisting medical conditions.
Medical abortion is generally available under 9 weeks of gestation; surgical abortion is generally available under 20 to 24 weeks of gestation.
4.	Complications: First trimester complications include ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion; immediate obstetric referral may be
indicated for abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding in the pregnant
patient.
III. TRANSITIONING ADOLESCENTS INTO ADULT CARE51
All adolescents, particularly those with special healthcare needs or chronic
conditions, benefit from careful attention to the process of transitioning to adult
care. Transition planning should routinely occur during well-­visits and should
start at age 12. Resources for how to approach and organize the transition
process including guidance on transition readiness and planning are available
at http://www.gottransition.org/. See Chapter 9 for discussion of transition to
adult care for youth with developmental disorders and disabilities.

I. PAIN ASSESSMENT
A. Infant1
1.	Physiologic response
a.	Characterized by oxygen desaturation, crying, diaphoresis, flushing or
pallor, and increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
b.	Seen primarily in acute pain; subsides with continuing/chronic pain.
2.	Behavioral response
a.	Observe characteristics and duration of cry, facial expressions, visual
tracking, body movements, and response to stimuli.
b.	Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS): Behavioral assessment tool for
the preterm neonate and full-­term neonate up to 6 weeks after birth.
c.	FLACC scale (Table 6.1): Measures and evaluates pain interventions by quantifying pain behaviors, including Facial expression, Leg
movement, Activity, Cry, and Consolability, with scores ranging from 0
to 10.2 The Revised FLACC scale is reliable in children with cognitive
impairment.3
B. Preschooler
In addition to physiologic and behavioral responses, the FACES pain scale
revised (FPS-­R) can be used to assess pain intensity in children as young
as 3 years of age by having the patient point to the image on the scale that
best characterizes their pain (Fig. 6.1).
C. School-­Age and Adolescent
Evaluate physiologic and behavioral responses; ask about description, location, and character of pain. Starting at the age of 7 years, children can use
the standard subjective pain rating scale, in which 0 is no pain and 10 is
the worst pain ever experienced.

II. ANALGESICS1
A. Safety
1.	Combined Analgesics
a.	Danger of acetaminophen toxicity when using combined opioid-­
acetaminophen products (oxycodone or hydrocodone with
acetaminophen).

b.	Preferable to prescribe opioids and acetaminophen separately.
2.	Codeine
a.	Not recommended for use in children.
b.	Five percent of the population show ultra-­rapid metabolism of
codeine to morphine (the active metabolite), which can lead to dangerously high levels. This is especially unsafe after tonsillectomy and
adenoidectomy (T&A) performed for sleep apnea.4

128  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
c.	Little to no analgesic effect in newborns and approximately 10% of
the U.S. population.5
3.	Meperidine
a.	Not recommended for use in children due to risk of neurotoxicity
(agitation, tremors, myoclonus, and seizures), especially when renal
dysfunction is present.6
b.	Contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO)
inhibitors.
4.	Tramadol
a.	Opioid pain reliever, with additional effects on nonopioid receptors.
b.	May be over-­metabolized to an active opiate metabolite, resulting in
potentially fatal respiratory depression.
c.	In 2017, the FDA issued its strongest warning against use in children; therefore, administration is considered off-­label.7
B. Nonopioid Analgesics
Weak analgesics with antipyretic activity are commonly used to manage
mild to moderate pain of nonvisceral origin. Can be administered alone or
in combination with opioids.
1.	Acetaminophen [by mouth (PO)/per rectum (PR)/intravenous (IV)]: Weak
analgesic with no antiinflammatory activity, platelet inhibition, or gastrointestinal (GI) irritation. Hepatotoxicity can occur with high doses.
2.	Aspirin (PO/PR): Associated with platelet inhibition and GI irritation.
Avoid for analgesia in pediatrics due to risk of Reye syndrome.
3.	Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Ibuprofen (PO/IV),
ketorolac [IV/intramuscular (IM)/PO/intranasal (IN)], naproxen (PO),
diclofenac (PO/IV), and celecoxib (PO).
a.	Use with extreme caution in children less than 6 months of age due
to concern for adverse GI effects and risk of renal failure.
b.	Especially useful for sickle cell disease, bony, rheumatic, and inflammatory pain.
c.	Concurrent histamine-­2-­receptor blocker or proton pump inhibitor is
recommended with prolonged use given GI side effects.
d.	Other adverse effects include interference with platelet aggregation, hepatitis, bronchoconstriction, hypersensitivity reactions, and
azotemia. Avoid in patients with severe renal disease, dehydration, or
heart failure.
NOTE: Ketorolac is a potent analgesic. Limit duration of therapy to less than
5 days to limit renal toxicity.
C. Opioids (Table 6.2)
1.	Produce analgesia by binding to μ receptors in the brain and spinal
cord.
2.	Side effects: Pruritus, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urine retention,
and (rarely) respiratory depression and hypotension. Prescribe a bowel
regimen when prescribing opioids.

TABLE 6.2
COMMONLY USED OPIOIDS

130  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Patients with renal failure.
a.	Morphine: Avoid use secondary to decreased excretion of the active
metabolite that can result in respiratory depression.
b.	Preferred choices: Fentanyl, remifentanil, methadone, hydromorphone, oxycodone.
4.	Long-­acting opioids (methadone, extended-­release tablets, and
patches) are not recommended for acute pain.
5.	Although opioids are essential for the treatment of moderate to severe
pain, a thoughtful approach is recommended with the quantity that
is dispensed, as studies have shown that over 50% of opioid doses
dispensed are not consumed.8 There is need for further research to
develop evidence-­based opioid prescribing guidelines for treating acute
pain in children.
D. Local Anesthetics9–12
Administered topically or subcutaneously to surround peripheral nerves
(peripheral block) or centrally (epidural/spinal block). Temporarily block
nerve conduction at the sodium channel.
1.	For all local anesthetics, 1% solution = 10 mg/mLb
2.	Topical local anesthetics (Table 6.3)12
3.	Injectable local anesthetics (Table 6.4):
a.	Subcutaneous infiltration of the skin at the site: Used for painful
procedures such as wound closure or lumbar puncture.
b.	Use of a 27-­to 30-­gauge needle, alkalization, warming the solution
to 37°C to 42°C, and a slow injection can reduce stinging from injection. Alkalinize by adding 1 mL (1 mEqc) sodium bicarbonate to 9 mL
lidocaine (or 29 mL bupivacaine).
c.	To enhance efficacy and duration, add epinephrine (5 to 10 mCgd of
epinephrine to 1 mL of local anesthetic) to decrease vascular uptake.
Never use local anesthetics with epinephrine in areas supplied by end
arteries (e.g., pinna, fingers, toes, nasal tip, penis).
d.	Maximum volume (mL) = (maximum mg/kg dose × weight in kg)/(%
solution × 10). See Table 6.4 for maximum doses.
e.	Toxicity: Central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity are of
greatest concern. CNS symptoms are seen before cardiovascular collapse. Always calculate the maximum volume of the local anesthetic
and always draw up less than that. Bupivacaine is associated with
more severe cardiac toxicity than lidocaine.
(1)	Progression of symptoms: Perioral numbness → dizziness →
auditory disturbances → muscular twitching → unconsciousness → seizures → coma → respiratory arrest → cardiovascular
collapse.

Medicine (ASRA) Checklist for Treatment of Local Anesthetic
Systemic Toxicity (LAST) (https://www.asra.com/content/docume

(a)	Stop injecting local anesthetic.
(b)	Call for help and obtain 20% lipid emulsion (see Fig. 6.2 for
dosing).
(c)	Manage airway: ventilate with 100% FiO2 (fraction of
inspired oxygen), insert advanced airway if needed.
(d)	Control seizures with benzodiazepines; avoid large doses of
propofol due to the potential to exacerbate hypotension.

(e)	Treat hypotension and bradycardia—start cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) if pulseless. Avoid hyperventilation.
(3)	If concerned for systemic toxicity, contact an anesthesiologist
and call poison control (1-­800-­222-­1222).
E. Nonpharmacologic Measures of Pain Relief13,14
1.	Sucrose for neonates (Sweet-­Ease):
a.	Indications: Painful minor procedures (heel lance, venipuncture,
and intramuscular injection) in neonates and infants. Has not been
shown to be effective for relief of circumcision pain. Strongest
evidence for infants aged 0 to 1 month,13 but additional evidence
suggests efficacy up to 12 months.14
b.	Procedure: Administer up to 2 mL of 24% sucrose into the infant’s
mouth by syringe or from a nipple/pacifier ∼2 minutes before the
procedure. Effective doses in very low-­birth-­weight infants may be as
low as 0.05 to 0.1 mL.
c.	An additional dose may be administered within a relatively short
period of time for multiple procedures, but it should not be administered more than twice in 1 hour.
d.	Use along with other age-­appropriate nonpharmacologic measures
listed below.
e.	Avoid if patient is unable to appropriately feed by mouth or cannot
safely handle oral secretions.
2.	Other: Parental presence/holding, distraction with toys, child life specialists, guided meditation/coping skills, virtual reality simulations.

III. PATIENT-­CONTROLLED ANALGESIA (PCA)
A. Definition
PCA enables a patient to receive a limited number of small doses (boluses)
of an analgesic with or without a continuous (basal) infusion on an as-­
needed basis. In children younger than 6 years old or with physical/mental
disability, a family member, caregiver, or nurse may administer supplemental (bolus) doses.
B. Indications
1.	Moderate to severe pain of acute or chronic nature. Commonly used in
sickle cell disease, postsurgery, posttrauma, burns, and cancer.
2.	Useful for preemptive pain management (e.g., dressing changes).
C. Routes of Administration
IV or epidural
D. Agents (Table 6.5)
E. Adjuvants
1.	Low-­dose naloxone (Narcan) infusion reduces incidence of pruritus and
nausea associated with narcotic administration.

2.	Low-­dose ketamine infusion has a narcotic sparing effect. It is especially helpful in chemotherapy-­induced mucositis, visceral pain, and
neuropathic pain. Its mechanism of action is by N-­methyl-­D-­aspartate
(NMDA) blockade. May be used with or as an alternative to methadone.
F. Side Effects of Opioid Patient-­Controlled Analgesia
Pruritus, nausea, constipation, urine retention, excessive drowsiness, and
respiratory depression.

IV. OPIOID TAPERING
A. Indications
Because of the development of dependence and potential for withdrawal,
a tapering schedule is required if the patient has received frequent opioid
analgesics for >5 days.
B. Withdrawal
1.	See Box 18.1 for symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
2.	Onset of signs and symptoms: 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of morphine and 36 to 48 hours after the last dose of methadone.
3.	Duration: 7 to 14 days, with a peak intensity reached within 2 to 4 days.
C. Recommendations for Tapering
1.	Conversion: All drugs should be converted to a single equi-­analgesic
member of that group (see Table 6.2).
2.	PCA wean: Drug dosing should be changed from continuous/intermittent IV infusion to PO basal/bolus therapy. If the patient is on PCA, once
the first PO dose is administered, the PCA basal infusion should be
stopped 30 to 60 minutes later. PCA bolus doses should be continued
but reduced by 25% to 50%. If no further bolus doses are administered
in the next 6 hours, the PCA should be discontinued. If the patient
continues to experience pain, consider increasing scheduled PO dose,
administering a rescue one-­time PO bolus dose, or adding an adjuvant
analgesic (e.g., NSAID).
3.	Slow dose decrease: During an intermittent IV/PO wean, the total daily
dose should be decreased by 10% to 20% of the original dose every 1
to 2 days (e.g., to taper a morphine dose of 40 mg/day, decrease the
daily dose by 4 to 8 mg every 1 to 2 days).

4.	Oral regimen: If not done previously, IV dosing should be converted to
equivalent PO administration 1 to 2 days before discharge, and titration
should be continued as outlined previously.
5.	Adjunctive therapy:
a.	Clonidine in combination with an opioid decreases the length of time
needed for opioid weaning in neonatal abstinence syndrome, with
few short-­term side effects. Long-­term safety has yet to be thoroughly investigated, but follow-­up after 1 year on motor, cognitive,
and language scores showed no difference in those treated with
clonidine.15,16
b.	PO and transdermal clonidine have a potential role for sedation,
analgesia, and iatrogenic drug withdrawal in critically ill children,
but current reports are retrospective or small clinical trials with
significant heterogeneity in dosing, so further research is necessary.
Transdermal dosing should not be used in children aged <1 year due
to altered skin absorption.17
c.	Studies have shown efficacy of α2-­adrenergic agonists in treating opioid withdrawal and reducing doses of methadone, but the duration
of treatment was longer with α2-­adrenergic agonists, and there were
fewer adverse effects with methadone.18
d.	Dexmedetomidine is an α2-­adrenoreceptor agonist, which produces
sedation and mild analgesia, with minimal to no respiratory depression. Administered as a continuous infusion, it has been shown to
reduce opioid requirements and facilitate opioid weaning.
D. Examples
See Box EC 6.A for example of opioid wean.

V. PROCEDURAL SEDATION1,9–12,19–21
A. Definitions
1.	Mild sedation (anxiolysis): Intent is anxiolysis with maintenance of
consciousness.
2.	Moderate sedation: Formerly known as conscious sedation. A controlled state of depressed consciousness during which airway reflexes
and patency are maintained. Patient responds appropriately to
age-­appropriate commands (e.g., “Open your eyes”) and light touch.
Practically obtained any time a combination of a sedative-­hypnotic and
an analgesic are used.
3.	Deep sedation: A controlled state of depressed consciousness during
which airway reflexes and patency may not be maintained, and the
child is unable to respond to physical or verbal stimuli. In practice, deep
sedation is required for most painful procedures in children. Practically
obtained with propofol.
4.	Dissociative sedation: Unique state of sedation achieved with ketamine characterized by a deep level of depressed consciousness and

Data from Practice guidelines for preoperative fasting and the use of pharmacologic agents to reduce the risk of

analgesia. Airway reflexes and patency are generally maintained; however, excessive oral secretions may become problematic, occasionally
resulting in micro-­aspiration or laryngospasm.
B. Preparation
1.	The patient should be NPO for solids and liquids (Table 6.6).19 Per
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, children receiving moderate sedation
for elective procedures should follow the same fasting guidelines as
those for general anesthesia.20,22 For urgent/emergent sedation when
children are not NPO, the risks of sedation and possible aspiration
must be balanced against the benefits of performing the procedure
promptly. Recent studies suggest that NPO status for liquids and solids
may not be statistically associated with aspiration, although studies are
limited as aspiration is a relatively uncommon complication.23
2.	Focused patient history:
a.	Allergies, medications, and any history of a previous reaction to
anesthesia or sedation.
b.	Assess for the possibility of an adverse airway event occurring
with sedation (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, inability to mask ventilate, etc.). This can occur from: (1) mechanical airway obstruction (micrognathia, tonsillar and/or adenoid hypertrophy, large
tongue, history of snoring, presence of noisy breathing, diagnosis
of obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, presence of a craniofacial
syndrome), (2) lung disease (history of prematurity, chronic lung
disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma), or (3) presence
of a recent upper respiratory infection (URI). A history of a URI
increases the risk of laryngospasm and/or bronchospasm; therefore, one must weigh the risks/benefits of providing sedation after
a recent URI versus need for immediate interventional procedure.
For elective procedures requiring sedation, it is best to wait 2 to
4 weeks after resolution of illness to reduce the risk of an adverse
event.24
c.	Assess aspiration risk (neuromuscular disease, esophageal disease,
altered mental status, obesity, pregnancy).

Patient on morphine patient-­controlled analgesia (PCA) to be converted to oral
(PO) morphine with home weaning.
For example: morphine PCA basal rate = 2 mg/hr, average bolus rate = 0.5 mg/hr
Step 1: Calculate daily dose: basal + bolus = (2 mg/hr × 24 hr) + (0.5 mg/hr ×
24 hr) = 60 mg intravenous (IV) morphine
Step 2: Convert according to drug potency: morphine IV/morphine oral =
approx. 3:1 potency; 3 × 60 mg = 180 mg PO morphine
Step 3: Prescribe 90 mg BID or 60 mg TID; wean 10%–20% of original dose

3.	Physical examination: Specific attention to mouth opening and neck
extension. Use the Mallampati classification system to assess the airway
for likelihood of difficult direct laryngoscopy and intubation (Fig. 6.3).
4.	Determine ASA Physical Status Classification (Table 6.7): Class I and
II patients are generally good candidates for mild, moderate, or deep
sedation outside of the operating room.20

138  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
TABLE 6.7
ASA PHYSICAL STATUS CLASSIFICATION
Class I
Class II
Class III
Class IV

Class V

Class VI

A normally healthy patient
A patient with mild systemic disease (e.g.,
controlled reactive airway disease)
A patient with severe systemic disease (e.g., a
child who is actively wheezing)
A patient with severe systemic disease that is
a constant threat to life (e.g., a child with
status asthmaticus)
A moribund patient who is not expected to
survive without the operation (e.g., a patient
with severe cardiomyopathy requiring heart
transplantation)
A declared brain-­dead patient whose organs
are being removed for donor purposes

5.	Always have an emergency plan ready:
a.	Make sure qualified backup personnel and equipment are close by.
b.	Complications most often occur 5 to 10 minutes after administration of IV medication and immediately after a procedure is
completed (when the stimuli associated with the procedure are
removed).11
6.	Personnel: Two providers are required. One provider should perform
the procedure, and a separate provider should monitor the patient during sedation and recovery.
7.	Ensure IV access prior to induction by flushing with saline.
Subcutaneous infiltration of a sedative can cause unpredictable or
prolonged sedation.
8.	Have airway/intubation equipment immediately available (see Chapter
1).
9.	Emergency medications: Always have emergency medications for rapid
sequence intubation and CPR immediately available.
10.	Reversal agents should be readily available (naloxone, flumazenil).
C. Monitoring
1.	Vital signs: Baseline vital signs should be obtained. Heart rate,
oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate should be continuously
monitored, and blood pressure monitored intermittently (every 3 to
5 minutes) until a pre-­sedation level of consciousness is achieved.
NOTE: Unrecognized apnea is often followed by desaturation within
1 to 2 minutes when not receiving supplemental oxygenation.
Administration of supplemental oxygen can further delay recognition
of apnea because the onset of desaturation may occur more than 2
minutes after apnea.
2.	Airway: Airway patency and adequacy of ventilation should be frequently assessed through capnography (e.g., continuous end-­tidal

carbon dioxide [CO2]), auscultation, and direct visualization. This can
help ensure immediate recognition of apnea, and appropriate measures
may be taken before desaturation occurs.
D. Pharmacologic Agents
1.	Goal of procedural sedation: The administration of medications to provide appropriate levels of analgesia, sedation, and anxiolysis so that the
procedure can occur without the need to secure the airway.
2.	CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression may always occur;
occurs more commonly when combining sedative drugs and/or opioids,
or with rapid drug administration. It is always best to titrate medications
to the desired level of sedation.
3.	Common sedative/hypnotic agents (Box 6.1). Also see Table 6.2
and Table 6.8 for more information on opioids and barbiturates/
benzodiazepines.
4.	Reversal agents:
a.	Naloxone: Opioid antagonist. See Box 6.2 for naloxone administration
protocol.
b.	Flumazenil: Benzodiazepine antagonist.
E. Discharge Criteria20
1.	The patient can maintain a patent airway without requiring supplemental oxygen. There should also be no compromise in cardiovascular
function.
2.	The patient should be easily arousable with intact protective airway
reflexes (swallow, cough, and gag).
3.	The patient should have the ability to talk and sit up unaided (if age
appropriate). Alternatively, for very young or intellectually disabled children, the goal is to return to their pre-­sedation level of responsiveness.
4.	Ensure ability to maintain adequate hydration (i.e., the patient can tolerate enteral fluids).

CNS effects: Emergence delirium with auditory, visual, and tactile
hallucinations
Cardiovascular effects: Inhibits catecholamine reuptake, thereby causing
increased HR, BP, SVR, and PVR. Rarely causes hemodynamic instability;
however, in catecholamine-­deplete patients (e.g., shock) it can cause direct
myocardial depression and hypotension.
Respiratory effects: Bronchodilation (useful in asthmatics), increased secretions (can result in laryngospasm), maintenance of ventilatory response to
hypoxia, relative maintenance of airway reflexes
Other effects: Increased muscle tone, myoclonic jerks, nausea, emesis
Contraindications: Hypertension and preexisting psychotic disorders.
Controversy exists on its safety in patients with elevated ICP or IOP. Evidence
suggesting ketamine elevates intracranial pressure or causes harm in these
patients is limited.

 hallow respirations or respiratory rate <8 breaths/minb
S
Pinpoint pupils
Unresponsive to physical stimulation

1.	Stop opioid administration (as well as other sedative drugs), assess ABCs
(Airway, Breathing, Circulation), and call for help.
2.	Dilute naloxone:
a.	
If child >40 kg: Mix 0.4 mg (1 ampule) of naloxone with 9 mL of normal
saline (final concentration 0.04 mg/mL = 40 mCg/mL)
b.	
If child <40 kg: Mix 0.4 mg (1 ampule) of naloxone with 9 mL of normal
saline to make a concentration of 40 mCg/mL (as above). Then, repeat
dilution by mixing 1 mL of the 40 mCg/mL solution with 9 mL of normal
saline for final concentration of 4 mCg/mL.
3.	Administer and observe response: Administer dilute naloxone slowly (1–2 mCg/
kg/dose IV over 2 minutes). Observe patient response.
4.	Titrate to effect: Within 1–2 minutes, patient should open eyes and respond.
If not, continue until a total dose of 10 mCg/kg is given. If no response is
obtained, evaluate for other cause of sedation/respiratory depression.
5.	Discontinue naloxone administration: Discontinue naloxone as soon as patient
responds (e.g., takes deep breaths when directed).
6.	Caution: Another dose of naloxone may be required within 30 min of first dose
(duration of action of naloxone is shorter than that of most opioids).
7.	Monitor patient: Assign a staff member to monitor sedation/respiratory status
and remind patient to take deep breaths as necessary.
8.	Alternative analgesia: Provide nonopioids for pain relief. Resume opioid
administration at half the original dose when the patient is easily aroused, and
respiratory rate is >9 breaths/min.
aNaloxone administration for patients being treated for pain. Higher doses may be necessary for

patients found in the community or those with signs of cardiopulmonary failure. Please see formulary for additional dosing.
bRespiratory rates that require naloxone vary according to infant’s/child’s usual rate.

I. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A. Heart Rate
Refer to the inside front cover for normal heart rate (HR) by age.
B. Blood Pressure
1.	Blood pressure (BP):
See Tables 7.1 and 7.2 for normal BP values (systolic blood pressure
[SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) by age.1,2
2.	Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
a.	MAP = diastolic pressure + (pulse pressure/3) OR 1/3 systolic
­pressure + 2/3 diastolic pressure.
b.	Preterm infants and newborns: Normal MAP = gestational age in
weeks + 5.
3.	Abnormalities in BP
a.	Four-­limb BP measurements can be used to assess for coarctation of
the aorta.
b.	Pulsus paradoxus: Exaggeration of the normal drop in SBP with
inspiration. Determine SBP at the end of exhalation and during
inhalation; difference >10 mmHg consider pericardial effusion, tamponade, pericarditis, severe asthma, or restrictive cardiomyopathies.
4.	Hypertension (HTN)
a.	See Chapter 1 for management of acute HTN.
b.	See Chapter 19 for screening, work-­up, and management of chronic
HTN.
C. Heart Sounds
1.	S1: Associated with closure of mitral and tricuspid valves; heard best at
the apex or left lower sternal border (LLSB).
2.	S2: Associated with closure of pulmonary and aortic valves; heard best
at the left upper sternal border (LUSB) and has normal physiologic splitting that increases with inspiration.
3.	S3: Heard best at the apex or LLSB.
4.	S4: Heard at the apex.

ventricles (e.g., large VSD, CHF)
S4: Always pathologic, indicative of decreased ventricular compliance
Ejection click: Heard with stenosis of the semilunar valves, dilated great arteries in the setting of pulmonary or systemic HTN, idiopathic dilation of the PA,
TOF, persistent truncus arteriosus
Midsystolic click: Heard at the apex in mitral valve prolapse
Diastolic opening snap: Rare in children; associated with TS/MS

1.	Grading of heart murmurs: Intensified by states of higher cardiac output
(e.g., anemia, anxiety, fever, exercise).3
a.	Grade I: Barely audible
b.	Grade II: Murmur softer than heart sounds, but audible
c.	Grade III: Murmur moderately loud, equally loud as heart sounds,
not accompanied by a thrill
d.	Grade IV: Murmur louder than heart sounds, associated with a thrill
e.	Grade V: Audible with a stethoscope barely on the chest
f.	Grade VI: Audible with a stethoscope off the chest
2.	Benign heart murmurs4:
a.	Caused by a disturbance of the laminar flow of blood; frequently produced
as the diameter of the blood’s pathway decreases and velocity increases.
b.	Present in >80% of children sometime during childhood, most commonly beginning at age 3 to 4 years.
c.	Accentuated in high-­output states, especially with fever and anemia.
d.	Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and radiographic findings.
NOTE: ECG and chest radiograph are not routinely used, nor are they
cost-­effective screening tools for distinguishing benign from pathologic
murmurs.

3.	A murmur is more likely to be pathologic when one or more of the following are present: Symptoms (e.g., chest pain, dyspnea with exertion, syncope with exertion); cyanosis; a systolic murmur that is loud
(grade ≥3/6), harsh, pansystolic, or long in duration; diastolic murmur;
abnormal heart sounds; presence of a click; abnormally strong or weak
pulses.3,4
4.	Systolic and diastolic heart murmurs (Box 7.2).

(1)	Standardization: Paper speed is 25 mm/sec. One small square
= 1 mm = 0.04 second. One large square = 5 mm = 0.2 second.
Amplitude standard: 10 mm = 1 mV.
(2)	Calculation: HR (beats/min) = 60 divided by the average R-­R interval in seconds, or 1500 divided by the R-­R interval in millimeters.
b.	Rhythm
(1)	Sinus rhythm: Every QRS complex is preceded by a P wave,
normal PR interval (although PR interval may be prolonged, as in
first-­degree atrioventricular [AV] block), and normal P-­wave axis
(upright P in leads I and aVF).

(2)	There is normal respiratory variation of the R-­R interval without
morphologic changes of the P wave or QRS complex.
c.	Axis: The direction of the QRS in leads I and aVF should be
observed, the quadrant determined, and comparison made with age-­
matched normal values (Fig. 7.2 and Table 7.4).
d.	Intervals (PR, QRS, QTc)
(1)	See Table 7.4 for normal PR and QRS intervals.
(2)	The QTc is calculated using the Bazett formula: QTc = QT (sec)
measured/√R-­R (the average of three measurements taken from
the same lead, usually lead II).
(3)	The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Divide this value by the square
root of the preceding R-­R interval to obtain the QTc.
(4)	
Normal values for QTc are:
(a)	0.44 second is the 97th percentile for infants 3 to 4 days old.6
(b)	≤0.45 second in all males aged >1 week and in prepubescent females.
(c)	≤0.46 second for postpubescent females.
e.	P-­wave size and shape: A normal P wave should be <0.10 second in
children and <0.08 second in infants, with an amplitude of <0.3 mV
(3 mm in height, with normal standardization).
f.	R-­wave progression: In general, there is a normal increase in R-­wave
size and a decrease in S-­wave size from leads V1 to V6 (with dominant S
waves in the right precordial leads and dominant R waves in the left precordial leads), representing dominance of left ventricular forces. However,
newborns and infants have a normal dominance of the right ventricle.
g.	Q waves: Normal Q waves are usually <0.04 second in duration and
<25% of the total QRS amplitude. Q waves are <5 mm deep in the
left precordial leads and aVF, and ≤8 mm deep in lead III for children
age <3 years.

Practitioners. 5th ed. St Louis: Elsevier; 2008:53.)

i.	T wave:
(1)	Inverted T waves in V1 and V2 can be normal in children up to
adolescence (Table 7.5).
(2)	Tall, peaked T waves may be seen in hyperkalemia.
(3)	Flat or low T waves may be seen in hypokalemia, hypothyroidism, normal newborns, and myocardial/pericardial ischemia and
inflammation.
j.	Hypertrophy/enlargement
(1)	Atrial enlargement (Fig. 7.4).
(2)	Ventricular hypertrophy: Diagnosed by QRS axis, voltage, and
R/S ratio (Box 7.3; see also Table 7.6).
B. ECG Abnormalities
1.	Nonventricular arrhythmias (Table 7.6; Fig. 7.5)7
2.	Ventricular arrhythmias (Table 7.7; Fig. 7.6)
3.	Nonventricular conduction disturbances (Table 7.8; Fig. 7.7)8
4.	Ventricular conduction disturbances (Table 7.9)

Chapter 7 Cardiology  163
BOX 7.3
VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY CRITERIA
Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) Criteria
Must Have at Least One of the Following:
Upright T wave in lead V1 after 3 days of age to adolescence
Presence of Q wave in V1 (QR or QRS pattern)
Increased right and anterior QRS voltage (with normal QRS duration):
R in lead V1, >98th percentile for age
S in lead V6, >98th percentile for age
Right ventricular strain (associated with inverted T wave in V1 with tall R wave)
Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) Criteria
Left ventricular strain (associated with inverted T wave in leads V6, I, and/or aVF)
Left axis deviation (LAD) for patient’s age
Volume overload (associated with Q wave >5 mm and tall T waves in V5 or V6)
Increased QRS voltage in left leads (with normal QRS duration):
R in lead V6 (and I, aVL, V5), >98th percentile for age
S in lead V1, >98th percentile for age

C. ECG Findings Secondary to Electrolyte Disturbances, Medications,
and Systemic Illnesses (Table 7.10)7,9
D. Long QT
1.	Diagnosis:
a.	In general, QTc is similar in males and females from birth until late
adolescence (0.37 to 0.44 second).
b.	In adults, prolonged QTc is generally >0.45 second.
c.	In ∼10% of cases, patients may have a normal QTc. Patients may
also have a family history of long QT associated with unexplained
syncope, seizure, or cardiac arrest, without prolongation of QTc on
ECG.
d.	Treadmill exercise testing may prolong the QTc and will sometimes
induce arrhythmias.
2.	Complications: Associated with ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de
pointes), syncope, and sudden death.
3.	Management:
a.	Congenital long QT: β-­blockers and/or defibrillators; rarely requires
cardiac sympathetic denervation or cardiac pacemakers.
b.	Acquired long QT: Treatment of arrhythmias, discontinuation of
precipitating drugs, and correction of metabolic abnormalities.
E. Hyperkalemia:
ECG changes dependent on the serum potassium (K+) level; however, the
ECG may be normal with serum K+ levels between 2.5 and 6 mEq/L.
1.	Serum K+ <2.5 mEq/L: Depressed ST segment, biphasic T wave.
2.	Serum K+ >6 mEq/L: Tall T wave.

Cause

Treatment

Most commonly idiopathic but may be seen in
congenital heart disease (e.g., Ebstein anomaly,
transposition)

Vagal maneuvers, adenosine; if unstable, need
immediate synchronized cardioversion (0.5 J/kg up
to 1 J/kg); consult cardiologist; refer to the back of
the book for tachycardia with poor perfusion and
tachycardia with adequate perfusion algorithms

I.	AV Reentrant: Presence of accessory bypass pathway, in conjunction
with AV node, establishes cyclic pattern of reentry independent of SA
node; most common cause of non-­sinus tachycardia in children (see
Wolff-­Parkinson-­White syndrome, Table 7.9)
II.	Junctional: Automatic focus; simultaneous depolarization of atria
Cardiac surgery, idiopathic
and ventricles yields invisible P wave or retrograde P wave
III.	Ectopic atrial tachycardia: Rapid firing of ectopic focus in atrium
Idiopathic
NODAL ESCAPE/JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM

10 minutes, and the ABG is repeated. In cardiac disease, there will not be
a significant change in Pao2 following the oxygen challenge test. A Pao2 of
>200 after exposure to Fio2 of 1.0 is considered normal, and >150 indicates pulmonary rather than cardiac disease. Note: Pulse oximetry is not
useful for following changes in oxygenation once saturation has reached
100% (approximately a Pao2 of >90 mmHg).12–17 See Table EC 7.A for
interpretation of oxygen challenge test (hyperoxia test).

IV. ACQUIRED HEART DISEASE
A. Myocardial Infarction (MI) in Children (Box 7.4; Fig. 7.8)
B. Endocarditis
1.	Common causative organisms: Approximately 70% of endocarditis is caused by streptococcal species (Streptococcus viridans,
enterococci), 20% by staphylococcal species (Staphylococcus
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), and 10% by other organisms
(Haemophilus influenzae, gram-­negative bacteria, fungi).
2.	Presentation: Heart murmur, recurrent fever, splenomegaly, petechiae,
fatigue, Osler nodes (tender nodules at the fingertips), Janeway lesions
(painless hemorrhagic areas on the palms or soles), splinter hemorrhages, Roth spots (retinal hemorrhages).
3.	Diagnosis—Duke’s Criteria:
a.	Pathologic criteria:
(1)	Direct evidence of endocarditis based upon histologic findings.
(2)	Gram stain positive or cultures of specimens.
b.	Clinical criteria: 1 major criterion and 1 minor OR 3 minor criteria:
(1)	Major: Persistently positive blood cultures (2 sets 1 hour apart),
positive echocardiogram for vegetations, new regurgitant murmur, single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii.
(2)	Minor: Fever, predisposing valvular condition (prosthetic heart
valve, valve lesion OR intravenous drug user [IVDU]), vascular
phenomenon (e.g., emboli), immunologic phenomenon (e.g.,
Roth’s spots, Osler’s nodes), positive blood cultures that do not
meet major criteria.
4.	Management: Daily blood cultures while febrile; support heart failure
symptoms with diuretics, digoxin, etc.
C. Bacterial Endocarditis Prophylaxis
See Box 7.5 for cardiac conditions that meet criteria for prophylaxis.18
1.	All dental procedures that involve treatment of gingival tissue, the periapical region of the teeth, or oral mucosal perforation.
2.	Invasive procedures that involve incision or biopsy of respiratory
mucosa, such as tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
3.	Not recommended for genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedures;
solely for bacterial endocarditis prevention.
4.	Treatment: Amoxicillin is preferred PO; ampicillin if unable to take PO;
cephalexin if allergic to penicillins.28

D. Myocardial Disease
1.	Dilated cardiomyopathy: End result of myocardial damage leading to
atrial and ventricular dilation with decreased systolic contractile function
of the ventricles.
a.	Treatment: Management of congestive heart failure (CHF) (digoxin,
diuretics, vasodilation, angiotensin-­converting enzyme [ACE]
inhibitors).
b.	Anticoagulants should be considered to decrease the risk of thrombus formation. Cardiac transplant may eventually be required.

CARDIAC CONDITIONS FOR WHICH ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IS
RECOMMENDED
•
•
•

 rosthetic cardiac valve
P
Previous bacterial endocarditis
Congenital heart disease (CHD)—Limited to the following conditions:
• Unrepaired cyanotic defect, including palliative shunts and conduits
• Completely repaired CHD with prosthetic material/device (placed by
surgery or catheterization), during first 6 months after procedure
• Repaired CHD with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of prosthetic
patch or device (which inhibits endothelialization)
• Cardiac transplantation patients who develop cardiac valvulopathy

Data from Wilson W, Taubert KA, Gewitz M, et al. Prevention of infective endocarditis: Guidelines
from the American Heart Association: A guideline from the American Heart Association Rheumatic
Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the
Young, and the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia,
and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group. Circulation.
2007;116(15):1736–1754.

2.	Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM): Abnormality of
myocardial cells leading to significant ventricular hypertrophy (usually
left ventricle) with small to normal ventricular dimensions. Increased
contractile function, impaired filling secondary to stiff ventricles. Most
common type is asymmetrical septal hypertrophy with (HOCM) or without left ventricular outflow obstruction. There is a 4% to 6% incidence
of sudden death in children and adolescents.
a.	Treatment: Moderate restriction of physical activity, negative inotropes (β-­blocker, calcium channel blocker) to help improve filling, and
maintenance of adequate hydration. If at increased risk for sudden
death, may consider implantable defibrillator. If symptomatic with
subaortic obstruction, may benefit from myectomy.
b.	Additional management: HOCM is a preload dependent lesion and,
therefore, patient may benefit from higher rates of fluid administration. Avoid inotropes, tachycardia, and afterload reduction.
3.	Restrictive cardiomyopathy: Myocardial or endocardial disease (usually
infiltrative or fibrotic) resulting in stiff ventricular walls with restriction of diastolic filling but normal contractile function. Results in atrial
enlargement. Associated with a high mortality rate. Very rare in children.
Treatment is supportive with diuretics, anticoagulants, calcium channel
blockers, a pacemaker for heart block, and cardiac transplantation, if
severe.
4.	Myocarditis: Inflammation of myocardial tissue
a.	Etiology:
(1)	Infectious: viral (coxsackie virus, echovirus, adenovirus), bacterial, rickettsial, fungal, parasitic
(2)	Other: immune-­mediated disease (Kawasaki disease, acute
rheumatic fever), collagen vascular disease, toxin-­induced

b.	Presentation: Symptoms can be nonspecific, including fatigue, shortness of breath, emesis. Exam includes signs of CHF, soft systolic
murmur, arrhythmia.
c.	Testing:
(1)	Imaging: ECG: Low QRS voltages throughout (<5 mm), ST-­
segment and T-­wave changes (e.g., decreased T-­wave amplitude), prolongation of QT interval, arrhythmias (especially
premature contractions, first-­or second-­degree AV block); echo
shows enlarged chambers and impaired LV function
(2)	Labs: CK, troponin
d.	Treatment: Bed rest, diuretics, inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine,
milrinone), digoxin, gamma globulin, ACE inhibitors, possibly
steroids.
e.	May require ventricular assist device and/or heart transplantation
(≈20% to 25% of cases).
E. Pericardial Disease
1.	Pericarditis: Inflammation of visceral and parietal layers of pericardium.
It is often self-­limited.
a.	Presentation: Chest pain (often pleuritic in nature), fever, tachycardia, distant heart sounds, friction rub.
b.	EKG: Diffuse ST-­segment elevation in almost all leads (representing
inflammation of adjacent myocardium); PR-­segment depression.
c.	Treatment: Address underlying condition and provide symptomatic
treatment with rest, analgesia, and anti-­inflammatory drugs.
2.	Pericardial effusion: Accumulation of excess fluid in pericardial sac.
a.	Etiology: Acute pericarditis, serous effusion from increased hydrostatic pressure (CHF), decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased
capillary permeability.
b.	Presentation: Can be asymptomatic, chest or abdominal pain,
muffled heart sounds, dullness to percussion, vital sign instability
from cardiac compression (e.g., hypotension).
c.	EKG: Decreased QRS voltage, electrical alternans.
d.	Treatment: Address underlying condition. Observe if asymptomatic; use pericardiocentesis if there is sudden increase in volume
or hemodynamic compromise. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids may be of benefit, depending on
etiology.
3.	Cardiac tamponade: Accumulation of pericardial fluid under high pressure causing compression of cardiac chambers, limiting filling, and
decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output.
a.	Etiology: Same as pericardial effusion.
b.	Presentation: Dyspnea, fatigue, signs of CHF (jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, edema, tachypnea/rales), pulsus paradoxus.
c.	EKG: Same as pericardial effusion.
d.	Echocardiogram: RV collapse in early diastole, RA/LA collapse in end
diastole and early systole.

e.	Treatment is pericardiocentesis with temporary catheter left in place
if necessary; pericardial window or stripping, if it is a recurrent
condition.
F. Kawasaki Disease19
Acute febrile vasculitis of unknown etiology, which is common in children
aged <8 years and is the leading cause of acquired childhood heart disease in developed countries.
1.	Etiology: Unknown; thought to be immune regulated in response to
infectious agents or environmental toxins.
2.	Diagnosis:
a.	Typical Kawasaki disease: Based on clinical criteria. These include
high fever lasting 5 days or more, plus at least four of the following
five criteria:
(1)	Bilateral, painless, bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate
(2)	Erythematous mouth and pharynx, strawberry tongue, or red
cracked lips
(3)	Polymorphous exanthem (may be morbilliform, maculopapular,
or scarlatiniform)
(4)	Swelling of hands and feet with erythema of palms and soles
(5)	Cervical lymphadenopathy (>1.5 cm in diameter), usually single
and unilateral
b.	Atypical/incomplete Kawasaki disease: A suspicion of Kawasaki
disease but with fewer of the criteria required for diagnosis. Even
without all criteria, there is a risk for coronary artery abnormalities.
(1)	More often seen in infants. Echocardiography should be considered in any infant <6 months with fever >7 days duration,
laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (CRP >3 and/or
ESR >40), and no other explanation for the febrile illness.
(2)	See Fig. 7.9 for evaluation of incomplete Kawasaki disease.
(3)	Supplemental laboratory criteria: Albumin ≤3.0 g/dL, anemia
for age, elevation of alanine aminotransferase, platelets after 7
days ≥450,000/mm3, white blood cell count ≥15,000/mm3,
and urine white blood cells/hpf ≥10 (non-­catheterized
specimen).
3.	Other clinical findings: Often associated with extreme irritability, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting. Also seen are arthritis and arthralgia,
hepatic enlargement, jaundice, acute acalculous distention of the
gallbladder, carditis.
4.	Laboratory findings: Leukocytosis with left shift, neutrophils with vacuoles or toxic granules, elevated C-­reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) (seen acutely), thrombocytosis, normocytic
and normochromic anemia, sterile pyuria (33%), increased transaminases (40%), hyperbilirubinemia (10%).
5.	Subacute phase (11 to 25 days after onset of illness): Resolution
of fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Often, desquamation of
the fingertips or toes and thrombocytosis occur. Cardiovascular

Chapter 7 Cardiology  181
complications: If untreated, 20% to 25% develop coronary artery
aneurysms and dilation in subacute phase (peak prevalence occurs
about 2 to 4 weeks after onset of disease; rarely appears after 6
weeks) and are at risk for coronary thrombosis acutely and coronary
stenosis chronically. Carditis; aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation; pericardial effusion; CHF; MI; left ventricular dysfunction; and
ECG changes may also occur.
6.	Convalescent phase: ESR, CRP, and platelet count return to normal.
Those with coronary artery abnormalities are at increased risk for MI,
arrhythmias, and sudden death.
7.	Management (see also Table EC 7.B)19

182  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
a.	Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
(1)	Shown to reduce incidence of coronary artery dilation to <3%
and decrease duration of fever, if given in the first 10 days of
illness. Current recommended regimen is a single dose of IVIG,
2 g/kg over 10 to 12 hours.19
(2)	Can be given to children after 10th day of fever if ESR or CRP
elevated with persistent fever.
(3)	Approximately 10% of patients treated with IVIG fail to respond
(persistent or recurrent fever ≥36 hours after IVIG completion).
Retreat with second dose.19
b.	Aspirin is recommended for both its anti-­inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. In the United States, high-­dose aspirin (80 to 100 mg/
kg/day divided in four doses) is recommended 48 to 72 hours after
defervescence. This is given with IVIG. Low-­dose aspirin (3 to 5 mg/
kg/day as a single daily dose) is continued for 6 to 8 weeks or until
platelet count and ESR are normal (if there are no coronary artery
abnormalities). Aspirin may be continued indefinitely, if coronary
artery abnormalities persist.19
c.	Dipyridamole is sometimes used as an alternative to aspirin, particularly if symptoms of influenza or varicella arise while on aspirin (due
to concern for Reye syndrome).
d.	Follow-­up: Serial echocardiography is recommended to assess coronary
arteries and left ventricular function (at time of diagnosis, at 2 weeks,
at 6 to 8 weeks, and at 12 months [optional]). More frequent intervals
and long-­term follow-­up are recommended if abnormalities are seen on
echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization may be necessary.
e.	Follow up with Cardiology depending on presence of coronary aneurysms and Z score of aneurysm (see Table EC 7.B).
G. Rheumatic Heart Disease
1.	Etiology: Believed to be an immunologically-mediated, delayed sequela
of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
2.	Clinical findings: History of streptococcal pharyngitis 1 to 5 weeks
before onset of symptoms. Often with pallor, malaise, easy fatigability.
3.	Diagnosis: Jones criteria (Box 7.6).
4.	Management: Penicillin, bed rest, salicylates, supportive management of
CHF (if present) with diuretics, digoxin, morphine.

B. Goals for Lipid Levels in Childhood23
1.	Total cholesterol
a.	Acceptable (<170 mg/dL): Repeat measurement in 3 to 5 years.
b.	Borderline (170 to 199 mg/dL): Repeat cholesterol and average with
previous measurement. If <170 mg/dL, repeat in 3 to 5 years. If ≥
170 mg/dL, obtain lipoprotein analysis.
c.	High (≥200 mg/dL): Obtain lipoprotein analysis.
2.	Low-­density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
a.	Acceptable (<110 mg/dL)
b.	Borderline (110 to 129 mg/dL)
c.	High (≥130 mg/dL)

X. CARDIOVASCULAR SCREENING
A. Sports24
There is no established or mandated pre-­participation sports screening.
There is a recommended history and physical examination screening from
the AHA.24 Routine ECGs are not required unless there is suspicion of
underlying cardiac disease Box EC 7.A).
B. Attention–Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)27
1.	Obtain a good patient and family history as well as physical examination.
2.	There is no increased risk of sudden cardiac death in children without
cardiac disease taking ADHD medications. There is no consensus on
universal ECG screening. ECGs should be obtained in those who screen
with positive answers on history, in cases of polypharmacy, in those
with tachycardia while on medications, and in those with a history of
significant cardiac disease. If a patient has significant heart disease
or concern for cardiac disease, have patient evaluated by a pediatric
cardiologist.

II. VASCULAR ANOMALIES1
A. Vascular Tumors
1.	Infantile hemangiomas (Fig. 8.1, Color Plates).2,3
a.	Pathogenesis: Benign vascular tumor with rapid proliferation followed
by spontaneous involution. Most present before 4 weeks of age.
Undergo rapid growth between 1 and 2 months of age, with 80% of
size reached by 3 months. Most begin to regress between 6 and 12
months of age, with the majority of tumor regression occurring by 4
years of age. 50% to 70% resolve completely.
b.	Clinical presentation: Newborns may demonstrate pale macules with
threadlike telangiectasias that later develop into hemangiomas. May
be superficial, deep, or mixed. After involution, can have residual
skin changes including scarring and atrophy.
c.	Indicators that should prompt consideration for early treatment:
(1) Potential for life-­threatening complications: Airway hemangiomas,
liver hemangiomas (associated with high-­output heart failure and
severe hypothyroidism), and profuse bleeding from an ulcerated
hemangioma.
(2) Risk of functional impairment: Interference with the development of vision (if near eye) and interference with feeding (if near
mouth).
(3) Ulceration: Most common complication (5% to 21%). Can
be extremely painful and usually scars; risk greatest in large
hemangiomas and those located in skin creases, particularly the
diaper area.
(4) Associated structural anomalies: PHACES syndrome
(Posterior cranial fossa malformations, large segmental facial
Hemangiomas, Arterial lesions, Cardiovascular anomalies (aortic
anomalies), Eye anomalies, Sternal cleft anomalies/supraumbilical raphes4) and LUMBAR syndrome (Lower body hemangioma,
Urogenital anomalies, Ulceration, Myelopathy, Bony deformities,
Anorectal malformations, Arterial anomalies, Renal anomalies).
(5) Potential for disfigurement: Risk of permanent scarring or distortion of anatomic landmarks.

TABLE 8.1
INDICATIONS TO OBTAIN IMAGING OF INFANTILE HEMANGIOMAS
Indication

Imaging Modality

1.	Diagnosis of infantile hemangiomas
(IH) is uncertain (e.g., atypical
appearance or behavior)
2.	Five or more cutaneous IH

Ultrasound with Doppler

3.	Associated structural abnormalities
(e.g., PHACE syndrome or LUMBAR
syndrome) are suspected

1.	If PHACE syndrome is suspected, MRI/MRA head/
neck with and without contrast; echocardiography
2.	If LUMBAR syndrome is suspected, spinal ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound with Doppler are
initial screen, with MRI likely to follow
3.	May wish to consult with hemangioma specialist
on exact imaging to be ordered

Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler (screen for hepatic
IH)

d.	Diagnosis: Usually diagnosed clinically. Atypical clinical findings,
growth pattern, and equivocal imaging should prompt tissue biopsy
to exclude other neoplasms or unusual vascular malformations. See
Table 8.1 for indications to order imaging.
e.	Treatment:
(1) Most are uncomplicated and can be observed with watchful
waiting. Photo documentation is used to follow the growth and
regression process.
(2)	If an infantile hemangioma is identified as high risk, the child
should be evaluated by a hemangioma specialist promptly, as
there is a narrow window of opportunity in which to intervene
and prevent poor outcomes.
(3)	β-­adrenergic blockers such as propranolol are considered first-­line
therapy for complicated infantile hemangiomas and should be
initiated under supervision of a pediatric dermatologist or experienced practitioner.5 While patients should be clinically screened
for cardiac disease, EKG and/or echocardiogram are not required
unless there is clinical concern. Contraindications include:
Reactive airways, sinus bradycardia, decompensated heart failure,
greater than 1st degree heart block, hypotension, hypoglycemia,
hypersensitivity to propranolol. Off label use of selective beta-­
blockers may be considered in certain patients. Duration should
be at least 6 months and up to 12 months of age.6
(4)	Corticosteroids are considered second line. Similar efficacy to
propranolol in a prospective, randomized, investigator-­blinded
trial, but propranolol is better tolerated and with fewer severe
side effects.7
(5)	Topical timolol is effective in superficial, uncomplicated hemangiomas (recommend 0.5% gel forming solution).

192  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
2.	Pyogenic granuloma (Lobular Capillary Hemangioma) (Fig. 8.2, Color
Plates)
a.	Clinical presentation: Benign vascular tumor, appears as small (usually 3 to 10 mm but occasionally much larger) bright red papule that
grows over several weeks to months into sessile or pedunculated
papule with a “collarette,” scale, or crust. Can bleed profusely with
minor trauma and can ulcerate. Rarely spontaneously regresses.
Seen in all ages; average age of diagnosis 6 months to 10 years.
Located on head and neck, sometimes in oral mucosa but can be at
any skin site and often misdiagnosed as hemangiomas.
b.	Treatment: Usually required, given frequent bleeding and ulceration.
Options include shave excision or curettage with cautery of base,
surgical excision, carbon dioxide laser excision, or pulsed dye laser
therapy. For most cases, shave and cautery are quick, safe, low risk,
and can be performed quickly with local anesthesia.
B. Vascular Malformations
Include capillary (port-­wine stains and salmon patch/stork bite/angel kiss),
lymphatic, venous, and arteriovenous malformations.
Note: For a comparison of vascular malformations to vascular tumors,
please see Table EC 8.A.8

III. INFECTIONS
A. Viral
1.	Warts
a.	Pathogenesis: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) of the epithelium or
mucus membrane.
b.	Clinical presentation:
(1) Common warts: Skin-­colored, rough, minimally scaly papules
and nodules found most commonly on the hands, although
can occur anywhere. Can be solitary or multiple, range from a
few millimeters to several centimeters, may form large plaques
or a confluent linear pattern secondary to autoinoculation.
Sometimes persistent in immunocompromised patients.
(2) Flat warts: Flesh to brown/yellow-­colored, smooth, flat-­topped
papules commonly found over the hands, arms, and face.
Usually <2 mm in diameter and often present in clusters.
(3) Plantar warts: Occur on soles of feet as inward growing,
hyperkeratotic plaques and papules. Trauma on weight-­bearing
surfaces results in small black dots (petechiae from thrombosed
vessels on the surface of the wart). Can be painful.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
d.	Treatment9:
(1)	Spontaneous resolution occurs in greater than 75% of warts in
otherwise healthy individuals within 3 years. No specific treatment
clearly better than placebo, except possibly topical salicylic acid.

(2) Keratolytics (topical salicylates): Particularly effective in combination with adhesive tape occlusion. Response may take 4 to 6
months.
(3) Destructive techniques, candida antigen, cantharidin, or “beetle
juice” are not clearly more effective than placebo. Additionally,
destructive techniques can be painful and cause scarring. These
options are not recommended in children.
2.	Molluscum contagiosum (Fig. 8.3, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Large DNA poxvirus. Spread by skin-­to-­skin contact.
b.	Clinical presentation: Dome-­shaped, often umbilicated, translucent to white papules that range from 1 mm to 1 cm. Occur
anywhere except palms and soles, most commonly on the trunk
and intertriginous areas. Can occur in the genital area and lower
abdomen when obtained as a sexually transmitted infection.
May be pruritic and can be surrounded by erythema, resembling
eczema.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
d.	Treatment: Most spontaneously resolve within 6 to 18 months and do
not require intervention other than monitoring for secondary bacterial
infection. Surrounding eczematous changes may indicate an immunologic reaction and serve as a harbinger of regression. Treatment
may cause scarring and may not be more effective than placebo.
Recurrences are common.
3.	Herpes simplex virus
a.	Pathogenesis: Either HSV-­1 or HSV-­2 may be implicated, regardless
of lesion location. During the initial outbreak, oral lesions last 2 to
3 weeks whereas genital lesions may last 2 to 6 weeks. Recurrent
episodes are usually much shorter.
b.	Clinical presentation (Fig. 8.6, Color Plate): Symptoms include
prodrome of tingling, itching, or burning followed by painful vesicles
on erythematous base that may last 7 to 10 days, break open, and
crust prior to healing, flu-­like symptoms, dehydration (gingivostomatitis), dysuria (genital), ophthalmologic symptoms (keratitis). May be
triggered by stress, illness, sun exposure, and menstruation. The first
outbreak is typically the worst.
c.	Diagnosis: Diagnosed clinically and, in many centers, with viral DNA
PCR (more sensitive than culture). To culture a lesion, clean with
alcohol, un-­roof lesion with sterile needle or wooden side of cotton
swab, collect vesicular fluid on sterile swab, and send in viral transport medium.
d.	Treatment: Acyclovir or valacyclovir for 7 to 14 days (see Formulary
for dosing). For children with herpetic gingivostomatitis, antiviral
therapy should be initiated within 72 to 96 hours of onset if they
are unable to drink or have significant pain. Valacyclovir is generally
preferred as it is more bioavailable than acyclovir and, as a result, is
dosed less frequently.

Chapter 8 Dermatology  193

194  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
4.	Erythema infectiosum (“fifth disease”)
a.	Pathogenesis: Parvovirus B19.
b.	Clinical presentation: Pediatric presentation of nonspecific febrile
illness with headache, coryza, and gastrointestinal complaints. Two
to five days after onset of symptoms, the classic malar rash with
“slapped cheek” appearance erupts, followed by a reticular rash to
the trunk several days later. Associated signs and symptoms include
arthralgias (more common in adults) and a transient aplastic crisis,
which may be more of a problem in patients with hemoglobinopathies and pregnant women.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis, serum IgM, or serum DNA PCR.
d.	Treatment: Supportive care and avoiding contact with pregnant
women.
5.	Pityriasis rosea
a.	Pathogenesis: Viral etiology (possibly HHV-6, HHV-7) has been
hypothesized but no definitive cause has been described.
b.	Clinical presentation: Typically asymptomatic or may have mild pruritus. Classic presentation with a round to oval, sharply demarcated,
scaly, salmon-­colored herald patch with central clearing on trunk
followed by a “Christmas tree” distribution of oval crops of lesions
similar to herald patch. Pediatric patients may have an atypical distribution involving the scalp, face, distal extremities, and sparing of the
trunk. Lesions typically resolve in 4 to 6 weeks.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
d.	Treatment: Typically self-­resolving.
6.	Roseola infantum (Fig. 8.5, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-­6).
b.	Clinical presentation: Typically diagnosed in children <2 years old
with peak 7 to 13 months. Febrile phase of 3 to 5 days of high fever
(often >40°C), viremia, and irritability. As febrile phase resolves,
patients develop a morbilliform rash on neck and trunk that spreads
centripetally to face and extremities for 1 to 2 days.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
d.	Treatment: Self-­resolving.
7.	Hand, foot, and mouth disease
a.	Pathogenesis: Most commonly Coxsackievirus A serotypes.
b.	Clinical presentation: Oral lesions on the tongue, buccal mucosa, and
palate that initially are 1 to 5 mm erythematous macules and evolve
to vesicles and ulcers with a thin erythematous halo. Erythematous,
non-­pruritic 1 to 10 mm macules, papules, and/or vesicles on the
palms and soles. Typically resolve in 3 to 4 days. Usually nontender, unless caused by Coxsackie A6 (associated with high fevers,
widespread lesions, longer duration [12 days], palmar and plantar
desquamation, and nail dystrophy).
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
d.	Treatment: Supportive care.

8.	Reactive erythema (Fig. 8.4; Figs. 8.5–8.10, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Represent cutaneous reaction patterns triggered by
endogenous and environmental factors (e.g., viral infections, drug
reactions).
b.	Clinical presentation: Group of disorders characterized by erythematous patches, plaques, and nodules that vary in size, shape, and
distribution.
B. Parasitic
1.	Scabies (Fig. 8.11, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Spread by skin-­
to-­skin contact and through fomites. Can live for 2 days away from a
human host. Female mites burrow and lay eggs under the skin.
b.	Clinical presentation: Initial lesion is a small, erythematous papule
that is easy to overlook. Can have burrows (elongated, edematous
papulovesicles, often with a pustule at the advancing border) which
are pathognomonic. Most commonly located in interdigital webs,
wrist folds, elbows, axilla, genitals, buttocks, and belt line. In temperate climates, the face and scalp are usually spared. In young infants,
the palms and soles are also commonly involved. Burrows are
most dramatic in patients who are unable to scratch (e.g., infants).
Disseminated eczematous eruption results in generalized severe
pruritus, especially at night. Can become nodular, particularly in
intertriginous areas, or be susceptible to superinfection due to frequent excoriations. Immunosuppressed patients may develop diffuse
scaly crusted eruption and lack pruritus.
c.	Treatment10:
(1) Permethrin cream: 5% cream applied to skin from neck down in
normal hosts including under fingernails and toenails. Rinse off
after 8 to 14 hours. Can repeat in 7 to 10 days.
(2) Ivermectin (off-­label use): Single dose; can repeat in 2 weeks.
Efficacy comparable to permethrin cream. May be the best
choice for immunodeficient patients where total body application
may be difficult.
(3) Environment: Mites cannot live away from human skin for more
than 2 to 3 days. Launder clothing and sheets. Bag and seal
stuffed animals and pillows for 2 to 3 days. Consider treatment
of close contacts.
C. Fungal (Figs. 8.12–8.16, Color Plates)
1.	Tinea capitis (see Fig. 8.12, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Mostly caused by fungi of the genus Trichophyton in
North America (95%), less commonly Microsporum (5% or less),
and spread through contact and fomites.
b.	Epidemiology: Usually occurs in young children, with higher incidence in African American children, but any age and ethnicity can
be affected.

Reactive erythema. (Modified from Cohen BA. Atlas of Pediatric Dermatology. 4th ed.
China: Elsevier Limited; 2013:206.)

c.	Clinical presentation:
(1) Black dot: Most common. Slowly growing, erythematous, scaling
patches. These areas develop alopecia and black dots are visible on scalp where hair has broken.
(2) Gray patch (“seborrheic dermatitis type”): Erythematous,
scaling, well-­demarcated patches that grow centrifugally. Hair
breaks off a few millimeters above the scalp and takes on a gray/
frosted appearance.
(3) Kerion (see Fig. 8.13, Color Plates): Complication of tinea capitis
or tinea corporis. Type IV hypersensitivity to fungus. Raised,
boggy/spongy lesions, often tender and covered with purulent
exudate. Most commonly occurs months after primary infection.
(4)	All can be associated with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.
d.	Diagnosis: Can be made clinically, but since oral antifungal therapy is
indicated, tinea capitis should be confirmed by direct microscopic exam
of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of the proximal ends of
hairs, gently and painlessly scraped from the affected area. Cultures
may be obtained by using a sterile toothbrush or cotton swab. The scale
can be scraped directly into a sterile plastic cup and/or the cotton swab
tips can be broken off and placed into the sterile plastic cups.
e.	Treatment11: Always requires systemic therapy. First-­line therapy
includes oral griseofulvin for 10 to 12 weeks (which should be taken
with fatty foods for improved absorption) and terbinafine for 6 weeks
(see Formulary for dosing). Most experts consider terbinafine superior to griseofulvin for T. tonsurans because of its shorter duration of
therapy and superior effectiveness. The FDA recommends baseline
and follow-­up hepatic function testing in children taking terbinafine,
though most clinicians forego laboratory testing in healthy children
without history of liver disease if treatment is 6 weeks or less. Though
not FDA-­approved for tinea capitis, fluconazole at 6 mg/kg/day (max
400 mg/day) for 6 weeks is recommended by the AAP Red Book as
an alternative treatment of tinea capitis in children younger than 2
years old.12 All family members, particularly other children, should
be examined carefully for subtle infection. Selenium sulfide 2.5%
shampoo may shorten the period of shedding of fungal organisms
and reduce risk of infection of unaffected family members.
2.	Tinea corporis and pedis11 (see Figs. 8.14 and 8.15, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Spread through direct contact and fomites, especially
in sports with close contact.
b.	Clinical presentation: Pruritic, erythematous, annular patch or plaque
with central clearing and a scaly raised border. Typically affects
glabrous skin (smooth and bare).
c.	Diagnosis: Usually diagnosed clinically, but a KOH preparation or
fungal culture can be used to help guide diagnosis.
d.	Treatment: Topical antifungals (terbinafine, azole) through 1 to 2
weeks past lesion resolution. Widespread eruption may require oral
antifungals.

8

Chapter 8 Dermatology  197

198  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Tinea versicolor (see Fig. 8.16, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Caused by Malassezia. Exacerbated by hot/humid
weather, hyperhidrosis, topical skin oil use. Most people are colonized with Malassezia but only a small number are prone to develop
clinical lesions. Not associated with poor hygiene. Not contagious.
b.	Clinical presentation: Well demarcated, minimally scaly, hypopigmented macules or patches. Hypopigmented areas tend to be more
prominent in the summer because affected areas do not tan. Lesions
often have a fine scale that may be noted following gentle rubbing
and can be mildly pruritic but are usually asymptomatic.
c.	Diagnosis: KOH microscopy reveals pseudohyphae and yeast cells
that appear like “spaghetti and meatballs.”
d.	Treatment: Topical antifungal shampoos and/or creams (miconazole,
oxiconazole, ketoconazole) or selenium sulfide are effective. Given the
risk of hepatotoxicity, oral azole antifungals are reserved for resistant
or widespread disease. Oral terbinafine is not effective. Pigmentation
changes may take months to resolve despite successful treatment.
D. Bacterial
1.	Impetigo
a.	Pathogenesis: Contagious bacterial infection of the skin, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (99% MSSA), with a minority of cases caused by Group A Streptococcus.
b.	Clinical presentation:
(1) Nonbullous impetigo: Papules that evolve into erythematous
pustules or vesicles that break and form thick, honey-­colored
crusts and plaques. Commonly overlying any break to skin barrier. Primarily face and extremities.
(2) Bullous impetigo: Painless vesicles that evolve into flaccid bullae
and crusted patches with undermined border. Seen more in
infants and young children. Caused by Staphylococcus aureus
exfoliative toxin A.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis.
d.	Treatment: When impetigo is contained to a small area, topical mupirocin may be used for 5 days. When the infection is widespread,
an oral antibiotic such as cephalexin should be used for 7 days.
Consider broader coverage if MRSA is suspected, although MSSA
accounts for most infections.
2.	Staph scalded skin syndrome
a.	Pathogenesis: Staphylococcus aureus infections of the skin with hematogenous dissemination of exfoliative toxin A or B to the epidermis.
b.	Clinical presentation: Typical presentation is Ritter disease (generalized exfoliation) in a 3-­to 7-­day-­old infant who initially is febrile and
irritable with conjunctivitis and perioral erythema. In addition to
newborns, this presentation is seen in young children who do not
have antibodies to the toxin and often do not clear the toxin-­antibody
complex quickly due to decreased renal excretion. One to two days
after the prodromal onset, patient develops diffuse erythema, fragile,

flaccid bullae and erosions that are Nikolsky positive in areas of
mechanical stress such as intertriginous areas. Lesions are not
scarring as they are intraepidermal. Older children tend to have a
localized bullous impetigo with tender scarlatiniform eruption. Infants
and toddlers usually have a combination of the presentations seen in
neonates and older children along with white to brown thick flaking
desquamation of the entire body, especially the face and neck.
c.	Diagnosis: Typically clinically. However, cultures should be obtained
from any potential source site of infection or colonization such as the
medial canthi or nares.
d.	Treatment: Nearly all cases are MSSA, with an increasing number
being clindamycin resistant. First-­line treatment may include oral
penicillinase-­resistant beta-­lactams such as first or second-­generation
cephalosporins. Vancomycin should be considered in patients who
fail to respond to treatment and/or in areas with a high prevalence of
MRSA. Management should also include supportive care with topical
emollients and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status.
3.	Scarlet fever (Fig. 8.17, Color Plates)
a.	Pathogenesis: Exotoxin-­mediated response to a Streptococcus pyogenes infection, typically pharyngitis.
b.	Clinical presentation: Sandpaper-­like, coarse, erythematous, blanching rash that originates in the groin and axilla then spreads to the
trunk then extremities but spares the palms and soles. May have
Pastia lines. Associated with pharyngitis, circumoral pallor, and a
strawberry tongue.
c.	Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis. May benefit from rapid strep test and
throat culture.
d.	Treatment: No additional treatment aside from treating the patient’s
Strep pharyngitis.
4.	Cellulitis: See Chapter 17.

IV. HAIR LOSS (FIGS. 8.18–8.20, COLOR PLATES)
A. Telogen Effluvium (see Fig. 8.18, Color Plates)
1.	Pathogenesis: Most common cause of diffuse hair loss. Mature hair
follicles switch prematurely to the telogen (resting) state, with shedding
within 3 months.
2.	Clinical presentation: Diffuse hair thinning 3 months after a stressful event (major illnesses or surgery, pregnancy, severe weight
loss).
3.	Treatment: Self-­limited. Regrowth usually occurs over several months.
B. Alopecia Areata (see Fig. 8.19, Color Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Chronic inflammatory (probably autoimmune)
disease that starts with well-­circumscribed small bald patches and
normal-­appearing underlying skin. New lesions may demonstrate subtle
erythema and be pruritic. Bald patches may enlarge to involve large
areas of the scalp or other hair-­bearing areas. Many experience good

8

Chapter 8 Dermatology  199

200  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
hair regrowth within 1 to 2 years, although most will relapse. A minority progress to total loss of all scalp (alopecia totalis) and/or body hair
(alopecia universalis).
2.	Diagnosis: Usually clinical diagnosis.
3.	Treatment13: First-­line therapy is topical steroids. Referral to dermatology
is warranted for consideration of other treatments. No evidence-­based
data that any therapy is better than placebo. Older children, adolescents, and young adults with longstanding localized areas of hair loss
have the best prognosis.
C. Traction Alopecia (see Fig. 8.20, Color Plates)
1.	Pathogenesis: Hairstyles that apply tension for long periods of time.
2.	Clinical presentation: Noninflammatory linear areas of hair loss at margins of hairline, part line, or scattered regions, depending on hairstyling
procedures used.
3.	Treatment: Avoidance of styling products or styles that result in traction.
If traction remains for long periods, condition may progress to permanent scarring hair loss.
D. Trichotillomania and Hair Pulling
1.	Pathogenesis: Alopecia due to compulsive urge to pull out one’s own
hair, resulting in irregular areas of incomplete hair loss. Mainly on the
scalp; can involve eyebrows and eyelashes. Onset is usually after age
10 and should be distinguished from hair twirling/pulling in younger
children that resolves without treatment in most cases.
2.	Clinical presentation: Characterized by hair of differing lengths; area of
hair loss can be unusual in shape.
3.	Treatment: Behavioral modification and consider psychiatric evaluation
(can be associated with anxiety, depression, and obsessive-­compulsive
disorder).

V. ACNE VULGARIS
A. Pathogenetic Factors
Follicular hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, Cutibacterium
acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) proliferation, and inflammation.
B. Risk Factors
Androgens, family history, and stress. No strong evidence that dietary
habits affect acne.
C. Clinical Presentation
1.	Noninflammatory lesions
a.	Closed comedone (whitehead): Accumulation of sebum and
keratinous material, resulting in white/skin-­colored papules without
surrounding erythema.
b.	Open comedone (blackhead): Dilated follicles filled with keratinocytes, oils, and melanin.

2.	Inflammatory lesions: Papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts with evidence of surrounding inflammation. Typically appear later in the course
of acne. Nodulocystic presentations are more likely to lead to hyperpigmentation and/or permanent scarring.
D. Treatment14–16 (Table 8.2)
1.	Skin care: Gentle nonabrasive cleaning. Avoid picking or popping
lesions. Vigorous scrubbing and abrasive cleaners can worsen acne.
2.	Topical first-­line therapies: Recommended for mild to moderate acne.
a.	Retinoids (Table EC 8.B)
(1) Normalize follicular keratinization and decrease inflammation.
(2) A pea-­sized amount should be applied to cover the entire face.
(3) Risks: Cause irritation and dryness of skin. Retinoids should be
used at night due to inactivation by sunlight. This class should
not be used during pregnancy.
(4) Three topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene) are
available by prescription in the United States. Adapalene 0.1%
gel has been approved for over-­the-­counter (OTC) use with
significant efficacy.17

aNumerous generic retinoids are available. Branded products are available under the following trade names: Atralin,

202  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
b.	Benzoyl peroxide (BPO)
(1) Oxidizing agent with antibacterial and mild anticomedolytic
properties.
(2) Washes may be most convenient formulation, as they can be
used in the shower.
(3) Risks: Can bleach hair, clothing, towels, and sheets.
c.	Salicylic acid: Topical comedolytic agent that may be found in OTC
face washes and serves as an alternative to a topical retinoid.
3.	Topical antimicrobials:
a.	Azelaic acid: Antimicrobial, comedolytic, and anti-­inflammatory.
Recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) for the
treatment of postinflammatory dyspigmentation (see Figures EC 8.P and
EC 8.S). Available in a 15% gel and a 20% cream (more efficacious).18
b.	Erythromycin and clindamycin: Avoid topical antibiotics as monotherapy. Topical BPO should be concurrently used to optimize efficacy
and avoid bacterial resistance.
4.	Oral antibiotics (Table EC 8.C): Recommended for moderate to severe
inflammatory acne that is resistant to topical treatment. These medications should be used with BPO or topical retinoid. Do not use as monotherapy. Limit to 3 months to minimize bacterial resistance.
a.	≥8 years old: Doxycycline or minocycline
b.	<8 years old, pregnancy, or tetracycline allergy: Azithromycin, erythromycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
c.	Erythromycin should be used with care due to increased risk of resistance. The AAD recommends reserving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for patients who have failed other treatments or are unable to
tolerate tetracyclines and macrolides.
5.	Hormonal therapy: Reduces sebum production and androgen levels.
Good option for pubertal females who have sudden onset of moderate to severe hormonal acne (often on lower face, jawline) and have
not responded to conventional first-­line therapies. Should not be used
as monotherapy. Combination oral contraceptives (Ortho Tri-­Cyclen,
Estrostep, and Yaz) or spironolactone (antiandrogen).
6.	Oral isotretinoin: Reserved for patients with severe nodular, cystic, or
scarring acne who do not respond to traditional therapy or who cannot be
weaned from oral antibiotics. Should be managed by a dermatologist. Most
patients have complete resolution of their acne after 16 to 20 weeks of use.
a.	Side effects:
(1) Teratogenicity: Patients and physicians are mandated by the FDA
to comply with the iPledge program to eliminate fetal exposure to
isotretinoin. Female patients with child-­bearing potential must use
two forms of birth control with routine pregnancy testing.
(2) Hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia, and bone marrow suppression,
a complete blood cell count, fasting lipid profile, and liver function tests should be obtained before initiation of therapy and
repeated at 4 and 8 weeks.

VI. COMMON NEONATAL DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS (FIG. 8.21;
FIGS. 8.22–8.30, COLOR PLATES)

B. Transient Neonatal Pustular Melanosis (see Figs. 8.23–8.24, Color
Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: More commonly affects full-­term infants with
darker pigmentation. At birth, appears as small pustules on non-­
erythematous bases that rupture and leave erythematous/hyperpigmented macules with a collarette of scale.
2.	Course: Self-­limited macules fade over weeks to months.
C. Miliaria (Heat Rash) (see Fig. 8.25, Color Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Common newborn rash associated with warmer
climates, incubator use, or occlusion with clothes/dressings. Appears
as small erythematous papules or pustules usually on face, scalp, or
intertriginous areas.
2.	Course: Rash resolves when infant is placed in cooler environment or
tight clothing/dressings are removed.
D. Milia (see Fig. 8.26, Color Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Common newborn lesions. Appears as 1-­to 3-­mm
white/yellow papules, frequently found on nose and face; due to retention of keratin and sebaceous materials in pilosebaceous follicles.
2.	Course: Self-­limited, resolves within first few weeks to few months of life.
E. Neonatal Acne (see Fig. 8.27, Color Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Seen in 20% of infants. Appears as inflammatory
papules or pustules without comedones, usually on face and scalp.
Secondary to effect of maternal and endogenous androgens on infant’s
sebaceous glands.
2.	Course: Peaks around 1 month, resolves within a few months, usually
without intervention. Does not increase risk of acne as an adolescent.
F. Seborrheic Dermatitis (Cradle Cap) (see Figs. 8.28–8.29, Color
Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Erythematous plaques with greasy yellow scales.
Located in areas rich with sebaceous glands, such as scalp, cheeks,
ears, eyebrows, intertriginous areas, diaper area. Unknown etiology.
Can be seen in newborns, more commonly in infants aged 1 to 4
months.
2.	Course: Self-­limited and resolves within a few weeks to months.

8

A. Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum (see Fig. 8.22, Color Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Most common rash of full-­term infants; incidence
declines with lower birth weight and prematurity. Appears as small erythematous macules and papules that evolve into pustules on erythematous bases. Rash most often occurs by 24 to 48 hours of life but can be
present at birth or emerge as late as 2 to 3 weeks.
2.	Course: Self-­limited, resolves within 5 to 7 days; recurrences possible.

3.	Treatment: Can remove scales on scalp with an emollient (e.g., mineral
or olive oil, or petroleum jelly) and a soft brush/fine comb. In more
severe cases, antifungal shampoos or low-­potency topical steroid can
shorten the course, although no shampoos are FDA-­approved for children less than 2 years of age.
G. Congenital Dermal Melanocytosis (formerly known as Mongolian Spots)
1.	Clinical presentation: Most common pigmented lesion of newborns,
usually seen in babies with darker skin tone. Appear as blue/gray
macules without definite disappearance of dermal melanocytes. Can be
mistaken for child abuse thus accurate documentation at newborn and
well-­child visits is important.
2.	Course: Spots typically fade within first few years of life, with majority
resolved or much improved by age 10 years.
H. Diaper Dermatitis19 (see Fig. 8.30, Color Plates)
1.	Clinical presentation: Irritant contact dermatitis characterized by
erythematous eruption on buttocks and genital areas with exclusion
of other potential causes. Rarely associated with diaper candidiasis,
characterized by a red, raised papular rash with small pustules at the
periphery. Tends to involve the skin creases.19
2.	Treatment: Frequent diaper changes, air exposure, adequate drying,
gentle cleaning, and judicious use of topical barrier preparations. If persistent, can use low-­potency topical steroid until cleared. For candidiasis,
treatment with topical nystatin, miconazole, or clotrimazole is sufficient.
Combination steroid/antifungal creams should be avoided due to steroid-­
related side effects and association with persistent fungal infections.20
VII. AUTOIMMUNE AND ALLERGIC DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS
(FIGS. 8.31–8.38, COLOR PLATES)
A. Contact Dermatitis
1.	Irritant dermatitis: Exposure to physical, chemical, or mechanical irritants to the skin. Common irritants include frequent hand washing, hot
water, lip-­licking, thumb-­sucking, and exposure to chemicals, paints, or
certain foods like citrus fruits.
2.	Allergic dermatitis (see Fig. 8.31, Color Plates):
a.	Pathogenesis: Immune reaction to an environmental trigger that
comes into contact with the skin. After initial sensitization period of
7 to 10 days in susceptible individuals, an allergic response occurs
with subsequent exposures.
b.	Common allergens: Toxicodendron spp. (poison ivy, oak, sumac),
nickel, cobalt, gold, dyes, fragrances, formaldehyde, and latex.
c.	Clinical presentation: Pruritic erythematous dermatitis that can progress to chronic scaling, lichenification, and pigment changes. Poison
ivy (see Fig. 8.32, Color Plates): Exposure to urushiol causes streaks
of erythematous papules, pustules, and vesicles. Highly pruritic,
can become edematous, especially if rash is on face or genitals. In
extreme cases, anaphylaxis can occur.

206  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
d.	Diagnosis: Careful history taking and recognition of unusual shapes
and locations suggesting an “outside job” allow for clinical diagnosis.
Patch testing may also be helpful when trigger cannot be identified.
e.	Treatment:
(1) Remove causative agent. Moisturize with ointment like Vaseline
or Aquaphor twice per day. Use antihistamine and/or oatmeal
baths as needed for itching, sedation, and sleeping, though they
do not directly impact the rash.
(2) Mild/moderate: Topical steroids twice a day for 1 week, then
daily for 1 to 2 weeks.
(3) Widespread/severe: Systemic steroids for 2 to 3 weeks, with
taper. There is no role for short courses of steroids because
eruption will flare when drug is stopped.
(4) For poison ivy contact, remove clothing and wash skin with mild
soap and water as soon as possible.
B. Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) (See Figs. 8.33–8.37, Color Plates)
1.	Pathogenesis: Due to inadequate skin barrier function from combination
of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in transepidermal water
loss. Can be associated with elevated serum IgE.
2.	Epidemiology21: Affects up to 20% of children in the United States, the
vast majority with onset before age 5 years. Other comorbidities may
follow including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies. Eczema
resolves or improves in over 75% of patients by adulthood.
3.	Clinical presentation: Dry, pruritic skin with acute changes, including
erythema, vesicles, crusting, and chronic changes, including scaling,
postinflammatory hypo-­or hyperpigmentation (see Figures EC 8.P and
EC 8.S), and lichenification.
a.	Infantile form: Erythematous, scaly lesions on the cheeks, scalp, and
extensor surfaces. Covered areas (especially the diaper area) are
usually spared.
b.	Childhood form: Lichenified plaques in flexural areas.
c.	Adolescence: More localized and lichenified skin changes.
Predominantly on skin flexures, hands, and feet.
4.	Treatment21: See Chapter 15
a.	Lifestyle: Avoiding triggers (products with alcohol, fragrances, astringents, sweat, allergens, and excessive bathing). Avoid scratching
(eczema is the “itch that rashes”).
b.	Bathing: Should be less than 5 minutes in lukewarm water with a
gentle bar soap and no washcloth or scrubbing. Skin should be
patted dry (not rubbed) and followed by rapid application of an emollient (“soak and smear”).
c.	Consider diluted bleach baths once or twice a week (mix 1/4 cup of
bleach in full tub of lukewarm water and soak for 10 minutes, then
rinse off with fresh water).
d.	Skin hydration: Frequent use of bland emollients with minimal water
content (Vaseline or Aquaphor). Avoid lotions, as they have high
water and low oil content, which worsens dry skin.

e.	Oral antihistamines: There is little evidence that antihistamines
improve skin lesions in atopic dermatitis. Non-­sedating antihistamines can be used for environmental allergies and hives. Sedating
antihistamines may be of transient benefit for sedation at bedtime.
f.	Treatment for inflammation:
(1) M
 ild disease: Topical steroids22 (Table 8.3): Low and medium
potency steroid ointments once or twice daily for 7 days during a flare. Severe flares may require a high-­potency steroid
for a longer duration of therapy, followed by a taper to a low-­
potency steroid. Use of topical steroids in areas where skin
is thin (groin, axilla, face, under breasts) should generally be
avoided. Short durations of low-­potency steroids may be used
as needed in these areas. Ointments can be applied over
steroid.
(2) M
 oderate disease: Crisaborole is a topical PDE4 inhibitor
approved for mild to moderate eczema with preliminary studies
of the 2% ointment showing improvement in the majority of
clinical signs and symptoms, particularly pruritus.23 Topical
calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus ointment, pimecrolimus cream)
are second-­line therapies which should only be used in consultation with a dermatologist due to FDA “black box” warnings
on these medications for theoretical increased risk of cancer,
although there are no data to confirm and long-­term safety studies are pending.24,25
(3) S
 evere disease: Phototherapy with narrowband UVB light is a
treatment option for older children and adolescents. Low-­dose
methotrexate is a consideration before cyclosporine. For many
dermatologists, low-­dose oral methotrexate is the first oral option
for severe disease unresponsive to aggressive topical therapy.
Oral cyclosporine is only used in severe cases of older children
and adolescents who have failed other treatments due to concern for renal compromise. Dupilumab is an IL-­4 receptor alpha
antagonist prescribed for refractory cases, currently with FDA
approval only for treatment in adults.
5.	Complications26:
a.	Bacterial superinfection: Usually S. aureus, sometimes Group A
Streptococcus. Depending on extent of infection, treat with topical
mupirocin or systemic antibiotics.
b.	Eczema herpeticum superinfection with herpes simplex virus can
cause severe systemic infection. Presents as vesiculopustular
lesions with central punched-­out erosions that do not respond to oral
antibiotics. Must be treated systemically with acyclovir or valacyclovir.
Should be evaluated by ophthalmologist if there is concern for eye
involvement.
C. Papular Urticaria (See Fig. 8.38, Color Plates)
1.	Pathogenesis: Type IV hypersensitivity reaction to fleas, mosquitos, or
bedbugs; also known as insect bite–induced hypersensitivity (IBIH).

132, Table 5.

2.	Clinical presentation/epidemiology: Summarized by the SCRATCH
principles27:
a.	Symmetric eruption: Exposed areas and scalp commonly affected.
Spares diaper region, palms, and soles.
b.	Cluster: Appear as “meal clusters” or “breakfast, lunch, and dinner”
which are linear or triangular groupings of lesions. Associated with
bedbugs and fleas.
c.	Rover not required: A remote animal exposure or lack of pet at home
does not rule out IBIH.
d.	Age: Tends to peak by age 2. Not seen in newborn period. Most tend
to develop tolerance by age 10.
e.	Target lesions: Especially in darkly pigmented patients. Time:
Emphasize chronic nature of eruption and need for patience and
watchful waiting.
f.	Confused pediatrician/parent: Diagnosis often met with disbelief by
parent and/or referring pediatrician.
g.	Household: Because of the nature of the hypersensitivity, usually only
affects one family member in the household.
3.	Management (3 Ps):
a.	Prevention: Wear protective clothing, use insect repellent when
outside (AAP guidelines recommend up to 30% DEET or 12% picaridin containing repellents), launder bedding and mattress pads for
bedbugs, and maximize flea control for pets.
b.	Pruritis control: Topical steroids or antihistamines may be of some
benefit.
c.	Patience: Can be frustrating because of its persistent, recurrent
nature. Ensure patients that their symptoms will resolve and they will
eventually develop tolerance.
D. Stevens-­Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
1.	Pathogenesis: Severe mucocutaneous reaction with partial to full
epidermal necrosis due to keratinocyte necrosis. Stevens-­Johnson
syndrome (SJS) has less than 10% involvement of body surface area
(BSA), whereas toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has greater than
30% BSA involvement. SJS/TEN defines the gap of 10% to 30%
involvement. Overall mortality for pediatric patients is less than 8%.
Commonly caused by medications initiated in previous 8 weeks including sulfonamide antibiotics, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and several oncologic drugs. May also be caused by Mycoplasma
pneumonia infections. Nearly one third of cases have no identified
trigger.
2.	Clinical presentation: Fever and flu-­like prodrome for 1 to 3 days prior to
mucocutaneous lesions. Ophthalmologic and oropharyngeal symptoms are often first sites of mucosal involvement. Urogenital mucosal
involvement seen in two-­thirds of patients may lead to urinary retention
and have significant long-­term anatomic changes in female patients.
Epidermal lesions are described as exquisitely tender (with pain out of

proportion), ill-­defined, coalescing macules and patches of erythema
with central purple-­to-­black areas. Lesions typically start on face and
trunk then spread in a symmetric distribution sparing the scalp, palms,
and soles. Bullae form with disease progression. Then, the epidermis
sloughs with positive Nikolsky and Asboe-­Hansen (lateral expansion
of bullae with pressure) signs. Acute phase may last 8 to 12 days with
reepithelization requiring up to four weeks.
3.	Diagnosis: Although usually not necessary, clinical diagnosis may be
confirmed with a skin biopsy. Additional work up includes CBC, CMP,
ESR, CRP, bacterial and fungal cultures, M. pneumoniae PCR, and
CXR.
4.	Treatment: Remove offending agent, supportive care, and close monitoring of all organ systems in the inpatient/ICU setting. There is controversy
regarding IVIG and single dose of TNF-­alpha inhibitor early in course.
Systemic steroids probably should not be used.
5.	Complications: At risk for serious complications including secondary
bacterial infections (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), and epithelial necrosis of the GI tract. Most common complication in children is corneal scarring and dry eye.

X. ONLINE CONTENT
A. Autoimmune and Allergic Lesions
1.	Autoimmune bullous diseases
a.	Very rare in children but should be considered if bullous lesions do
not respond to standard therapy. Suspicion for any of the following should warrant referral to a dermatologist for diagnosis and
management.
b.	Pemphigus vulgaris (Figure EC 8.A):
(1) Pathogenesis: IgG autoantibodies to epidermal adhesion molecules, which interrupt integrity of epidermis and/or mucosa and
result in extensive blister formation.
(2) Clinical presentation: Flaccid bullae that start in the mouth and
spread to face, scalp, trunk, extremities, and other mucosal
membranes. Positive Nikolsky sign. Ruptured blisters are painful
and prone to secondary infection. Can lead to impaired oral
intake if there is significant oral mucosal involvement.
(3) Treatment: Systemic glucocorticoids, rituximab, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin.
c.	Pemphigus foliaceus:
(1) Pathogenesis: IgG autoantibodies bind to the same antigen as
in bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome;
thus lesions are superficial and rupture easily. Can be triggered
by certain drugs, including thiol compounds and penicillins.
(2) Clinical presentation: Scaling, crusting erosions on erythematous base
that appear on face, scalp, trunk, and back. No mucosal involvement. Lesions are more superficial than in pemphigus vulgaris.
(3) Treatment: Systemic glucocorticoids or rituximab. There is currently a move away from systemic steroids due to good efficacy
and safety data on rituximab.
d.	Bullous pemphigoid:
(1) Pathogenesis: Autoantibodies to the epithelial basement membrane that results in an inflammatory cascade and causes separation of epidermis from dermis and epithelium from subepithelium.

(2) Clinical presentation: Prodrome of inflammatory lesions that
progresses into large (1 to 3 cm), tense, extremely pruritic bullae
on trunk, flexural regions, and intertriginous areas. Few patients
have oral mucosal lesions. Negative Nikolsky sign.
(3) Treatment: Immunosuppression (topical glucocorticoids,
systemic glucocorticoids, glucocorticoid-­sparing agents like
methotrexate, mycophenolate, or azathioprine).
e.	Dermatitis herpetiformis:
(1) Pathogenesis: Strong genetic predisposition and link to gluten
intolerance/celiac disease. IgA deposits found in dermal papillae.
(2) Clinical presentation: Symmetric, intensely pruritic papulovesicles clustered on extensor surfaces.
(3) Treatment: Dapsone, strict gluten-­free diet.
B. Nail Disorders28
1.	Acquired nail disorders
a.	Paronychia: Red, tender swelling of proximal or lateral nail folds
(Figures EC 8.B and EC 8.C)
(1) Acute form: Caused by bacterial invasion after trauma to cuticle
(a)	Clinical features: Exquisite pain, sudden swelling, and
abscess formation around one nail.
(b)	Treatment: Responds quickly to drainage of abscess and
warm tap-­water soaks; occasionally anti-­staphylococcal
antibiotics required.

(2) Chronic form: May involve one or several nails, history of frequent exposure to water or thumb-­sucking; causative organisms
Candida species, usually C. albicans.
(a)	Clinical features: Mild tenderness, minimal purulence, nail
may be discolored or dystrophic.
(b)	Treatment: Resolves with topical antifungal agents and water
avoidance; heals without scarring when thumb-­sucking ends.
b.	Nail dystrophy: Distortion and discoloration of normal nail-­plate structure; often traumatic or inflammatory causes (Figures EC 8.D-EC 8.I).
(1) Onychomycosis: A result of dermatophyte fungal infection,
unusual before puberty. Oral and topical antifungals (terbinafine,
itraconazole, ciclopirox) are used off-­label with high cure rates
and few adverse effects.29
(2) Subungual hematoma: Brown-­black nail discoloration following
crush injury. Usually resolves without treatment; large, painful
blood collections may be drained. Must differentiate from melanoma and melanonychia.
c.	Nail changes and systemic disease (Figures EC 8.J and EC 8.K)
(1)	Clubbing: Complication of chronic lung or heart disease.
(2)	Beau lines: Transverse, white lines/grooves that move distally
with nail growth; due to growth arrest from systemic illness,
medications, or toxins.
(3)	Onychomadesis: Accentuated Beau lines often with separation
of the nail from base of nail. Usually self-­limited and very common following Coxsackie A6 hand, foot, and mouth disease.

C. Disorders of Pigmentation30
1.	Hyperpigmentation
a.	Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN): Melanocytic nevi that are either
present at birth or appear within the first few months of life in 1% to
3% of neonates.31
(1) Appearance: Black or tan in color with irregular borders and
often dark terminal hairs.
(2) Risks:
(a)	Melanoma—At least 5% of large CMN greater than 20 cm
with 70% of this cohort having cancerous transformation
by 10 years of age.32 The presence of approximately 20
satellite nevi (smaller congenital nevi) also increases risk of
melanoma.
(b)	Neurocutaneous melanosis—Children with large, multiple,
satellite nevi, or lesions over the spine are at risk for leptomeningeal involvement with symptoms that may include
hydrocephalus and seizures that may require evaluation by
gadolinium contrast MRI.33,34
b.	Epidermal melanosis: Most lesions appear tan or light brown

appear at birth or during childhood in 10% to 20% of normal
individuals, sizes vary from freckles to patches, may involve any

1 (≥6 lesions, each greater than 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal,
or greater than 15 mm in postpubertal child) or other syndromes.
(2) Freckles (ephelides): Reddish-­tan and brown macules on sun-­
exposed surfaces, usually 2 to 3 mm in diameter. Serve as an
independent risk factor for skin cancers in adulthood and can
be an added sign of the importance of photoprotection which
may decrease additional lesions.
(3) Acanthosis nigricans (Figures EC 8.Q and EC 8.R): Brown-­to-­
black hyperpigmentation with velvety or warty skin in intertriginous areas, typically found in the skin folds of the neck and

axilla. Most commonly occur in obese individuals with insulin
resistance at risk for type II diabetes. Finding may decrease after
puberty with weight reduction.
c.	Dermal melanosis: Slate-­gray, dark brown, or bluish-­green lesions.
(1) Post-­inflammatory hyperpigmentation (Figure EC 8.S): Most
common cause of increased pigmentation.
(a)	Pathogenesis: Follows inflammatory processes in the skin
(e.g., diaper dermatitis, insect bites, drug reactions, traumatic
injuries).
(b)	Clinical features: Localized lesions, follow distribution of resolving disorder. More prominent in darkly pigmented children.
(c)	Treatment: Lesions typically fade over several months.
Photoprotection is critical with protective clothing and
sunscreen of at least SPF 30. Individuals should also avoid
physical trauma to areas as well as medications that may
worsen hyperpigmentation. Intervention with medication is
not always required; however, when it is, hydroquinone is
first-­line therapy.35
(2) Acquired nevomelanocytic nevi (aka pigmented nevi or moles)
(Figure EC 8.T)
(a)	Pathogenesis: Develop in early childhood as flat lesions
called junctional nevi, then develop into compound nevi
when nevus cells migrate into the dermis and lesions
enlarge and become papular.
(b)	Clinical features: Increase in darkness, size, and number during puberty; generally do not exceed 5 mm and retain regularity in color, texture, and symmetry; on sun-­exposed areas.
(c)	Treatment: Excision unnecessary, unless cosmetic concern.

(d)	Changes associated with development of melanoma: See
ABCDEs of Melanoma as well as burning, itching, or redness.
(3) Melanomas (Figure EC 8.U)
(a)	Pathogenesis: May occur de novo or within acquired or
congenital nevi.
(b)	Epidemiology: High lifetime risk in those with presence of
multiple, large, and irregularly pigmented, bordered, textured nevi and family history of malignant melanomas.
(c)	Management: Children in high-­risk families must be carefully observed for atypical nevi development especially in
adolescence. Changing nevi with unusual appearance or an
“ugly duckling” (mole that is different from all other moles)
must be considered for biopsy.
(d)	ABCDEs of Melanoma: Criteria for older children and adults is
as follows: Asymmetric shape, Borders that are irregular, Color
that is variable throughout lesion, Diameter greater than the
size of a pencil eraser (>6 mm), Evolution (change is the most
important factor in melanoma diagnosis).36 Pediatric patients
up to age 20 have their own ABCD criteria: Amelanotic,
Bleeding, Bump, Color uniformity, De novo, any Diameter.37
(4) Melanonychia (see Figure EC 8.G): Darkened nail pigment that
most commonly is caused by melanin or hemosiderin deposits
in the nail plate. Regular, organized longitudinal lines tend to be
benign whereas irregularities are associated with nail melanoma
in adults. However, nail matrix nevi in children often have features
that would be considered red flags in the adult population; thus,

these criteria may not be applied to children. There are no pediatric specific guidelines for management. Typically, this clinical finding is due to nail matric nevi. Nail melanomas are very rare though
children with this clinical finding warrant close follow up.38,39
(5) Spitz nevus (aka spindle and epithelial cell nevus) (Figure EC
8.V): Innocent nevomelanocytic nevus often confused with
malignant melanoma.
(a)	Clinical features: Rapidly growing, dome-­shaped, red or
reddish-­brown papules or nodules on face or lower extremities that reach full size quickly.
(b)	Management: Observe if features of innocent acquired
nevus are present. Consider referral to pediatric dermatology
if unusual atypical features present.
2.	Hypopigmentation and depigmentation
a.	Localized hypopigmentation
(1) Hypopigmented macules (Figure EC 8.W)
(a)	Epidemiology: 0.1% to 0.5% of normal newborns have a
single hypopigmented macule but it may be a marker for
tuberous sclerosis as 70% to 90% of those affected have
such macules on the trunk at birth.
(b)	C linical features: Trunk involvement is most common. Majority are lancet or ash-­leaf shaped, but may
be round, oval, dermatomal, segmental, or irregularly
shaped. Vary from pinpoint confetti spots to large
patches (>10 cm).

Pediatric Dermatology. 4th ed. China: Saunders Elsevier; 2013:48–68.)

(c)	Diagnosis: Wood lamp helpful in lightly pigmented children.
(d)	Management: In those where systemic disease is suspected,
close observation for other cutaneous findings and systemic
symptoms is indicated.
(2) Post-­inflammatory hypopigmentation (Figure EC 8.X)
(a)	Pathogenesis: May appear after an inflammatory skin condition.
(b)	Clinical features: Seen in association with primary lesions
of underlying disorder (such as atopic dermatitis). Patches
usually variable in size and irregularly shaped. Concomitant
hyperpigmentation is common.
b.	Diffuse hypopigmentation
(1) A
 lbinism: Heterogeneous group of inherited disorders manifested
by generalized hypopigmentation or depigmentation of skin, eyes,
and hair. These individuals should undergo ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for various associated conditions. Sun protection
is important as well as regular skin exams.
3.	Dyspigmentation
a.	Blaschkoid dyspigmentation40: Congenital hypopigmentation and
hyperpigmentation along the lines of Blaschko (Figure EC 8.Y).
(1)	Patterns of hyper-­or hypopigmentation: Whorl shape on trunk,
V-­shape on the back, waves on the vertex scalp.
(2)	Pathogenesis: Blaschko lines occur due to genetic mosaicism.
(3)	Children unlikely to have or develop serious extracutaneous
involvement.

See additional content on Expert Consult

I. DEVELOPMENTAL DEFINITIONS1,2
A. Developmental Streams
1.	Gross Motor Skills: Descriptions of posture and locomotion—in general,
how a child moves from one location to another.
2.	Fine-­Motor and Visual-­Motor Problem-­Solving Skills: Upper extremity and hand manipulative abilities and hand-­eye coordination. These
require an intact motor substrate and a given level of nonverbal cognitive ability.
3.	Language: The ability to understand and communicate with another
person. This is the best predictor of intellectual performance in the
absence of a communication disorder or significant hearing impairment.
4.	Personal-­Social Skills: Communicative in origin; represent the cumulative impact of language comprehension and problem-­solving skills.
5.	Adaptive Skills: Skills concerned with self-­help or activities of daily living.
B. Developmental Quotient (DQ)
1.	A calculation that reflects the rate of development in any given stream;
represents the percentage of normal development present at the time of
testing.
Developmental age
DQ =
× 100
Chronological age
2.	Two separate developmental assessments over time are more predictive
of later abilities than a single assessment.
3.	In contrast to developmental quotient (DQ), intelligence quotient (IQ)
has statistical reliability and validity.2
C. Abnormal Development
1.	Delay: Performance significantly below average (DQ <70) in a given
area of development. May occur in a single stream or several streams
(“global developmental delay”).
2.	Deviancy: Atypical development within a single stream, such as developmental milestones occurring out of sequence. Deviancy does not
necessarily imply abnormality, but should alert one to the possibility that
problems may exist.
		Example: An infant who rolls at an early age may have abnormally
increased tone.
211

212  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Dissociation: A substantial difference in the rate of development
between two or more streams.
		Example: Increased motor delay relative to cognition seen in some
children with cerebral palsy (CP).

II. GUIDELINES FOR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR
A. Developmental Milestones (Table 9.1)
Developmental assessment is based on the premise that milestone acquisition occurs at a specific rate in an orderly and sequential manner.
B. Age-­Appropriate Behavioral Issues in Infancy and Early Childhood:
See Table 9.2.
III. DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AND EVALUATION OF
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
A. Developmental Surveillance and Screening Guidelines
1.	Developmental surveillance should be included in every well-­child
visit, and any concerns should be addressed immediately with formal
screening. This includes direct observation of the child and eliciting and
attending to the parent’s concerns.
2.	Standardized developmental screening should be administered at
9-­month, 18-­month, and 30-­month well-­child visits, in the absence of
developmental concerns. If a 30-­month visit is not possible, this screening can be done at the 24-­month visit.
3.	See full American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline for developmental screening algorithm.3
B. Commonly Used Developmental Screening and Assessment Tools:
See Table 9.3
C. Identification of Developmental “Red Flags”: See Table 9.4
D. Evaluation of Abnormal Development
1.	Referral to developmental and appropriate subspecialists.
2.	Referral to early intervention services for children aged 0 to 3 years
(see Section V).
3.	Medical evaluation as outlined in Tables 9.5–9.7.
4.	Genetic evaluation (Table 9.8) is warranted for all children with developmental delay or intellectual disability (ID) if the cause is not known (e.g.,
previous traumatic brain injury or neurologic insult).

IV. SPECIFIC DISORDERS OF DEVELOPMENT
A. Overview
1.	Mental and/or physical impairment(s) that cause significant limitations
in functioning.
2.	Developmental diagnosis is a functional description; identification of an
etiology is important to further inform treatment, prognosis, comorbidities, and future risk.

Comfort quietly, avoid reinforcing behavior (i.e., avoid night feeds). Do not play
at night. Introducing cereal or solid food does not reduce awakening. Develop
a consistent bedtime routine. Place baby in bed while drowsy and not fully
asleep.
Use a transitional object (e.g., special toy, blanket). Use routine or ritual to separate
from parent. May continue until 24 months but can reduce in intensity.

Exploration of environment, danger of injury

18 months

Need for limit
setting
Temper tantrums

24 months

Toilet training

Separation anxiety at night
Biting, hitting, kicking in frustration

Occur with frustration, attention-­seeking rage,
negativity/refusal
Child needs to demonstrate readiness: shows interest,
neurologic maturity (i.e., recognizes urge to urinate
or defecate), ability to walk to bathroom and undress
self, desire to please/imitate parents, increasing
periods of daytime dryness

Keep lights off. Avoid picking child up or feeding. May reassure verbally at regular
intervals or place a transitional object in crib.
Say “no” with negative facial cues. Begin time out (1 minute/year of age). No eye
contact or interaction, place in a nonstimulating location. May restrain child
gently until cooperation is achieved.
Avoid punishing exploration or poor judgment. Emphasize child-­proofing and
distraction.
Try to determine cause, react appropriately (i.e., help child who is frustrated,
ignore attention-­seeking behavior). Make sure child is in a safe location.
Age range for toilet training is usually 2–4 years. Give guidance early; may
introduce potty seat but avoid pressure or punishment for accidents. Wait until
the child is ready. Expect some periods of regression, especially with stressors.

Guidance
Allow for special time with parent, 10–20 min daily of one-­on-­one time exclusively
devoted to the older sibling(s). Child chooses activity with parent. No interruptions. May not be taken away as punishment.
Reassure child, explain that he or she had a bad dream. Leave bedroom door
open, use a nightlight, demonstrate there are no monsters under the bed.
Discuss dream the following day. Avoid scary movies or television shows.
May be familial, not volitional.
Prevention: For several nights, awaken child 15 min before terrors typically occur.
Avoid overtiredness.
Acute: Be calm; speak in soft, soothing, repetitive tones; help child return to
sleep. Protect child against injury.

Conceptual Domain

Social Domain

Mild

For preschool children, there may be no obvious conceptual differences.
For school-­aged children and adults, there are difficulties in learning
academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time, or money,
with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-­related expectations. In adults, abstract thinking, executive function (i.e., planning,
strategizing, priority setting, and cognitive flexibility), and short-­term
memory, as well as functional use of academic skills (e.g., reading,
money management) are impaired. There is a somewhat concrete
approach to problems and solutions compared with age mates.
All through development, the individual’s conceptual skills lag markedly
behind those of peers. For preschoolers, language and preacademic
skills may develop slowly. For school-­aged children, progress in
reading, writing, mathematics, and understanding of time and
money occurs slowly across the school years, and is markedly limited
compared with that of peers. For adults, academic skill development
is typically at an elementary level, and support is required for all use
of academic skills in work and personal life. Ongoing assistance on a
daily basis is needed to complete conceptual tasks of day-­to-­day life,
and others may take over these responsibilities fully for the individual.

Compared with typically developing age mates, the individual is immature in
social interactions (e.g., difficulty in accurately perceiving peers’ social cues).
Communication, conversation, and language are more concrete or immature than
expected for age. There may be difficulties regulating emotion and behavior in
age-­appropriate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by peers in social situations. There is limited understanding of risk in social situations; social judgment
is immature for age, and the person is at risk of being manipulated by others
(gullibility).

Moderate

The individual shows marked differences from peers in social and communicative
behavior across development. Spoken language is typically a primary tool for
social communication, but is much less complex than that of peers. Capacity for
relationships is evident in ties to family and friends, and the individual may have
successful friendships across life and sometimes romantic relations in adulthood.
However, individuals may not perceive or interpret social cues accurately. Social
judgment and decision-­making abilities are limited, and caretakers must assist
the person with life decisions. Friendships with typically developing peers are often
affected by communication or social limitations. Significant social and communicative support is needed in work settings for success.

TABLE EC 9.B
SEVERITY LEVELS FOR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY

Severity Level
Severe

Conceptual Domain
Attainment of conceptual skills is limited. The individual generally has
little understanding of written language or of concepts involving numbers, quantity, time, and money. Caretakers provide extensive support
for problem solving throughout life.

Social Domain
Spoken language is quite limited in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be
single words or phrases, and may be supplemented through augmentative means.
Speech and communication are focused on the here and now within everyday
events. Language is used for social communication more than for explication.
Individuals understand simple speech and gestural communication. Relationships
with family members and familiar others are a source of pleasure and help.

Profound

Conceptual skills generally involve the physical world rather than
symbolic processes. The individual may use objects in goal-­directed
fashion for self-­care, work, and recreation. Certain visuospatial skills
(e.g., matching and sorting based on physical characteristics) may be
acquired. However, co-­occurring motor and sensory impairments may
prevent functional use of objects.

The individual has very limited understanding of symbolic communication in speech
or gesture. He or she may understand some simple instructions or gestures. The
individual expresses his or her own desires and emotions largely through nonverbal,
nonsymbolic communication. The individual enjoys relationships with well-­known
family members, caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates and responds to
social interactions through gestural and emotional cues. Co-­occurring sensory and
physical impairments may prevent many social activities.

4.	Interventions/Treatment
a.	Educational interventions, visual supports, naturalistic developmental
behavioral interventions (integrating behavioral and child-­responsive
strategies to teach developmentally appropriate skills in a more natural and interactive setting).16,17
b.	Referral to SLP, OT/sensory-­based interventions.
G. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: See Chapter 24
V. LONGITUDINAL CARE OF CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL
DISORDERS AND DISABILITIES
A. Interdisciplinary Involvement
1.	Neurodevelopmental pediatrician, child neurologist, developmental/
behavioral pediatrician, other medical subspecialties as indicated (e.g.,
orthopedics for CP can be very important).
2.	Genetic counseling for families of children with a genetic condition.
3.	Psychologists for formal testing, counseling.
4.	Rehabilitation and therapists, including physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), and SLP.
5.	Educators
B. Relevant Laws and Regulation
1.	The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) sets forth
­regulations in the following areas for states that receive federal
funding6,18:
a.	Entitles all children with qualifying disabilities to a free and
­appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.
b.	Early intervention services: Infants and toddlers younger than
3 years may be referred for evaluation to receive developmental
services. Eligibility criteria vary by state; see The National Early
Childhood Technical Assistance Center (www.ectacenter.org) for
details.

c.	Qualifying disabilities: Children aged 3 to 21 years with autism spectrum disorder, ID, specific learning disability (LD), hearing or visual
impairment, speech or language impairment, orthopedic impairment,
traumatic brain injury, emotional disturbance, or other health impairment are eligible.
d.	Individualized Education Program (IEP): Written statement that
includes a child’s current capabilities, goals and how they will be
measured, and services required. A comprehensive team is needed
to develop and implement the IEP.
e.	Transition Services: School systems must provide transitions services
that prepare students for post-­secondary activities and IEPs must
include a statement of transition service needs starting no later than
age 14. The student must be included in the IEP process starting at
age 14.
2.	Head Start and Early Head Start: Programs instituted by the federal
government to promote school readiness of low-­income children
aged 3 to 5 years and younger than 3 years, respectively, within their
communities.19
3.	Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibit discrimination against individuals
with any disability, more broadly defined as an impairment that limits
function.20
VI. TRANSITIONS FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT CARE FOR YOUTH
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
A. The Need
Research reveals health disparities between adults with developmental disabilities and those without. Disparities include:
1.	Increased ED utilization
2.	Lack of identified adult provider
3.	Worse self-­perception of health21
B. The Role of the Pediatric Provider
AAP Consensus Statement on Transitions22,23:
1.	Identify a health professional as point person to work with the youth and
family on transition process.
2.	Create health care transition plan by age 14 with the youth and family.
3.	Apply same guidelines for primary and preventive care for all adolescents and young adults.
4.	Ensure affordable, continuous insurance coverage.
C. Transition Domains
Transitions for young adults with disabilities occur across many domains of
life and warrant support from an interdisciplinary team (Table 9.10).

I. DIABETES
A. Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus1-­3
Diagnostic criteria (must meet one of four):
1.	Symptoms of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, frequent yeast
infections) and random blood glucose (BG) ≥200 mg/dL
2.	Fasting plasma glucose (FPG = no caloric intake for at least 8 hours)
≥126 mg/dL
3.	Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 2-­hour post-­load plasma
glucose of ≥200 mg/dL
4.	Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5%
NOTE: In the absence of symptoms of hyperglycemia, FPG or OGTT should
be repeated on another day.
B. Definition of Increased Risk (Prediabetes)
1.	FPG 100 to 125 mg/dL
2.	2-­hour post-­OGTT 140 to 199 mg/dL
3.	HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%
C. Interpreting Hemoglobin A1c1,2
1.	Estimates average BG for the past 3 months.
2.	HbA1c of 6% approximately equals an average BG of 130 mg/dL; each
additional 1% ≈ 30 mg/dL more.
3.	Unreliable in patients with abnormal red cell lifespan or morphology
(e.g., sickle cell disease, spherocytosis).
4.	Although the HbA1c criterion has been accepted by the American
Diabetes Association for the diagnosis of diabetes in adults, this criterion
remains controversial in children, especially as it relates to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
D. Etiology: Distinguishing Between Types of Diabetes Mellitus1,2
1.	Type 1 (T1DM) versus T2DM (most common types, polygenic; Table 10.1)
2.	Other forms of diabetes4,5
a.	Monogenic diabetes: 1% to 2% of diabetes mellitus (DM). Due to
single-­gene mutations, typically relating to insulin production or
release. Identifying gene can have clinical significance.
(1) Suspect if autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of early-­onset
(<25 years) DM, insulin independence, absent T2DM phenotype
(non-­obese), or preservation of C-­peptide.

E. Screening for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus1,6
1.	Who to screen: Children who are overweight [body mass index (BMI)
>85th percentile] and have one or more of the following risk factors:
a.	Maternal history of diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus during
child’s gestation
b.	Family history of T2DM in a first-­or second-­degree relative
c.	Race/ethnicity: African American, Native American, Hispanic, Asian,
or Pacific Islander
d.	Signs associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or small-­
for-­gestational-­age birth weight)
2.	How to screen: Fasting plasma glucose, OGTT, or HbA1c
3.	When to screen: Begin at the age of 10 years or at the onset of puberty
(whichever occurs first), and repeat at a minimum of every 3 years or
more often if BMI is increasing.

F. Additional Testing in New-­Onset Diabetes
1.	Diabetes autoantibodies1,2: Recommended for all children with suspected
T2DM. No universal agreement regarding whether to test all patients.
a.	Includes islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) and antibodies to GAD
(GAD65), insulin, and tyrosine phosphotases IA-­2, IA-­2β, ZnT8.
b.	Suggestive of T1DM if present, though about 5% of T1DM will not
have measurable ICAs, and some children with T2DM will have
measureable ICAs.
2.	Screening for autoimmune diseases in T1DM6:
a.	Thyroid disease (present in 17% to 30% of patients with T1DM):
Screen with TSH when clinically well and consider screening for thyroid antibodies. If TSH normal, recheck every 1 to 2 years or sooner
if symptoms develop.
b.	Celiac disease (present in 1.6% to 16.4% of patients with T1DM):
Screen with tissue transglutaminase (TTG) IgA antibody and total
IgA. Repeat within 2 years of diabetes diagnosis and again after 5
years. Repeat more frequently if there are symptoms or a first degree
relative with celiac disease.
G. Management of Diabetes6-­8
1.	Diabetes medications FDA-­approved for children:
a.	Insulin: See Tables 10.2 and 10.3 for calculations. Insulin doses are
subsequently adjusted based on actual blood sugars.
b.	Metformin: FDA-­approved in children ≥10 years old, though
sometimes used off-­label in younger children. Main side effects are

gastrointestinal and are often transient. Extended release option
available for patients with GI side effects.
2.	T1DM management: The majority of children with T1DM should be
treated with intensive insulin regimens, either via multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous infusion.
3.	T2DM management:
a.	Lifestyle modification therapy (nutrition and physical activity) and
metformin should be initiated at time of diagnosis.
b.	Insulin therapy should be initiated if distinction between T1DM and
T2DM is unclear, when HbA1c ≥8.5%, when random BG ≥250, or when
patient with known T2DM is not meeting glycemic target with metformin
and lifestyle modification alone. NOTE: If significant hyperglycemia (BG >
600) or ketosis is present, patient should be evaluated for DKA/HHS.
4.	Goals of therapy: A1c <7.5% for T1DM and <7% for T2DM in patients
on metformin alone (individualized to avoid excessive hypoglycemia).
5.	Interdisciplinary care team should include mental health provider and
medical nutrition therapy with initial education and annual update.
Regularly assess for eating disorders, disease-­related coping, depression, and psychosocial stressors impacting diabetes management.
H. Diabetes-­Related Devices9,10
1.	Technology is rapidly changing, but general principles are described
below.
2.	Insulin pumps: Contain rapid acting insulin only and provide basal and
bolus insulin. Doses can be programmed to vary throughout the day.
Settings consist of:

NOTE: Be aware that there are stronger concentrations of various types of insulin available (e.g., U-­500 regular insulin,
which is 5 times more concentrated than U-­100 regular insulin; U-­300 insulin glargine). There are also pre-­mixed combinations of rapid or short AND intermediate acting insulin (e.g., 70% NPH/30% regular [Humulin 70/30]).

232  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
a.	Basal rate—continuous insulin infusion
b.	Carbohydrate coverage—insulin to carbohydrate ratio
c.	Hyperglycemia correction—based on correction factor and target
blood glucose
NOTE: There is risk for DKA with interruptions in insulin delivery (e.g.,
pump malfunction) given lack of long-­acting insulin.
3.	Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs): Measure glucose concentration in
interstitial fluid continuously and provide alerts for high and low glucose
levels.
4.	Sensor augmented insulin pump therapy: Integration of continuous glucose
monitor and insulin pump to adjust insulin delivery based on blood glucose.
I. Monitoring6,8,9,11
1.	Glycemic control:
a.	Assessment of blood glucose using glucometer or CGM—multiple
times daily (before meals/snacks, at bedtime, prior to exercise, with
symptoms of hypoglycemia, after treating for hypoglycemia, before
driving, etc.)
b.	HbA1c every 3 months
2.	Urine ketones should be checked with persistent hyperglycemia, any
illness (regardless of blood glucose level), or with nausea/vomiting.
3.	Associated conditions or complications: See Table 10.4.
J. Diabetic Emergencies12,13
1.	Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
a.	Definition: Hyperglycemia (or euglycemia in a patient with known
diabetes), ketonemia, ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis (pH <7.30,
bicarbonate <15 mEq/L)
b.	BG reflects hydration status, pH reflects DKA severity
c.	Symptoms: Nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, fruity breath, altered
mental status, Kussmaul respirations
d.	Precipitating factors: New-­onset DM, known diabetes with missed
insulin doses, insulin pump/infusion site malfunction, or physiologic
stress due to acute illness
e.	Management: See Fig. 10.1. Because the fluid and electrolyte
requirements vary greatly from patient to patient, guidelines are
only a starting point and therapy must be individualized based on
patient characteristics. NOTE: Initial insulin administration may cause
transient worsening of the acidosis as potassium is driven into cells
in exchange for hydrogen ions.
f.	Cerebral edema: Most severe complication of DKA. Overly aggressive hydration and rapid correction of hyperglycemia may play
a role in its development. Risk factors include severe acidosis,
evidence of renal insufficiency, young age and new onset, use of
bicarbonate.

g.	Once DKA is resolved, transition to subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. See
Tables 10.2 and 10.3 for calculations or resume home insulin doses.
2.	Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)
a.	Definition: Extreme hyperglycemia (BG >600 mg/dL) and hyperosmolarity (>320 mOsm/kg), without significant ketosis or acidosis.
b.	Characteristics of HHS: Gradually increasing polyuria and polydipsia
leading to profound dehydration, altered consciousness.
c.	Management:
(1) Fluids: Fluids alone will decrease BG due to dilution, promotion
of glucosuria, and increased glucose uptake with improved circulation. Fluid replacement should be more rapid than in DKA
with goal of gradual decline in serum sodium (about 0.5 mEq/
dL/h) and osmolality. Bolus ≥20 cc/kg 0.9% saline and repeat
until perfusion improved. Then start maintenance fluids plus
deficit replacement over 24 to 48 hours using 0.45% to 0.75%
saline (if perfusion inadequate, consider isotonic fluids). Urine
output should also be replaced.
(2) Insulin therapy: Start insulin (0.025 to 0.05 unit/kg/h) when BG
no longer declining at least 50 mg/dL/h with fluids alone. Titrate
insulin to decrease BG by 75 to 100 mg/dL/h.

during DKA therapy. However serum K levels may be normal or elevated as a result of
the shift of K to the extracellular compartment in the setting of acidosis.
b) Appropriate to transition to SC insulin once pH >7.3, normal anion gap, normal physical

triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are seen in 10% to 23% of obese
children. There does not appear to be a benefit to treating these individuals.
Values tend to normalize with weight loss. Could consider testing for thyroid
antibodies to further clarify whether there is true thyroid dysfunction.

Clinical Symptoms

Onset

Etiology

Management

Follow-­up

Symptoms usually develop by
2 weeks; almost always by
6 weeks.
Some infants may be relatively
asymptomatic if not caused
by absence of thyroid gland.

Primary: Defect of fetal thyroid
development most common.
Other causes include TSH
receptor mutation or thyroid
dyshormonogenesis.
OR
Central: Deficiency of TSH or
thyrotropin-­releasing hormone
(TRH).

Replacement with L-­thyroxine
once newborn screen is
positive, pending results of
confirmatory testing.a Goal T4
in upper half of normal range.
In primary hypothyroidism,
TSH should be kept in normal
range for age.

Monitor T4 and TSH 1–2 weeks
after initiation and then every
2 weeks until TSH normalizes.
Once levels are adequate follow per schedule listed below.
Treated patients are still at risk
for developmental delay.

Can occur as early as 2 years
old.

Primary: Can be caused by
Hashimoto thyroiditis (diagnosis
supported by + antithyroglobulin or antimicrosomal antibodies), head/neck radiation.
OR
Central: Caused by pituitary/
hypothalamic insults including
brain tumor.

Replacement with l-­thyroxine.a
Targets for TSH and T4 same
as for congenital hypothyroidism above.

Follow every 1–3 months during
the first 12 months, every 2–4
months until 3 years, and
then every 3–12 months until
growth complete. Follow 4–6
weeks after any dose change.

PRIMARY/CONGENITAL
Large fontanelles, lethargy, constipation, hoarse cry, hypotonia,
hypothermia, jaundice. Most
often picked up on newborn
screen.

ACQUIRED
Growth deceleration, coarse brittle
hair, dry skin, delayed tooth
eruption, cold intolerance.

aBecause of the risk of inducing adrenal crisis if adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is present, the treatment of central hypothyroidism should not be started until normal ACTH/cortisol function is

documented.
NOTE: Thyroid hormone levels in premature infants are lower than those seen in full-­term infants. Furthermore, the TSH surge seen at approximately 24 hours of age in full-­term babies does not appear in preterm infants.
In this population, lower levels are associated with increased illness; however, the effect of replacement therapy remains controversial.

3.	Newborn screening for hypothyroidism16,20: Mandated in all 50 states.
Measures a combination of TSH and T4, based on the particular state’s
algorithm; 1:25 abnormal tests are confirmed. Congenital hypothyroidism has prevalence of 1:3000 to 1:4000 U.S. infants. If abnormal
results are found, clinicians should follow recommendations of the
American College of Medical Genetics ACT Sheets and Algorithm for
confirmation testing.
C. Hyperthyroidism
1.	General features:
a.	Epidemiology: Prevalence increases with age, rare before adolescence; female-­to-­male predominance.
b.	Etiology: Most common cause is Graves disease, followed by subacute thyroiditis. Less common causes are Hashitoxicosis, autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, factitious hyperthyroidism (intake
of exogenous hormone), TSH-­secreting pituitary tumor (rare), and
pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone. See Table 10.9 for comparison of Graves and Hashimoto disease.
c.	Laboratory findings: See Table 10.7. Further tests include TSH
receptor–stimulating antibody, thyroid-­stimulating immunoglobulin
(TSI), antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal (thyroid peroxidase)
antibodies.

2.	Thyroid storm21:
a.	Presentation: Acute onset of hyperthermia, tachycardia, and restlessness. May progress to delirium, coma, and death.
b.	Treatment: Admission to ICU. Emergent pediatric endocrinology
consultation recommended. Therapy aimed at relieving symptoms
(propranolol) and reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 (hydrocortisone), thyroid hormone production (antithyroid drugs), release
of hormone from thyroid gland (potassium iodide), and reabsorption
from enterohepatic circulation (cholestyramine).
3.	Neonatal thyrotoxicosis:
a.	Presentation: Microcephaly, frontal bossing, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), tachycardia, systolic hypertension leading to widened
pulse pressure, irritability, failure to thrive, exophthalmos, goiter,
flushing, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac
failure or arrhythmias. Onset from immediately after birth to weeks.
b.	Etiology: Occurs exclusively in infants born to mothers with Graves
disease. Caused by transplacental passage of maternal TSI.
Occasionally, mothers are unaware they have Graves. Even if a
mother has received definitive treatment (thyroidectomy or radiation
therapy), passage of TSI remains possible.
c.	Treatment and monitoring: Propranolol for symptom control.
Methimazole to lower thyroxine levels. Digoxin may be indicated for
heart failure. Disease usually resolves by 6 months of age.

III. PARATHYROID GLAND AND VITAMIN D22-­24
A. Parathyroid Hormone Function
1.	Increases serum calcium by increasing bone resorption
2.	Increases calcium and magnesium reuptake and phosphorus excretion
in the kidney
3.	Increases 25-­hydroxy vitamin D conversion to 1,25-­dihydroxy vitamin D,
in order to increase calcium absorption in the intestine
B. Distinguishing Between Abnormalities Related to Parathyroid
Hormone and Vitamin D
See Table 10.10.
C. Vitamin D Supplementation
Please see Chapter 21 for additional information.

IV. ADRENAL GLAND25-­29
A. Adrenal Insufficiency
1.	Causes of adrenal insufficiency:
a.	Impaired steroidogenesis, as in congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
b.	Adrenal destruction or dysfunction as in primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) (Addison disease), autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, or adrenoleukodystrophy.

markedly improves the predictive value. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003;88:5790–5794.

c.	Secondary AI caused by impaired circulating adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) due to hypothalamic or pituitary pathology.
d.	Acquired insufficiency secondary to long-­term corticosteroid use
leading to HPA suppression. NOTE: This is the most common cause
seen in clinical practice and may also occur in setting of chronic
high-dose inhaled corticosteroids.
2.	Laboratory findings in adrenal insufficiency:
a.	In primary AI, there is deficient mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid production. In central AI, there is only deficient glucocorticoid
production, and mineralocorticoid production is normal.
b.	Primary AI: Elevated ACTH, elevated plasma renin activity, low cortisol, low aldosterone, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia.
c.	Central AI: Normal/low ACTH, normal plasma renin activity (no
impairment of mineralocorticoid function), low cortisol, normal
aldosterone, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia.
d.	In infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),
17-­hydroxyprogesterone (17-­OHP) is increased (see Table 10.11 for
normal values by age).
3.	Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency:
a.	Initial screening with AM cortisol level, which may be drawn concomitantly with an ACTH level.
b.	See Table 10.12 for interpretation of AM cortisol results.

NOTE: No test for adrenal insufficiency has perfect sensitivity or specificity, so results must be
interpreted in the individual clinical context. Measurement of serum ACTH is also beneficial
(elevated in Addison’s, low/normal in secondary insufficiency).

c.	Plasma ACTH elevation >100 pg/mL with concomitant hypocortisolemia <10 ug/dL is consistent with glucocorticoid deficiency due
to primary AI.
d.	Standard dose ACTH stimulation test is used to confirm diagnosis.
4.	ACTH stimulation test:
a.	In brief, with ACTH deficiency or prolonged adrenal suppression,
there is an inadequate rise in cortisol after a single ACTH dose.
b.	See Box 10.1 for interpretation of ACTH stimulation test.
5.	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH):
a.	See Fig. 10.2.
b.	Group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a
defect in one of the enzymes required in the synthesis of adrenal
hormones.
c.	The enzymatic defect results in impaired synthesis of adrenal
steroids beyond the enzymatic block and overproduction of the
precursors before the block.
d.	21-­hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 90% of cases.
e.	Most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in females.

6.	Diagnosis of CAH on newborn screen:
a.	The test measures 17-­OHP and is 2% specific, resulting in a 98%
false-­positive rate due to artificial elevations from prematurity, sickness, stress.27
b.	If 17-­OHP is 40 to 100 ng/mL, repeat test.
c.	If 17-­OHP is higher than 100 ng/mL, obtain electrolytes and serum
17-­OHP. If evidence of hyperkalemia or hyponatremia, initiate treatment with hydrocortisone.
d.	In complete enzyme deficiency, adrenal crisis in untreated patients
occurs at 1 to 2 weeks of age due to salt wasting.
7.	Diagnosis of CAH outside of newborn period:
a.	Suspect partial enzyme deficiency if evidence of androgen excess
(premature adrenarche, hirsutism, irregular menses, acne,
advanced bone age).
b.	Morning 17-­OHP levels may be elevated.
c.	Diagnosis may require an ACTH stimulation test. A significant rise
in the 17-­OHP level 60 minutes after ACTH injection is diagnostic.
Cortisol response may be decreased.
8.	Addison disease30:
a.	Primary AI due to autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands.
b.	In children, it may be part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome
type 1 (APS-­1), which also includes hypoparathyroidism and
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
c.	Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease should also be
screened for other endocrinopathies (T1DM, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism).

10.	Stress dosing of steroids:
a.	Hydrocortisone and cortisone are the only glucocorticoids that
provide the necessary mineralocorticoid effects; prednisone and
dexamethasone do not.
b.	See Table 10.15 for calculation of moderate and major stress dose
steroid calculations.
c.	See Box 10.2 for rapid approximation of steroid dosing in the setting of acute adrenal crisis.
11.	Indications for stress dosing of steroids:
a.	“Stress” is defined as systemic infection, febrile illness, diarrheal
illness, trauma/fracture, burns, or surgery.
b.	Stress glucocorticoids should be given to patients:
(1) With known primary or secondary AI
(2) Following discontinuation of exogenous steroid (given for greater
than 2 weeks at doses greater than physiologic replacement)
until there is recovery of endogenous cortisol production (consider the need for 8am cortisol or ACTH stimulation test)
c.	Consider for hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation in patients
with suspicion for AI (even if not clinically diagnosed).
B. Adrenal Cortex Hormone Excess29
1.	Causes:
a.	Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome):
(1) Exogenous steroid use
(2) Excess cortisol secretion from the adrenals
(3) Excess ACTH production from ectopic ACTH producing tumor
(4) Excess ACTH production from a pituitary tumor (known as
Cushing disease)

b.	Hyperaldosteronism:
(1) Benign tumor of adrenal cortex (Conn syndrome)
(2) Overproduction by both adrenal glands (idiopathic
hyperaldosteronism)
(3) Rarely glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism
(4) Less common in children than hypercortisolism
(5) Lab findings include hypokalemia and hypernatremia
2.	Diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome31:
a.	Step 1: Demonstrate hypercortisolism with two separate measurements. Multiple screening tests are available; specificity increases
when they are used in combination:
(1) 24-­hour urine cortisol (>90 μg/24 hour consistent with
hypercortisolism).
(2) Midnight salivary cortisol level (>0.13 mCg/dL consistent with
hypercortisolism).
(3) Overnight low dose dexamethasone suppression test: Give 1 mg
dexamethasone at 11pm followed by an 8am serum cortisol the
next morning (normal suppression <1.8 mCg/dL).
b.	Step 2: Determine etiology of hypercortisolism (ACTH-­dependent vs.

B. Short Stature
1.	Definition:
a.	Short stature is height <2 SD below mean or <3rd percentile for age
and sex.
b.	Growth failure is defined as height <2 SD below mid-­parental height
or height velocity <10th percentile for age resulting in a downward
trend crossing height percentiles.
c.	Majority of children with short stature are healthy; true growth failure
is typically pathologic and requires evaluation.
2.	Determining etiology:
a.	See Table 10.20 for approach to differentiating between pathologic
and non-­pathologic causes of short stature.
b.	Bone age is determined by radiographs of left wrist and hand.
c.	See Fig. 10.3 for initial work up.
d.	A more extensive work-­up can be guided by history and physical
exam and could include:
(1) TTG and IgA (celiac disease)
(2) CBC with differential (anemia, malignancy, inflammation)
(3) CRP/ESR (inflammation, infection)
(4) CMP (renal/liver disorders, malnutrition, calcium disorders)
(5) TSH, free T4 (hypothyroidism)
(6) Karyotype or targeted gene testing (Turner syndrome, SHOX
mutation)
(7) IGF1, IGFBP-­3 [proxy measurements for growth hormone
(GH)]; IGFBP-­3 has a higher specificity in children <10); see
Table 10.21 and Table EC 10.C for normal values of IGF-­1 and
IGFBP-­3, respectively
3.	Indications for growth hormone use38:
The FDA has approved growth hormone for:
a.	Growth hormone deficiency
b.	Children born small-­for-­gestational-­age (SGA) who between 2 and 4
years of age have shown inadequate catch-­up growth or evidence of
normal growth velocity with height < 2.5 SD below mean

1.	For normal pubertal stages, please see Chapter 5.
2.	For definitions of precocious and delayed puberty, see Table 10.22.
B. Lab Evaluation
1.	LH, FSH, estradiol, and testosterone (free and total), see Tables 10.23–10.27
for normal values. NOTE: Early in puberty, LH production peaks overnight and
is lower during the day, so consider obtaining levels in the early morning.
2.	GnRH stimulation test46:
a.	Purpose: To evaluate for biochemical evidence of puberty when LH,
FSH, and sex hormone testing is inconclusive.
b.	Method: Give GnRH analog (Leuprolide) SQ, and measure LH and
FSH levels at 0 and 60 minutes.

254  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
c.	Interpretation: Prepubertal children should show no or minimal
increase in LH and FSH in response to GnRH. A rise of LH to >3.3 to
5.0 IU/L is evidence of central puberty.
3.	Delayed puberty41,45,47: See Fig. 10.4 for information on evaluation and
management of delayed puberty.
4.	Precocious puberty42,47: See Fig. 10.5 for information on evaluation and
management of precocious puberty.
C. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome48
1.	Clinical features in adolescents:
a.	Diagnostic criteria (must have features of both):
(1) Hyperandrogenism: Either clinical or biochemical
(a)	Clinical: Hirsutism, acne, male pattern alopecia
(b)	Biochemical characteristics: Elevated androgens including
DHEA-­S (see Table 10.28 for normal values), free or total
testosterone
(2) Menstrual abnormalities: Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea
(chronic anovulation).
NOTE: Appearance of multiple ovarian cysts is a diagnostic criterion for
adults, but not for adolescents, as this can be a normal finding in adolescent females.
b.	Common cause of female infertility.
c.	Often LH>FSH, but this is not required for diagnosis.
d.	Chronic anovulation and unopposed estrogen exposure increase risk
for endometrial cancer.
e.	Associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
2.	Management:
a.	Combined oral contraceptives: First-line for management of menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne. Increases SHBG (thus
decreasing free testosterone), which may result in increased insulin
sensitivity and restoration of ovulation.
b.	Anti-­androgen therapy, such as spironolactone, to treat hirsutism.
c.	Weight reduction and other lifestyle changes.
d.	Metformin: Can be considered as possible treatment if goal is to treat
insulin resistance.
D. Ambiguous Genitalia49
1.	Clinical findings in a neonate suspicious for ambiguous genitalia:
a.	Apparent female with clitoromegaly (length >1 cm or width >6
mm in term infant), inguinal or labial mass, or posterior labial
fusion.
b.	Micropenis (stretched penile length that is −2.5 SD below mean for

2.	Etiology:
a.	Due to undervirilization of male genitalia or virilization of female
genitalia
b.	Most common cause is CAH
c.	Other causes by male versus female karyotype:
(1) 46,XY karyotype: Testicular regression, androgen insensitivity,
testosterone biosynthesis disorders, rare forms of CAH, absence of
SRY
(2) 46,XX karyotype: SRY+, classical (21-­hydroxylase deficiency) or
more rare forms of CAH
(3) Other: Sex chromosome mosaicism (46,XY/46,XX, 46,XY/45,
XO, etc.)

258  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Evaluation:
a.	Labs: Timing of collection is important.
(1) Initial testing: LH, FSH, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT,
see Table EC 10.D), anti-­Müllerian hormone (AMH) and expedited determination of sex chromosomes (ask that resulting lab
rush results of sex chromosomes)
(2) After 36 hours of life: 17-­hydroxyprogesterone
(3) Daily electrolytes until salt-­wasting CAH is ruled out
(4) Further testing as needed to evaluate for more rare forms
of CAH: DHEA, 17-­hydroxypregnenolone, 11-­deoxycortisol,
­cortisol, ACTH
b.	Imaging: Options include genitogram (contrast study of the urogenital
sinus and internal duct structures) or voiding cysto-­urethrogram
(VCUG), pelvic and abdominal US, and pelvic magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to evaluate internal anatomy.
c.	Care should be taken to avoid premature gender/sex designation,
completion of birth certificate, and naming of infant.
E. Cryptorchidism50
1.	Epidemiology and clinical course:
a.	Can be present at birth (congenital) or after birth (acquired).
Congenital rate is 1% to 4.6% of males born >2.5 kg.
b.	Increased risk with preterm birth or low birthweight.
c.	About 1/3 to 1/2 of cryptorchid testicles descend spontaneously, usually by age 3 months.
d.	Neoplasm more common in males with cryptorchidism and may
occur in contralateral testis; early orchidopexy decreases risk of
malignancy.
e.	Males with bilateral cryptorchidism have higher risk for reduced
fertility.
f.	There is a higher risk of testicular torsion prior to repair.
2.	Evaluation:
a.	Providers should palpate testes for quality and position in all males at
each well child visit.
b.	Any phenotypic male newborn with bilateral, nonpalpable testes
should undergo evaluation for CAH with karyotype and hormonal
profile.
c.	In those without CAH, distinguish between cryptorchidism and
anorchia (absent testes) with serum Müllerian inhibiting substance
and consider additional hormone testing (inhibin B, FSH, LH, and
testosterone).
3.	Treatment: Observe for 6 months, at which time if testis remains undescended, referral to specialist recommended. Orchidopexy between 6
and 18 months of age recommended.

Chapter 10 Endocrinology  259

A. Definition
1.	Serum glucose level insufficient to meet metabolic requirements. For
practical purposes, value is defined as a point-­of-­care glucose (POCG)
<45 to 50 mg/dL within first 48 hours of life and <70 mg/dL beyond this
period.
NOTE: Bedside glucometer is a convenient tool to screen for hypoglycemia
but can be inaccurate by 10 to 15 mg/dL when in the range of hypoglycemia. STAT plasma glucose must be sent to establish diagnosis of
hypoglycemia.
B. Treatment Goals
1.	For neonates with suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder and
infants/children with confirmed hypoglycemia disorder, maintain plasma
glucose >70 mg/dL.
2.	For high risk neonates without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia
disorder, maintain plasma glucose >45 to 50 mg/dL for those <48 hours
of age and >60 mg/dL for those aged >48 hours.
C. Management
See Chapter 18.
D. Further Work-­up
1.	If serum glucose is consistently <70 mg/dL after 48 hours of life, at the
time of hypoglycemia (serum glucose <45 to 50 mg/dL via glucometer),
obtain STAT serum glucose, insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, free fatty
acids, and β-­hydroxybutyrate.
2.	Consider glucagon stimulation test: Administer glucagon and obtain
serum glucose levels Q10 min ×4. Repeat growth hormone and cortisol
levels 30 minutes after documented hypoglycemia.
E. Interpretation of Results
1.	A rise in glucose ≥30 mg/dL on glucagon stimulation test, along with
elevated plasma insulin levels >2 μU/mL (absence of detectable insulin
does not rule out hyperinsulinism, as insulin may be present below
the lower limit of detection of the assay), low serum levels of free
fatty acids (<1.5 mmol/L) and β-­hydroxybutyrate (<2 mmol/L), and a
persistent glucose requirement >8 mg/kg/min suggests a diagnosis of
hyperinsulinemia.
2.	Hypoglycemia with midline defects and micropenis in a male suggest
hypopituitarism, supported by low serum levels of growth hormone and
cortisol at the time of hypoglycemia.
F. Hyperinsulinemia
1.	Hyperinsulinemia is the most common cause of neonatal hypoglycemia beyond the first 7 days of life and may be congenital or transient.
2.	Congenital hyperinsulinism can be caused by dominant or recessive
mutations in genes responsible for regulating insulin secretion from
pancreatic β cells.

VIII. NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA EVALUATION51,52

260  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Transient hyperinsulinemia is commonly seen in infants of diabetic
mothers and less commonly in the setting of perinatal asphyxia and
intrauterine growth restriction.
4.	Long-­term management of persistent hyperinsulinism includes
diazoxide, which inhibits pancreatic secretion of insulin by keeping β-­cell ATP-­sensitive potassium channels open; however, it has
been rarely associated with pulmonary hypertension (black box
warning53).

I. INTRODUCTION
Intravenous fluids (IVFs) should be thought of as a medication by those who
prescribe them. Since the late 1950s, IVF choice has been largely guided by
Holliday and Segar’s estimations of sodium requirements. Using the electrolyte
composition of human milk, they calculated that the average child requires 3
mEq sodium (Na) and 2 mEq potassium (K) per 100 to 120 mL water (H2O).1
According to their calculation, basic solute needs can be met by administering ¼ normal saline (NS), a hypotonic fluid. While this estimation led to a
long-­standing tradition in pediatric maintenance IVF (MIVF) therapy, evidence
published over the past few decades culminated in new American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommending isotonic fluids as the maintenance
fluid of choice for the majority of hospitalized children.2

II. FLUID RESUSCITATION
A. Calculating Maintenance Fluid Volume
1.	The Holliday-­Segar method (Table 11.1 and Box 11.1) is the most
widely used method to approximate maintenance fluid volume. This
method estimates caloric expenditure in fixed-­weight categories and
assumes the average patient will require 100 mL of water for each 100
calories metabolized, with approximately 100 kcal burned per kg.1
2.	NOTE: The Holliday-­Segar method is not suitable for neonates <14 days
old, because it generally overestimates fluid needs in neonates. (See
Chapter 18 for neonatal fluid management.)
B. Calculating Fluid Loss
1.	Total body water (TBW) is equal to 60% of a child’s weight in kg (75%
in infants).3
EQUATION 11.1: TBWa = weight (kg) × 0.6
aTBW uses preillness weight; 1 L water = 1 kg water

2.	In a euvolemic child, 60% of TBW resides in the intracellular compartment [where potassium (K) concentration is 140 mEq/L and sodium
(Na) is negligible], and 40% of TBW is in the extracellular compartment
(where Na concentration is ∼140 mEq/L and K is negligible).4-­6
3.	The most precise method of assessing fluid deficit uses weight loss:
EQUATION 11.2: Fluid deficit (L) = preillness weight (kg) – illness
weight (kg)

5.	In a healthy child, insensible fluid volume loss is approximated as
⅓ of the Holliday-­Segar MIVF per day. NOTE: This calculation is
based on fluid requirements of healthy children. Many hospitalized children have increased insensible losses (e.g., secondary to
fever or increased respiratory rate) that must be factored into fluid
determinations.
C. Maintenance Fluid Choice in Hospitalized Children
1.	Based on a growing body of evidence, the AAP recommends
isotonic fluid as the most appropriate MIVF therapy for the vast
majority of hospitalized children between the ages of 28 days and
18 years. 2 See Table 11.3 for isotonic fluid options.
2.	Various disease states can lead to an increased secretion of antidiuretic
hormone (ADH), which promotes the retention of free water, leading to
hyponatremia.9,10 See Box 11.2 for examples.
3.	Exceptions exist in certain patient populations, such as children with neurosurgical disorders, congenital or acquired cardiac disease, hepatic disease,
cancer, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome,
diabetes insipidus, and voluminous watery diarrhea or severe burns.2
4.	See Table 11.3 and Table 11.4 for electrolyte composition of various
parenteral and enteral fluid replacement options.
5.	Unless hyperkalemia is present or the child is in renal failure, maintenance potassium requirements (20 mEq/L of fluid) should be given.11
Do not add potassium (K+) to fluids until urine output has been
established.12,13
D. Volume Replacement Strategy7,12,13
1.	Volume resuscitation and deficit replacement should generally be completed over 24 hours.
2.	See Table 11.5 for a three-­phase approach to fluid replacement.
3.	Children with isonatremic hypovolemia can be repleted with isotonic
fluid per AAP recommendations.2 See Box 11.3 for sample calculations
in isonatremic hypovolemia.
4.	If ongoing losses can be measured directly, they should be replaced 1:1
concurrently with maintenance fluid administration. If the losses cannot
be measured, an estimate of 10 mL /kg body weight for each watery
stool and 2 mL /kg body weight for each episode of emesis should be
administered.3 See Table 11.6 for electrolyte composition of certain
bodily fluids.
5.	Oral intake is the preferred method for repletion and maintenance, if
possible.
III. ELECTROLYTE MANAGEMENT
See Chapter 28 for age specific normal values of electrolytes.
A. Serum Osmolality and Tonicity2,7,14
1.	Fluids can be expressed in terms of their tonicity and their osmolality.

2.	Serum osmolality (285 to 295 mOsm/kg) is a measure of both permeable
and nonpermeable solutes and is calculated using the following equation:
glucose (mg / dL)
18

+

BUN (mg / dL)
2.8

3.	Osmolality is measured as osmoles per weight (kg) versus osmolarity,
which is measured as osmoles per volume (L).
4.	Tonicity is effective osmolality. It is the net force on water across a semipermeable membrane (e.g., the cell membrane) based on the osmotic
pressures. It is relative and determined largely by sodium content.
Substances that flow freely across membranes, such as urea, are ineffective osmoles and influence osmolality but not tonicity.
B. Sodium
The equations within this section are theoretical and are not validated. They
offer a starting point for calculation of electrolyte abnormalities, but clinical
context is ALWAYS of the utmost importance and frequent monitoring is
necessary. Children with neurosurgical disorders, cardiac disease, hepatic
disease, cancer, kidney disease, diabetes insipidus, and severe burns may
require consultation with subspecialists before fluid choice and volume is
administered. When correcting dysnatremias, frequent lab monitoring (∼2 to
4 hours) is indicated with adjustment of fluid type and rate as needed.

× TBW (L)
aThis represents the excess sodium deficit in hyponatremic dehydration. It

must be added to the daily sodium requirement for hospitalized patients of
∼14 mEq/100 mL fluid given.
(2) Hyponatremia should be corrected by no more than 10 to 12
mEq per 24 hr to avoid rapid change of serum sodium, which
can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome.6,13,15

(3)	Witnessed onset of hyponatremia over the course of hours does
not pose as great of a risk and can be corrected in a similar
amount of time that it developed.7
(4) If central nervous system (CNS) symptoms are present, hypertonic saline (HTS) should be administered over 3 to 4 hours to
correct the hyponatremia by ∼5 mEq/L.5,6,11 Use Equation 11.7
to determine rate of HTS.
(5) To determine the sodium content of the fluid necessary for repletion:
EQUATION 11.6:

Na content (mEq / L) =
[Na deficit + (14 mEq / 100 mL × maintenance fluid volume [ mL])
volume deficit a
aUse daily maintenance volume requirements if euvolemic

(6) Once the fluid type is determined, the starting rate can be calculated using the following:
Na deficit ( mEq) × 1000 mL
infusate Na ( mEq) × hours IVF will run in a day

(7) See Box 11.4 and 11.5 for sample calculations in hyponatremic
dehydration.
2.	Hypernatremia: Excess free water loss (Na >145 mEq/L)
a.	Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis (Table 11.8)
b.	Management
(1) Hypernatremic hypovolemia occurs in scenarios in which free
water is either unavailable/restricted or there is excessive loss of
solute-­free water (see Table 11.8).
(2) Hypernatremia is dangerous because of complications from potential
treatment sequelae, the most serious of which is cerebral edema.4,7
(3) Plan to correct the serum Na by no more than 10 mEq/24 hours
and correct the free water deficit over 48 hours to minimize the
risk of cerebral edema.4,10,11,16
(4) As with hyponatremia, witnessed onset of hypernatremia over
the course of hours can be corrected rapidly; this is because the
brain has not had time to produce idiogenic osmoles to adapt to
the change in osmolality.7,11
(5) Expert opinion recommends starting with D5 ½ NS.16 However,
the sodium and fluid needs can also be calculated.

Initial Fluid Resuscitation Strategy to Avoid Rapid Sodium Correction when Serum
Na+ >175 mEq/L16
Example: A 3-­kg (preillness-­weight) breastfed neonate appearing severely dehydrated with
serum sodium 185 mEq/L and hemodynamic instability
Resuscitation with normal saline (NS) may drop the serum Na+ too quickly. Plan to simultaneously run NS and 3% hypertonic saline (HTS), given rapidly together (i.e., over 5 minutes),
to effectively give resuscitation fluid with a concentration no more than 15 mEq/L below the
child’s serum Na+. Repeat the boluses as needed to achieve hemodynamic stability.

Note: In clinical practice, one will often not have laboratory data available quickly enough
to employ this strategy. However, severe hypernatremia should be suspected in the clinical
scenario of a solely breastfed neonate who appears severely dehydrated.16 STAT labs should be
sent, and this strategy may be employed as soon as laboratory values are available.

by 0.8 mg/dL.
ii. pH: Acidosis increases ionized calcium.
iii. Symptoms of hypocalcemia refractory to calcium supplementation
may be caused by hypomagnesemia.

a.	Respiratory acidosis: PCO2 > 45 mm Hg
b.	Metabolic acidosis: Arterial bicarbonate < 20 mmol/L

I. GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES
A. Gastrointestinal Bleeding
1.	Presentation: Blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs in
four ways: hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, and occult bleeding.
2.	Differential diagnosis of GI bleeding: Table 12.1
3.	Diagnosis/Management
a.	Assess airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic stability.
b.	Perform full physical exam, verify bleeding with rectal examination,
and testing of stool or emesis for occult blood. Notable exam findings
include abdominal tenderness, guarding, rebound, hepatosplenomegaly, perianal skin tags, or fissures.
c.	Obtain baseline laboratory tests. Complete blood cell count (CBC),
coagulation studies, type and screen, reticulocyte count, complete metabolic panel (CMP), C-­reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and assess for disseminated intravascular coagulation (d
dimer, fibrinogen).
d.	If concerned for hemodynamic instability, begin initial fluid resuscitation. Consider transfusion if there is continued bleeding, symptomatic
anemia, and/or a hematocrit level <21%. Initiate intravenous (IV) proton
pump inhibitor (PPI).
e.	Further evaluation and therapy based on the assessment and site of
bleeding:
(1) Upper GI Bleeding: Consider esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(EGD) and testing for Helicobacter pylori.1
(2) Lower GI Bleeding: Consider abdominal radiograph, upper GI
study (± small bowel follow-­through), air-­contrast barium enema,
colonoscopy, Meckel scan, tagged red cell scan, computed
tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE).
Consider stool cultures, stool ova and parasites, Clostridium difficile toxin, and stool calprotectin.
B. Acute Abdomen2
1.	Definition: Severe abdominal pain that may require emergency surgical
intervention.
2.	Differential diagnosis: Table 12.2
3.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Course and characterization of the pain, emesis, melena,
hematochezia, diet, stool history, fever, travel history, menstrual 283

b.	Physical Exam: Rashes, arthritis, and jaundice. Abdominal tenderness on palpation, rebound/guarding, rigidity, masses, distention,
or abnormal bowel sounds, rectal examination with stool hemoccult
testing, pelvic examination (discharge, masses, adnexal/cervical
motion tenderness), and genital examinations.
c.	Labs: CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, lactate, type and screen,
urinalysis, amylase, lipase, gonorrhea/chlamydia testing, β-­human
chorionic gonadotropin (β-­hCG), ESR, and CRP.
d.	Imaging: Two-­view abdominal radiographs to assess for obstruction,
constipation, free air, gallstones, and kidney stones. Consider chest
radiograph to evaluate for pneumonia, abdominal/pelvic ultrasonography, and abdominal CT with contrast or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).
4.	Management: Ensure patient is NPO and begin IV hydration.
Consider nasogastric decompression, serial abdominal examinations,
surgical/gynecologic/GI evaluation, pain control, and antibiotics as
indicated.
II. CONDITIONS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
A. Vomiting
1.	Definition: Forceful oral expulsion of gastric contents can be bilious or
nonbilious.
2.	Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.3

12

CNS, Central nervous system; DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis; GI, gastrointestinal; GU, genitourinary.

286  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Diet, medications, timing (acute vs. chronic), exposures,
character (bilious, bloody, projectile) and associated symptoms. Pay
special attention to vomiting without concomitant diarrhea.
b.	Physical Exam: HEENT and neurologic exam with specific attention
to mucus membranes, skin and dentition, as well as a thorough
abdominal exam.
c.	Labs: Although not always necessary, consider CMP, CBC, UA, β-­
hCG, and lipase.
d.	Imaging: Plain abdominal radiograph with upright view (to rule out
obstruction or free air), abdominal ultrasound (US), upper GI series.
Consider neurologic imaging if indicated.
4.	Management: Hydration. Gastric decompression if GI obstruction
suspected. Antiemetic therapy can be used in the acute setting, avoid
chronic use (see Chapter 22 for discussion of antiemetic therapy).
Consider surgical consultation if the vomiting is bilious.
B. Gastrointestinal Reflux Disease3
1.	Definition: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is physiologic passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD) is defined as troublesome symptoms or complications of GER.
2.	Differential Diagnosis: Dysmotility including achalasia, gastroparesis,
ileus, and obstruction. Inflammatory conditions such as esophagitis,
gastritis/dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease. Anatomic abnormalities such
as Zenker diverticulum, tracheoesophageal fistula, vascular ring, pyloric
stenosis. Functional disorders including abdominal migraines and cyclical vomiting syndrome. Food allergies/intolerance in infants.
3.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Recurrent regurgitation, choking, vomiting, heartburn, chest
pain, dysphagia, stridor or wheezing, cough, recurrent aspiration
pneumonia, dental erosions, and sleep disturbances. In infants,
GERD may present as irritability, weight loss, feeding refusal, or
Sandifer syndrome. History is typically sufficient for diagnosis and to
initiate management.
b.	Testing: Esophageal pH monitoring and esophageal impedance
monitoring if diagnosis unclear.4
4.	Management:
a.	Lifestyle: A prone or left-­sided sleeping position and elevation of head
of bed may improve GER symptoms in older children, but current
studies for infants have been inconclusive. Infants up to 12 months
should continue to sleep supine—risk of sleep-­related infant death far
outweighs benefit of prone or lateral sleeping in GERD. After feeds,
infants should be kept upright and a trial of smaller more frequent
feeds may be beneficial. Avoidance of second-­hand smoke exposure.
b.	Diet: Milk-­thickening agents can be beneficial for symptom relief.
If severe and unresponsive to conservative management, consider
2-­to 4-­week trial of extensively hydrolyzed protein formula in infants

or elimination of cow’s milk in maternal diet to eliminate milk protein
sensitivity as a cause of unexplained vomiting.
c.	Pharmacotherapy: Medication is not recommended for “happy spitters” or infants with uncomplicated GER. Both PPIs and H2 receptor
antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in relieving symptoms and promoting mucosal healing.5 There is insufficient evidence to support routine use of prokinetic therapies (metoclopramide and erythromycin).
C. Eosinophilic Esophagitis6,7
1.	Definition: A chronic, immune/antigen-mediated disease characterized
by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction with ≥15 eosinophils/highpower field (hpf) on esophageal biopsy.
2.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Dysphagia, food impaction, chest pain, food refusal or
intolerance, GER symptoms, emesis, abdominal pain, and failure to
thrive. Majority of patients with EoE have concurrent atopic disorder.
b.	Diagnosis: EGD with esophageal biopsies demonstrating at least 15
eos/hpf histoligically with chronic symptoms of esophageal dysfunction;
Must evaluate for other causes or contributions to esophageal eosinophilia. Importantly histologic evidence without clinical correlation is not
diagnostic. Per the AGREE conference, a PPI trial is no longer needed
for diagnosis. Consider obtaining allergy testing (see Chapter 15).
3.	Management8:
a.	Dietary therapy: 6-food elimination diet (milk, wheat, eggs, soy, peanuts/tree nuts, seafood), elemental diet, or targeted elimination diet
determined by allergy testing.
b.	Pharmacotherapy: Topical swallowed steroids delivered via inhaler are
preferred as first line therapy to induce remission with limited side
effects (6- to 8-week course of fluticasone or budesonide metereddose inhaler administered orally without a spacer). PPI therapy can
also be trialed for initial treatment. Systemic steroids for short-term
use (e.g., dysphagia leading to dehydration or weight loss). No current evidence to support routine use of biologics.
c.	Complications: Symptomatic strictures requiring esophageal dilation.
D. Celiac Disease9
1.	Definition: An immune-­mediated inflammatory enteropathy caused by
sensitivity to dietary gluten and related proteins (wheat, barley, and rye)
in genetically susceptible individuals.
2.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Presentation can be variable, and some patients are asymptomatic. Most common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, constipation, distention, and failure to thrive. Non-­GI symptoms
include rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), osteoporosis, short stature,
delayed puberty, and iron deficiency anemia that is resistant to oral iron.
Increased occurrence in children with autoimmune disorders, Down
syndrome, Turner syndrome, William syndrome, immunoglobulin A (IgA)
deficiency, and in first-­degree relatives of those with celiac disease.

12

Chapter 12 Gastroenterology  287

288  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
b.	Labs: First line screening is IgA antibody to human recombinant
tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and serum IgA. If known selective IgA
deficiency with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease, testing with
TTG IgG is recommended. CBC, iron studies, hepatic function panel,
thyroid tests, calcium, and vitamin D are recommended. Additional
antibody testing may be necessary for inconclusive clinical scenarios.
c.	Procedures: Biopsy is “gold standard” for diagnosis. Intestinal biopsies showing villous atrophy supports diagnosis. Results dependent
on adequate consumption of gluten prior to testing; ensure 6 to 8
weeks of gluten ingestion prior to endoscopy.
3.	Management: Lifetime, gluten-­free diet. Annual screening with TTG is
recommended to monitor adherence to diet.
4.	Complications: More often seen in adulthood but at risk for vitamin deficiencies and other autoimmune disorders. Higher risk of non-­Hodgkin
lymphoma, specifically enteropathy associated T-­cell lymphoma.
E. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (EoE)10,11
1.	Classification:
a.	Crohn disease: Transmural inflammatory process affecting any
segment of the GI tract, most commonly terminal ileum. Commonly
presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, and poor
growth.
b.	Ulcerative colitis (UC): Chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of
the colon and rectum. Commonly presents with rectal bleeding and
diarrhea.
2.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, lethargy, nausea,
vomiting, malnutrition, psychiatric symptoms, arthropathy, and
rashes. Family history, exposure to infectious agents, or antibiotic
treatment.
b.	Physical Exam: Stomatitis, perianal skin tags, fissures, and
fistulas. Assessment of hydration and nutritional status. Fever,
orthostasis, tachycardia, abdominal tenderness, distention,
or masses suggests moderate to severe disease and need for
hospitalization.
c.	Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to
be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may serve as
a sensitive, noninvasive test.12 IBD often associated with anemia,
hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Stool studies to exclude infectious process are necessary.
d.	Imaging: MRE is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of
pediatric IBD due to high diagnostic accuracy and no radiation
exposure. CT and fluoroscopy are other alternative strategies if MRE
unavailable.
e.	Procedures: Diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies used to confirm
diagnosis.

3.	Management13-­16:
a.	Induction of remission:
(1) Crohn: Exclusive enteral formula-­based nutrition (80%–100%
caloric need by liquid formula), 5-­aminosalicylates, antitumor
necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and, if indicated, antibiotics or
surgery. Corticosteroids can be used if necessary.
(2) UC: Corticosteroids, 5-­aminosalicylates, TNF agents, and if indicated, antibiotics or surgery. Therapy guided by severity of illness.
b.	Maintenance of remission: Immunosuppression includes thiopurines,
methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and anti-­TNF monoclonal
antibodies. Avoid prolonged steroid use.
c.	Other: Surgical intervention indicated only after medical management
has failed in both Crohn’s disease and UC. In Crohn disease, surgery
is indicated for localized disease (strictures), abscess, or disease
refractory to medical management.
F. Constipation17
Normal stooling patterns by age: Infants 0 to 3 months, 2 to 3 bowel movements/day (breastfed infants may stool after every feed or go 5 to 7 days
with no stool); 6 to 12 months, 1.8/day; 1 to 3 years, 1.4/day; >3 years, 1/
day. If an exclusively breastfed <1 month old is not stooling regularly, it may
be a sign of insufficient milk intake; monitor weight gain.
1.	Definitions:
a.	Constipation: Delay or difficulty in defecation for 2 or more weeks.
Functional causes of constipation are the most common. History and
physical exam are often sufficient for diagnosis.
(1) Functional: Consider Rome IV Criteria (Table EC 12.A)
(2) Nonfunctional: See Table 12.4 for differential diagnosis.
2.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Age of onset, toilet training experience, frequency/consistency/size of stools, pain or bleeding with defecation, presence of
abdominal pain, soiling of underwear, stool-­withholding behavior,
change in appetite, abdominal distention, allergies, dietary history,
medications, developmental history, psychosocial history. Refer to
Bristol Stool Form Scale for classification of stool history (Fig. 12.1.
Delayed meconium, poor weight gain or weight loss, anorexia,
nausea, vomiting, and family history (e.g., thyroid disorders, cystic
fibrosis) would warrant further evaluation for nonfunctional causes.
b.	Physical Exam: External perineum, perianal examination. Fecal
impaction may be palpated on abdominal or digital rectal examination. Plain abdominal single view radiography can be considered
when physical examination is unreliable.
3.	Management of functional constipation: Box 12.1 and Table EC 12.B.
a.	Disimpaction:
(1) Oral/Nasogastric Approach: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions
are effective for initial disimpaction. May also use other osmotic
laxatives.

MANAGEMENT OF CONSTIPATION
HOME CLEANOUT INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: Take a stimulant laxative (bisacodyl, senna) with 8 oz of liquid, as per dosing instructions
below. This should be done 6 hr prior to intended effect.
Step 2: Drink polyethylene glycol (PEG). Mix with water or another clear noncarbonated liquid. Drink
full amount in 2 hr. See below for dosing instructions.
Step 3: 1–2 hr after finishing PEG, should begin passing formed/thick brown stool. The stool should
become thinner and clearer stooling continues.
Step 4: If not stooling or passing very thick stools 4 hr after the PEG is finished, drink 1 capful of
PEG in 8 oz of liquid every hour until stools are clear.
Step 5: Cleanout is finished when stool is mostly clear with very little sand-­like material mixed in.

DAILY MAINTENANCE THERAPY
The day after colon cleanse, the patient should begin taking maintenance daily PEG for continued
management of constipation.
Advise patient/family to mix PEG in clear noncarbonated drink or water at least once daily. See
formulary for dosing. Advise to drink the entire solution in 30 min or less for it to work well. It is
best to give the PEG after school and before dinner. Do not give PEG right before bedtime.
The goal of daily maintenance PEG is for the child to have 1 or 2 soft and easily passable bowel
movements every day.
Advise to have child to sit on the toilet after every meal or whenever they feel the need to stool.

(2) Rectal approach: Saline or mineral oil enemas effective. Avoid
enemas in infants, glycerin suppositories may be used in infants
less than 1 year.
b.	Maintenance therapy (usually 3 to 12 months): Goal is to prevent
recurrence.
(1) D
 ietary changes: Evidence supporting dietary intervention is
weak; however, increased intake of fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, and fluids other than milk is recommended.
(2) B
 ehavioral modifications: Regular toilet habits with positive reinforcement. Referral to a mental health specialist for motivational
or behavioral concerns if soiling an issue.
(3) M
 edications: Daily PEG. Lactulose as second line treatment. The
use of stimulant laxatives and stool softeners may also be considered. Avoid prolonged use of stimulant laxatives. Discontinue
therapy gradually only after return of regular bowel movements
with good evacuation. Evidence does not support use of probiotics.
c.	Special considerations in infants aged <1 year: 2 to 4 oz of 100%
fruit juice (e.g., prune or pear) recommended in younger infants.
Glycerin suppositories may be useful. While use is off label, PEG is
routinely used in children <1 year of age. Avoid mineral oil, stimulant
laxatives, and phosphate enemas.
G. Diarrhea18
1.	Definition: Acute diarrhea is more than three loose or watery stools per
day. Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea lasting more than 2 to 4 weeks.
2.	Pathogenesis: It can be infectious or malabsorptive with an osmotic or
secretory mechanism.
a.	Osmotic diarrhea: Water is drawn into intestinal lumen by maldigested osmotic compounds, as seen in celiac disease, pancreatic
disease, or lactose intolerance. Stool volume depends on diet and
decreases with fasting (stool osmolar gap ≥100 mOsm/kg).
b.	Secretory diarrhea: Water accompanies secreted or unabsorbed electrolytes into the intestinal lumen (e.g., excessive secretion of chloride
ions caused by cholera toxin). Stool volume is increased and does
not vary with diet (stool osmolar gap <50 mOsm/kg).
c.	Stool osmolar gap: The standard value is 290 mOsm/kg.19
Stool osmolar gap =
Stool Osm − {2× [stool (Na) mEq/L + stool (K) mEq/L]}

3.	Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.5
4.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: acute vs. chronic, travel history, recent antibiotic use, and
immune status.
b.	Labs: CMP, CBC, stool hemoccult testing, stool culture, C. difficile
toxin, ova and parasites, and viral antigens (see Chapter 17 for common bacterial and viral pathogens).

5.	Management
a.	Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)20: Enteral hydration has proven
superior in reducing the length of hospital stay and adverse events.21
Parenteral hydration is indicated in severe dehydration, hemodynamic instability, or failure of ORT.
b.	Diet: Restart regular diet as soon as tolerated.
c.	Pharmacotherapy: No supporting evidence for use of nonspecific
antidiarrheal agents, antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide), antisecretory drugs, and toxin binders (e.g., cholestyramine). Consider
evidence-­based antimicrobial therapy for infectious diarrhea (see
Chapter 17). If malabsorptive (e.g., celiac disease or IBD), therapy
should be tailored to disease process.
d.	Probiotics22: Evidence supporting use of probiotics is limited;
however, their efficacy has been demonstrated in the following circumstances: antibiotic-­associated diarrhea, mild to moderate acute
diarrhea, C. difficile diarrhea (severe recurrent disease only), hepatic
encephalopathy, the prevention of atopic dermatitis, and possibly
preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.23

3.	Biliary system: bilirubin (total and direct), urobilinogen, γ-­
glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phosphatase.
B. Acute Liver Failure24,25
1.	Definition: Laboratory evidence of liver injury with no known history of
chronic liver disease, the presence of coagulopathy not corrected by
vitamin K administration, and an INR >1.5 if patient has encephalopathy or >2.0 if patient does not have encephalopathy.
2.	Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.7
3.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, irritability, confusion, drowsiness,
skin changes, medications, ingestion, illicit drug use, family history,
developmental delay, transfusion history.
b.	Physical Exam: Neurologic status, skin exam, hepatosplenomegaly,
nutritional status, growth, bruising, petechiae. Slit lamp exam if
concern for Wilson disease. Findings of chronic liver disease include
clubbing, palmar erythema, cutaneous xanthoma, ascites, and
prominent abdominal vessels.
c.	Labs: Liver synthetic/metabolic function, liver cell injury, and biliary
system tests (see earlier). BMP, magnesium, phosphorus, CBC with
peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, ammonia, lipase. Factors V,
VII (depleted first in ALF), VIII, and fibrinogen. A urine toxicology
screen and a serum acetaminophen level should be obtained (see
Chapter 3). Viral hepatitis studies, autoantibodies, and evaluation for
metabolic syndromes must be considered.
NOTE: See Chapter 17 for interpretation of serologic markers of
hepatitis B.

Infection

296  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
d.	Imaging: Abdominal US with Doppler flow. Consider head CT scan to
exclude hemorrhage/edema, and chest radiography.
e.	Procedures: Liver biopsy
f.	Management: Evaluate for underlying cause. Consider intensive care
unit (ICU) level care with close monitoring of mental status, fluid
balance, metabolic disturbances, hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, and
coagulopathies. Cerebral edema is life-­threatening and may require
intracranial pressure monitoring. Consider liver transplant when
indicated.
C. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease26
1.	Definition: Chronic liver disease from excessive fat accumulation in the
liver, often secondary to insulin resistance and obesity. Most common
liver disease in children in the United States.
2.	Diagnosis: Screen between 9 and 11 years for obese children and
overweight children with risk factors. ALT is the recommended test. If
ALT persistently elevated >2 times upper limit of normal for >3 months,
further evaluation is warranted. Must exclude alternative etiologies.
3.	Management: Extensive lifestyle modifications, well-­balanced healthy
diet. No medications have proven benefit. Bariatric surgery can be considered if severe comorbidities. Screen for diabetes and other comorbid
conditions.
D. Hyperbilirubinemia27-­29
1.	Definition: Bilirubin is the product of hemoglobin metabolism. There
are two forms: direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated).
Hyperbilirubinemia is usually the result of increased hemoglobin load,
reduced hepatic uptake, reduced hepatic conjugation, or decreased
excretion. Direct hyperbilirubinemia is defined as a direct bilirubin
>20% of the total bilirubin or a direct bilirubin of >2 mg/dL.
2.	Differential Diagnosis: Table 12.8
3.	Management: Dependent upon etiology. Evaluation and diagnosis should
be guided by history; however, liver laboratory studies (see earlier) and
USs are warranted in many patients. Refer to Chapter 18 for evaluation
and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
IV. PANCREATITIS30-­32
Definition: Inflammatory disease of the pancreas.
A. Acute Pancreatitis33
1.	Diagnosis:
a.	History: Abdominal pain, irritability, epigastric tenderness, nausea
and vomiting. Multiple etiologies (Table 12.9). Per INSPPIRE criteria,
diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of the following:
(1) A
 bdominal pain compatible with acute pancreatitis
(2) S
 erum amylase and/or lipase values >3 times upper limit of normal
(3) Imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis

I. METABOLISM1-­7
A. Clinical Presentation of Metabolic Disease (Box 13.1)
1.	Metabolic disease can be conceptualized into broad categories (Table 13.1).
2.	When considering a particular diagnosis, a complete patient history,
including details of conception, pregnancy, prenatal screening and
diagnostic studies, delivery, postnatal growth, development, and a three-­
generation family history in the form of a pedigree (Fig. EC 13.A) should
accompany a comprehensive physical examination. The family history
may be remarkable for close relatives who died of similar presentations
(may be mistaken for “sepsis” or “SIDS”).
3.	A high index of suspicion is required, as routine investigations may be
unrevealing.
4.	Routine newborn screening (see Section II) is meant to detect many
metabolic disorders before onset of clinical symptoms, but the conditions tested for vary by state and not all countries test, so clinical suspicion should remain high if clinical picture is concerning.
B. Evaluation
1.	Initial laboratory tests: Comprehensive metabolic panel, blood glucose,
venous blood gas (VBG), ammonia (beware false-­positives from tourniquets, struggling children, or sample delay), lactate, creatine kinase
(CK), complete blood cell count with differential, urine ketones.
2.	Subsequent evaluation for metabolic disease:
a.	Consult a geneticist.
b.	A basic metabolic work-­up includes plasma amino acids (PAA), urine
organic acids (UOA), acylcarnitine profile, quantitative (free and
total) plasma carnitine, lactate/pyruvate ratio. Further specialized
biochemical testing is available.
3.	Additional labs given specific circumstances:
a.	Metabolic acidosis: Ammonia, lactate, b-­hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, UOA, urinalysis with urine pH, acylcarnitine profile, quantitative
(free and total) plasma carnitine (Fig. 13.1).
b.	Hyperammonemia: VBG, UOA, PAA, acylcarnitine profile, urine orotic
acid (Fig. 13.2).

Overwhelming illness in the neonatal period
Vomiting
Acute acidosis, anion gap
Massive ketosis
Hypoglycemia
Coagulopathy
Coma
Seizures, especially myoclonic
Hypotonia
Unusual odor of urine
Extensive dermatosis
Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia
Family history of siblings dying early

Intoxication disorders
Toxic accumulation of small molecules upstream of a defective enzyme.
Tend to present early in life with nonspecific symptoms that may
include recurrent vomiting, irritability, lethargy progressing to coma,
organ dysfunction. Symptoms may wax and wane with intercurrent
illness.
Disorders of reduced fasting tolerance
Disorders in the body’s ability to tolerate fasting, with early onset of
hypoglycemia. Can present in infancy or later when trying to sleep
through the night, including morning symptoms or seizures. Look for
laboratory abnormalities and symptoms not usually found in typical
fasting.
Disorders of complex molecules
These disorders have a broad phenotypic spectrum and typical
biochemical screening can be unrevealing. Features can be present
at birth and/or slowly progressive affecting multiple organ systems.
Often enzymatic and/or broad molecular genetic testing is needed.
Mitochondrial disorders
Defect in energy production through the electron transport chain. There
is a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, often involving high-­
energy organs including brain, muscle, and/or heart.

2.	A general guiding principal is to provide hydration and enough glucose
to meet the patient’s caloric needs to stop catabolism.
a.	Use D10% + electrolytes for age at 1.5 to 2 times maintenance rate.
b.	Use caution in mitochondrial disorders (and do not use D10 in
pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency), because this may enhance lactic
acidosis. If uncertain, measure lactate and acid-­base status regularly.
3.	For unknown/suspected metabolic disease, treatment should not be
delayed during work-­up.

mg/kg/day added to a 24-­hour supply of formula or divided at least 4
times daily and consult a biochemical geneticist.10

II. NEWBORN METABOLIC SCREENING7
A. Timing
1.	First screen should be performed within the first 48 to 72 hours of life
(at least 24 hours after initiation of feeding).
2.	Second screen (requested in some states) should be performed after 7
days of age.
3.	Preterm infants: Perform initial screen at birth (to collect sample
before transfusions), another at age 48 to 72 hours, a third at age 7
days, and a final at age 28 days or before discharge (whichever comes
first).
B. Abnormal Result
1.	Requires immediate follow-­up and confirmatory testing; consult a
geneticist.
2.	ACT Sheets and Confirmatory Algorithms are available for more information on how to proceed with specific abnormalities: https://www.acmg.

A. History
Pertinent history includes pregnancy course, prenatal exposures, type of
conception (natural or assisted), perinatal history, developmental milestones, and review of systems.
B. Family History
1.	Three-­generation pedigree focused on both medical and developmental
histories (see Fig. EC 13.A).
2.	Helpful mnemonics include:
a.	SIDE mnemonic15: Anything SIMILAR in the family? Anything
INHERITED through the family? Any premature, unexplained
DEATHS? Any EXTRAORDINARY events?
b.	SCREEN mnemonic16: SOME CONCERNS about conditions running
in the family? REPRODUCTION—any issues with pregnancy infertility, or birth defects? EARLY disease, death, or disability? ETHNICITY?
NONGENETIC—any other risk factors?
c.	Rule of Too/Two13:
(1) 	Too: tall? short? many? few? early? young? different?
(2) 	Two: cancers? generations? in the family? birth defects?
3.	Patterns of inheritance: See Online Content for discussion of different
patterns of inheritance.
C. Physical Examination
1.	Major anomalies: Structural anomalies that are found in less than 5% of
the population and may cause significant cosmetic or functional impairment, often requiring medical or surgical management.
2.	Minor anomalies11,12,14,17: Structural anomalies that are found in greater
than 5% of the population with little or no cosmetic or functional significance to the patient.
3.	Examples of major and minor anomalies (Table 13.7). Three or more
minor anomalies may be a nonspecific indicator of occult or major
anomaly.
D. Work-­up
1.	Imaging to evaluate for major anomalies
a.	Head ultrasound (US) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
b.	Echocardiogram
c.	Complete abdominal US
d.	Skeletal survey with radiographs composed of: AP views of skull,
chest/ribs, upper extremities and hands, lower extremities and feet;
lateral views of skull, complete spine, chest, and odontoid view.
2.	Dilated eye exam
3.	Hearing evaluation
4.	Genetic testing: See Fig. 13.4 and Table 13.8. The patient should be
referred to genetics for a dysmorphology evaluation and appropriate
testing.

IV. PATTERNS OF DYSMORPHOLOGIC CONDITIONS11,14
This section is not comprehensive; it covers some common reasons to seek
a genetics consult. These conditions will often be managed by a multidisciplinary team.
A. Cardiac Disorders
1.	Congenital heart disease: Investigation for co-­occurring anomalies with
abdominal US. Chromosome microarray testing indicated, including for
22q11 deletion syndrome. Table 13.9.
2.	Cardiomyopathy: Can be from inborn errors of metabolism, channelopathies, mutations in genes important for sarcomere and desmosome
production/function, or other single gene disorders.
3.	Long QT disorders: Many single gene disorders.
B. Ciliopathies
1.	Nonmotile ciliopathies: Defects in primary (nonmotile) ciliary function.
Cystic renal disease, brain malformations (molar tooth sign), retinal

dysplasia, obesity. Examples: Cystic kidneys as a result of heritable
polycystic kidney disease; neurodevelopmental ciliopathies such as
Joubert syndrome or Bardet-­Biedl syndrome.
2.	Primary ciliary dyskinesias: Defects in motile cilia. Recurrent respiratory
infections (chronic sinopulmonary disease), infertility, situs inversus.
Examples: More than 30 genes known to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia.
When situs inversus is present, it is referred to as Kartagener syndrome.
3.	Evaluation: Evaluation for potentially affected organ systems, including abdominal US, echocardiogram, brain MRI, and complete retinal
evaluation with ophthalmology. Skeletal survey if limb defects. CMP to
evaluate kidney and liver function. Unless a specific disorder suspected,
broad genetic testing is appropriate.
C. Cleft Lip and Palate (CLP)
1.	Can be isolated or part of a syndrome.
2.	Risk factors: Maternal smoking, heavy alcohol use, systemic corticosteroid use, folic acid and cobalamin deficiency.18
3.	Submucosal clefts may be indicated by a bifid uvula.
4.	Evaluation: Children can have difficulties with feeding, speech, and hearing
(chronic otitis or hearing loss as part of a syndrome). If not an isolated anomaly, may need further work-­up with ophthalmology and echocardiogram.

5.	Examples: Autosomal dominant inheritance seen in Van der Woude syndrome (associated with lip pits) and Stickler syndrome (can have retinal
detachment, hearing loss).
D. Connective Tissue Disorders
1.	Consider when a patient has velvety skin, hyperextensible joints,
abnormal scarring, poor healing, striae, pectus deformities, tall stature,
myopia, lens dislocations, arachnodactyly.
2.	Evaluation: Some connective tissue disorders are associated with dilated
aorta (echocardiogram), dysplastic vessels, or fragility of lens/retina
(ophthalmology evaluation).
3.	Examples: Dilated aorta with characteristic physical features in Marfan
syndrome; vascular fragility in vascular Ehlers-­Danlos (type IV); isolated
hyperextensibility of joints in hypermobile Ehlers-­Danlos (type III).
E. Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability
1.	All children should be offered genetic evaluation.
2.	See Chapter 9 for information on evaluation.
3.	Examples: Microarray is first tier test because it can detect microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, such as 1p36 deletion
syndrome. FMR1 repeat testing can detect fragile X syndrome and
heterozygous females, who can also have developmental delays.
Further testing may be indicated to detect monogenic causes, such as
Kleefstra syndrome.

F. Deafness, Hard of Hearing
1.	Approximately 60% of hearing loss is genetic. It can be syndromic or
nonsyndromic.
2.	Consider perinatal infectious causes (e.g., cytomegalovirus).
3.	Evaluation: Consider connexin 26 and 30 gene testing as first step if
nonsyndromic and/or broad gene panel testing. Individualize inner ear/
brain imaging. Ophthalmology assessment, ECG, and renal US should
be done for those with negative connexin testing.
4.	Examples: Approximately half of nonsyndromic hearing loss is from
GJB2 (encodes connexin 26) gene mutations. Syndromic causes
include Usher syndrome, which can also have gradual blindness.
G. Hypotonia
1.	Central: Abnormalities of brain function, normal strength or axial weakness,
preserved/persistent newborn reflexes, normal CK, normal muscle bulk.
a.	Evaluation: CK to differentiate. Evaluate for causes such as hypothyroidism (TSH); evaluate brain structure and function with MRI and
EEG.
b.	Examples: Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-­Willi syndrome,
peroxisomal disorders.
2.	Peripheral: Alert, profound weakness that is often appendicular, absent
reflexes, feeding difficulties, normal or increased CK.
a.	Evaluation: Evaluate for causes such as hypothyroidism (TSH) or
mitochondrial disease (lactate/pyruvate). Electromyography (EMG) to
determine if muscle or nerve affected. Consider that cardiac muscle
could be affected (echocardiogram).
b.	Examples: Spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, muscular
dystrophies.
H. Limb and Stature Disorders
1.	Can be defects in collagen formation, bone formation, or remodeling.
2.	Evaluation: Radiographic skeletal survey of all bones to localize dysplasia. Some disorders, including achondroplasia, can have narrowing at
the foramen magnum or cervical instability (flexion/extension C-­spine
films). There can be a risk of central or peripheral sleep apneas (sleep
study). Karyotype for females with short stature to evaluate for Turner
syndrome. Unless a specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing
is appropriate.
3.	Examples: Rhizomelic limb shortening and narrow foramen magnum
seen in achondroplasia. Cervical instability seen in COL2A1 gene mutations (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Stickler syndrome). The
presence of multiple congenital joint contractures is called arthrogryposis, which is seen in many disorders. Fractures can be seen in
osteogenesis imperfecta and hypophosphatasia.
I. Liver Disease
1.	Liver failure and/or direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia can be
a manifestation of a metabolic disorder or the result of a genetic
syndrome.

13

Chapter 13 Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology   317

318  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
2.	Evaluation: Metabolic work-­up including PAA, UOA, urine succinylacetone, very-­long-­chain fatty acids, urine reducing substances. Some
syndromes have ocular features (ophthalmology evaluation). Unless a
specific disorder suspected, broad genetic testing is appropriate.
3.	Examples: Cholestasis found in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (type 1, 2, and 3). Liver dysfunction can be seen in tyrosinemia.
Indirect/unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen in Gilbert and
Crigler-­Najjar syndromes.
J. Oncologic Disorders19
1.	Approximately 9% of pediatric oncology patients have a heritable cancer
predisposition syndrome or germline mutation. This puts them and
affected family members at risk for certain cancers and may affect their
individualized treatments.
2.	Obtain a thorough family history with specific cancer diagnoses and age
of diagnosis.
3.	Evaluation: Many cancers warrant referral. Genetic testing is tailored to
each specific diagnosis. Examples include myelodysplastic syndrome,
medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, sarcomas, pituitary
blastoma, and many more.
4.	Examples: Early onset of cancers in Li-­Fraumeni syndrome (especially sarcoma) and von Hippel-­Lindau syndrome (especially
hemangioblastoma).
K. Overgrowth
1.	Generalized overgrowth can result in macrosomia at birth or height and/
or head circumference greater than the 98th percentile.
2.	Hemihypertrophy of a limb may be the result of mosaicism from somatic
changes.
3.	Be aware that certain overgrowth syndromes have associated cancer
risks and may require routine monitoring (e.g., abdominal US screening
in Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome).
4.	Evaluation: Disorder-­specific genetic testing based on exam findings;
may require skin biopsy. In some disorders, internal organs can be
affected (echocardiogram, ECG, renal US).
5.	Examples: Generalized overgrowth with developmental delays can be the
result of Sotos syndrome, Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome, or others.
Segmental overgrowth/hemihypertrophy can result from somatic PIK3CA
mutations affecting the brain (MCAP syndrome) or a limb (Klippel-­
Trénaunay syndrome).
L. Seizure Disorders
1.	Consider genetics especially with positive family history, intractable
epilepsy, infantile onset, developmental regression, intellectual disability,
dysmorphic features, autism, or brain malformations.
2.	Can be the result of metabolic conditions or syndromic disorders.
3.	Increased recurrence risk in families even if no genetic cause identified.
4.	Evaluation: Consideration of microarray, epilepsy panels, or whole
exome sequencing (particularly if dysmorphic features present);

consider biochemical testing for inborn errors of metabolism; physical
exam with Wood’s lamp for cutaneous manifestations (e.g., hypopigmented macules).
5.	Examples: Sodium channel defects (SCN1A mutations) can lead to a
broad spectrum of seizures. Accompanying dermatologic findings can
be characteristic for neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis.
M. Skin Pigmentation Alterations
1.	Can be the result of post-­zygotic mosaicism. As a result, genetic variants
may only be detectable in affected skin and not in blood.
2.	Skin and the central nervous system are derived from the same neural
crest lineage; many skin pigmentation anomalies have associated central nervous system abnormalities, including malformations or seizures.
Often referred to as neurocutaneous disorders.
3.	Evaluation: Examination with a Wood’s lamp, ophthalmology evaluation
4.	Examples: Multiple café-­au-­lait macules seen in neurofibromatosis
type 1 and Legius syndrome. Genetic mosaicism in skin can lead to a
pigmentation pattern called hypomelanosis of Ito.
N. Vascular Anomalies
1.	Can involve arterial, vascular, and lymphatic systems. Can be caused by
germline mutations or postzygotic somatic changes (mosaicism). Some
are associated with segmental overgrowth.
2.	Vascular syndromes can cause clinically significant arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin, internal organs, and
brain/spine.
3.	Evaluation: Examine mucosal membranes. Some disorders require
evaluation for intraorganal arteriovenous malformations with abdominal
US and/or MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of brain and
spine. Several disorders are autosomal dominant—obtain family history
for vascular lesions.
4.	Examples: Autosomal dominant history of multiple capillary malformations could be from RASA1 mutations. Port-­wine stains seen in Sturge-­
Weber syndrome. Telangiectasias on lips, nose, and hands seen in
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

V. ETIOLOGIES OF DYSMORPHIC FEATURES (FIG. 13.5)11,14,29
A. Aneuploidy
Abnormal number of chromosomes.
1.	Aneuploidy syndromes are most commonly due to maternal nondisjunction and more rarely due to chromosomal translocation or mosaicism.
Risk increases with maternal age.
2.	The evaluation for aneuploidy often begins prenatally with a first trimester screen (nuchal translucency, nasal bone, free β-­human chorionic
gonadotropin [β-­hCG], PAPP-­A) or circulating cell-­free fetal DNA analysis showing increased risk.

13

Chapter 13 Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology   319

320  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Prenatal diagnostic testing options include chorionic villus sampling in
the first trimester or amniocentesis during or after the second trimester.
4.	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be performed in the first
24 to 48 hours of life to indicate number of chromosomes but will not
determine the morphology of the chromosomes (e.g., if a translocation
is present). Therefore karyotype analysis is still indicated in aneuploidy
syndromes, both to provide a diagnosis and to provide accurate genetic
counseling.
5.	Specific aneuploidy syndromes:
a.	Down syndrome (Trisomy 21):
(1)	
Features: Hypotonia and characteristic facial features (brachycephaly, epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridge, upward-­slanting palpebral fissures, Brushfield spots, small mouth and ears), excess
skin at the nape of the neck, single transverse palmar crease,
short fifth finger with clinodactyly, wide gap between the first and
second toes. Intellectual disability present in all, but severity is
variable.
(2)	Full health supervision guidelines from the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) are available (see Section VII).
(3)	In brief: In addition to karyotype, neonates should have echocardiogram to assess for congenital heart disease, ophthalmologic
evaluation to assess for cataracts, hearing screen, complete blood
count (CBC) to assess for transient myeloproliferative disease,
thyroid studies to assess for hypothyroidism, and referral to early
intervention services. Annual thyroid studies, CBC (add ferritin
and CRP for any child at risk of iron deficiency), hearing and
vision assessments. Cervical spine x-ray at age 3 years if asymptomatic (sooner imaging with immediate neurosurgical referral if
symptomatic). Monitor for signs of obstructive sleep apnea and
neurologic dysfunction.
b.	Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18):
(1)	
Features: Intrauterine growth restriction and polyhydramnios,
small for gestational age at birth, clenched hands with overlapping fingers, hypoplastic nails, short sternum, prominent occiput,
low-­set and structurally abnormal ears, micrognathia, rocker-­
bottom feet, congenital heart disease, cystic and horseshoe
kidneys, seizures, hypertonia, significant developmental and
cognitive impairments.
(2)	Ninety percent die before 1 year of life.

severe developmental disability, low-­set malformed ears, cleft lip
and palate (CLP), microphthalmia, aplasia cutis congenita, polydactyly (most frequently of the postaxial type), narrow hyperconvex nails, apneic spells, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects.
(2)	Ninety-­five percent die before 6 months of life.

d.	Turner syndrome (45, X):
(1)	
Features: Short stature, gonadal dysgenesis with amenorrhea and
lack of a pubertal growth spurt, broad chest with hypoplastic or
inverted nipples, webbed neck. The diagnosis should be considered prenatally in a female fetus with hydrops, increased nuchal
translucency, cystic hygroma, or lymphedema. Intelligence is
usually normal, but patients are at risk for cognitive, behavioral,
and social disabilities.
(2)	Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see
Section VII).
(3)	In brief: Obtain baseline echocardiogram, renal US, ophthalmology and audiology evaluations. Routine thyroid testing, biochemical liver tests, HgbA1C, vitamin D, TTG and immunoglobulin A
(IgA), audiology, skin examinations, bone mineral density, and
skeletal assessments.
e.	Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY; 48, XXYY; 48, XXXY; and 49, XXXXY):
(1)	
Features: Primary hypogonadism, which may present in infancy
with hypospadias or cryptorchidism or in adolescence/adulthood
with infertility, gynecomastia, and small testes. Children may have
expressive language delay.
(2)	There is an increased risk of breast carcinoma in 47, XXY.
(3)	Testosterone therapy is indicated at puberty for hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.
B. Copy Number Variation (Deletions and Duplications)
Partial loss or additional copies of genetic material on part of a
chromosome.
1.	22q11 Deletion syndrome (Velocardiofacial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome)
a.	Features: Congenital heart disease (tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted
aortic arch, ventricular septal defect [VSD], and truncus arteriosus
most common), palatal abnormalities (velopharyngeal incompetence,
cleft palate), characteristic facial features in approximately two-­
thirds, developmental delays, learning disabilities, immunodeficiency,
hypocalcemia, feeding problems, renal anomalies, hearing loss,
laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies, growth hormone deficiency,
autoimmune disorders, seizures (with or without hypocalcemia), and
psychiatric disorders.
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Microarray; FISH is no longer recommended.
Assessments should include serum calcium, absolute lymphocyte
count, B-­and T-­cell subsets, renal US, chest x-­ray, cardiac examination, and echocardiogram.
c.	Health supervision: Health supervision recommendations have been
published. Hold live vaccines until immune function is assessed.
2.	5p− Syndrome (Cri-­du-­chat syndrome)
a.	Features: High pitched cry, delayed development, intellectual disability, microcephaly, low birth weight, hypotonia, hypertelorism, low

13

Chapter 13 Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology   321

322  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
set ears, small jaw, round face, congenital heart disease (VSD, atrial
septal defect [ASD], PDA).
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Can be detected on karyotype or microarray.
3.	1p36 Deletion syndrome
a.	Features: Developmental delay, intellectual disability, delayed growth,
hypotonia, seizures, speech delay, hearing and vision impairment,
microcephaly, low ears with thick helices, congenital heart disease
(structural defects or cardiomyopathy).
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Microarray.
C. Disorders of Methylation/Epigenetics
Heritable changes that affect gene activity and expression.
1.	Prader-­Willi syndrome
a.	Features: Severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy, followed by an insatiable appetite in later infancy or early childhood.
Developmental delays in motor and language abilities. All affected
individuals have some degree of intellectual disability. Short stature
is common; males and females have hypogonadism, and in most,
infertility.
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Results from missing paternally contributed
region. Methylation testing can detect almost all individuals—whether
due to abnormal paternal-­specific imprinting, a paternal deletion, or
maternal uniparental disomy within the Prader-­Willi/Angelman critical
region of 15q. Follow-­up with further molecular testing.
c.	Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the
AAP are available (see Section VII). Monitor for feeding difficulties in infancy and close supervision beginning in childhood to
prevent obesity. Evaluate for and treat hypothyroidism, sleep
apnea (central and obstructive), central adrenal insufficiency,21
and cryptorchidism.
d.	Treatment: Growth hormone can be beneficial, and hormone replacement therapy can aid in sexual development.
2.	Angelman syndrome
a.	Features: Happy demeanor, hand-­flapping, and fascination with
water. Severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe
speech impairment, gait ataxia, tremulous limbs, hypotonia, microcephaly, and seizures.
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Results from missing maternally contributed
region. Methylation testing can detect almost all individuals—whether
due to abnormal maternal-­specific imprinting, a maternal deletion, or
paternal uniparental disomy within the Prader-­Willi/Angelman critical
region of 15q. Some individuals can be detected through UBE3A
sequence analysis.
c.	Health supervision: Monitor for seizures, behavior problems, feeding
issues, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, strabismus, constipation, and
gastroesophageal reflux disease.

d.	Treatment: Antiepileptic drugs for seizures; be careful not to overtreat, because Angelman syndrome also associated with movement
abnormalities (avoid carbamazepine, vigabatrin, and tiagabine).22
Speech therapy with a focus on nonverbal communication. Sedatives
for nighttime wakefulness.
3.	Classic Rett syndrome: X-­linked disease present only in females because
pathogenic MECP2 variants are most often lethal in males who have
only one X chromosome. Males who do survive with MECP2 mutations
have presentation different from Rett syndrome that often incudes
neonatal encephalopathy.
a.	Features: Neurodevelopmental syndrome that presents after 6 to 18
months of typical development with acquired microcephaly, then
developmental stagnation, followed by rapid regression. Gait ataxia
or inability to ambulate, repetitive, stereotypical handwringing, fits of
screaming or inconsolable crying, episodic breathing abnormalities
(sighing, apnea, or hyperpnea), tremors, and generalized tonic-­clonic
seizures.
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Molecular testing of MECP2.
c.	Health Supervision: Regular ECG to evaluate QT interval,23 monitor
for scoliosis.
D. Repeat Expansion
Pathogenic expansion of trinucleotide repeats during DNA replication.
1.	Fragile X syndrome
a.	Most common cause of inherited intellectual disability.
b.	Features: Males have relative macrocephaly and prominent ears.
Postpubertal macroorchidism and tall stature that slows in adolescence. Females have a range of intellectual disability due to
the degree of X inactivation of the affected chromosome. Female
premutation carriers (55 to 200 repeats) can develop primary ovarian
insufficiency; males with 55 to 200 repeats can have a tremor/ataxia
phenotype.
c.	Diagnostic evaluation: Repeat expansion testing of FMR1 gene to
assess number of CGG trinucleotide repeats (typically >200 in fragile
X syndrome).
d.	Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP
are available (see Section VII). Symptom and supportive psychopharmacologic medications.
2.	Other examples include Huntington disease (CAG repeats), myotonic
dystrophy (CTG repeats), and Friedrich ataxia (GAA repeats).
E. Mendelian/Single Gene Disorders
Mutation in a single gene causing a disorder.
1.	Marfan syndrome
a.	Features: Myopia, ectopia lentis, aortic dilatation with predisposition
to rupture, mitral valve prolapse, pneumothorax, bone overgrowth
and joint laxity, pectus carinatum or excavatum, scoliosis, pes
planus.

13

Chapter 13 Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology   323

324  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical diagnosis based on the revised Ghent
criteria (a “systemic score” system based on clinical features that can
support a diagnosis if score is greater than or equal to 7). Molecular
genetic testing of FBN1 gene.
c.	Health supervision: Annual ophthalmologic examination; annual echocardiography; intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with computed
tomography (CT) or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood. Avoid
contact sports, competitive sports, isometric exercise. Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP are available (see Section VII).
d.	Treatment: β-­blocker (atenolol) and/or an angiotensin-­II type 1 receptor blocker (losartan) is current standard of care. Valve-­sparing surgery to replace aortic root when diameter exceeds ∼4.5 cm in adults
(or if rates of aortic dilation exceed ∼0.5 cm/year) and significant
aortic regurgitation is present.24
2.	Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome (EDS)
a.	Features: Smooth, velvety, hyperextensible skin, widened scars, poor
healing, easy bruising, joint hypermobility with recurrent dislocations,
chronic joint or limb pain, and a positive family history. The vascular-­
type EDS is distinct and involves translucent skin, characteristic
facies (pinched nose), as well as risk for arterial, intestinal, and
uterine fragility or rupture.
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical evaluation and family history. For classical and vascular types, echocardiogram and DNA testing. Vascular
type additionally needs MRI/MRA imaging of aorta and iliac arteries.
Joint hypermobility can be scored with Beighton criteria. No known
genetic cause of hypermobile type.
c.	Treatment: Physical therapy to improve joint stability, low-­resistance
exercise, and pain medications as needed; treat gastroesophageal
reflux. Vascular EDS requires management in a clinic specializing in
connective tissue disorders.
3.	Achondroplasia
a.	Features: Short arms and legs (especially rhizomelia); bowing of the
lower legs; large head with characteristic facial features including frontal
bossing and midface retrusion. Infantile hypotonia is typical, followed
by delayed motor development. Gibbus deformity of the thoracolumbar
spine leads to exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Rarely, children have hydrocephalus and restrictive pulmonary disease. Stenosis at the foramen
magnum in infancy increases the risk of death; lumbar spinal stenosis
may present in childhood but is more common in adulthood. Intelligence
and lifespan are usually normal. Average adult height for males and
females is approximately 4 feet.
b.	Diagnostic evaluation: Clinical diagnosis based on characteristic physical exam. FGFR3 mutation testing available if diagnostic uncertainty.
c.	Health supervision: Full health supervision guidelines from the AAP
are available (see Section VII). In brief: Use standard growth charts
for achondroplasia. Baseline head CT including cervicomedullary
junction in infancy, and precautions against uncontrolled head

Chapter 13 Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology   325
movement or neck manipulation. Monitor for signs of obstructive
sleep apnea, middle ear complications (e.g., otitis media), or spinal
stenosis (more common in adults).
F. Teratogen Exposure (Table 13.10)
G. In utero Forces25
1.	Uterine compression:
a.	Can be intrinsic (oligohydramnios, multiple fetuses, uterine deformities) or extrinsic (small pelvis).
b.	Results in deformations, including craniofacial (plagiocephaly, flattened facies, crumpled ear, craniosynostosis), extremities (dislocated
hips, equinovarus or calcaneovalgus feet, tibial bowing, contractures), torticollis, lung hypoplasia, scoliosis.

VI. CONSENT AND DISCLOSURE OF GENETIC TESTING
A. Ethics of Genetic Testing in Pediatrics
Genetic testing in pediatric patients poses unique challenges given that children require proxies (most often parents) to give consent for testing. Several
publications and statements have been made with regard to genetic testing
in children, including the “Ethical Issues with Genetic Testing in Pediatrics”
statement made by the AAP.26 Important considerations include:
1.	Testing and screening of a pediatric patient should be in his/her best
interest and provide clear benefits.
2.	If testing is performed for the interests of parents or other family members, it should not be to the detriment of the child.
3.	Treatment and/or follow-­up must be available after testing is sent.
4.	Carrier testing or screening in children and adolescents is not broadly
supported.
5.	Predictive testing for late-­onset disorders is discouraged until a patient
is able to make an autonomous decision; in these cases, extensive pre-­
test counseling is recommended.
B. Informed Consent
Pretest counseling and informed consent are important prior to sending any
genome-­wide testing and documentation of informed consent is recommended. Possible results from genetic testing include:
1.	Positive—a causative/related variant is found.
2.	Negative—either no causative/related variant is present, or the available technology or scope of the test methodology was unable to detect
the causative/related variant. A negative result does not guarantee the
condition does not have a genetic etiology.
3.	Variant(s) of uncertain significance—variants for which the meaning is
uncertain (could be variants without clinical significance or related to
the patient’s presentation but not previously reported).
4.	Incidental finding(s)—variants anticipated to affect the patient’s health
that are unrelated to the indication for sending the test (and may be an
adult-­onset condition).
5.	Discovery that parents are blood relatives and/or nonmaternity/nonpaternity.
C. Professional Disclosure of Familial Genetic Information
Pretest counseling should include the discussion that genetic testing may
have implications for family members. With regard to disclosure of genetic
testing results to at-­risk family members when a patient or family member
chooses not to disclose, the provider must weigh the duty to respect privacy
and autonomy of the patient with the duty to prevent harm in another
identifiable person. The ethical and legal duties of the physician are not well

Chapter 13 Genetics: Metabolism and Dysmorphology   327
defined. The American Society of Human Genetics released a statement
on professional disclosure of familial genetic information which outlines
“exceptional circumstances,” which if all are present, disclosure may be
permissible: (1) attempts to encourage disclosure by the patient have failed,
(2) harm is “highly likely” to occur, (3) the harm is “serious and foreseeable,”
(4) either the disease is preventable/treatable, or early monitoring will reduce
risks, (5) the at-­risk relative(s) are identifiable, and (6) the harm of failure to
disclose outweighs the harm that may result from disclosure.27
D. Disclosure of Incidental Findings
Patients are sometimes given the option to be informed of any incidental or
secondary findings when they pursue genetic testing, but in general, it is recommended that incidental findings should be reported when there is strong
evidence of benefit to the patient. The minimal list of reportable incidental
findings may be found in the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)
March 2013 statement and related updates.28

c.	An affected couple (each being a carrier) has a 25% chance of having an affected child, a 25% chance of having an unaffected child,
and a 50% chance of producing a carrier of the condition with each
pregnancy.
3.	X-­linked:
a.	Because females have two X chromosomes and males have only one
X chromosome, males are more commonly and more severely affected
by X-­linked conditions. Females can be unaffected or have a spectrum
of manifestations. In carrier females, lyonization is the process of
silencing one X chromosome in each cell and “unfavorable lionization”
can result in a large proportion of cells that inactivated the normal X
chromosome, and as a result clinical features are present.
b.	Females have a 50% chance of passing on an affected X to each
male or female child. Males will pass on the affected X to all female
children and will have unaffected sons.
4.	Mitochondrial:
a.	Classically a matrilineal inheritance pattern, caused by mitochondrial
DNA inherited from one’s mother that contributes to mitochondrial
function. Sons will be affected but cannot pass the condition on to
their offspring.
b.	There may be significant phenotypic variability due to “heteroplasmy,” in which the relative proportion of affected and unaffected
mitochondria may change as cells divide.
c.	Mitochondrial disease is currently known to be caused by either variants in mitochondrial DNA or by recessive variants in nuclear genes
that code for proteins that function in the mitochondria.
5.	Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy:
a.	The two alleles of a gene may be functionally equivalent but may
be expressed or silenced depending on the parent of origin of the
chromosome. This is due to the presence of epigenetic machinery
influencing the expression of genes and resulting in different methylation patterns.
b.	Uniparental disomy is a rare occurance in which offspring have
inherited both copies of a chromosome from one parent. There are
two types: (1) Uniparental isodisomy is an error in meiosis II, in

327.e2  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
which the offspring receives two identical copies of a chromosome
from one parent. This can result in autosomal recessive disorders
because any variant on one parental allele could be present on both
alleles of their offspring. (2) Uniparental heterodisomy is an error
in meiosis I, in which the offspring receives both copies of a single
parent’s chromosome. This can result in disorders of imprinting
because only one parent contributed to the epigenetic pattern of that
chromosome.

I. ANEMIA
A. Screening for Anemia
1.	The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening
between 9 and 12 months with a repeat level in 6 months.
2.	Screen yearly in high-­risk children: history of prematurity or low birth
weight, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding without supplemental
iron beyond 4 months, diet without iron-­fortified cereals or foods naturally rich in iron, feeding problems, poor growth, inadequate nutrition.1
B. Definition of Anemia
1.	Anemia is defined as a reduction in hemoglobin (Hb) two standard
deviations below the mean, based on age-­specific norms.
2.	See Table 14.1 at the end of the chapter for age-­specific blood cell indices.
C. Causes of Anemia
1.	See Fig. 14.1 for approach to anemia based on red blood cell (RBC) production, as measured by reticulocyte count and cell size. Note that normal
ranges for Hb and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are age-­dependent.
2.	See Tables 14.2 and 14.3 for more details regarding specific causes of
nonhemolytic and hemolytic anemia.
D. Evaluation of Anemia
1.	Useful equations in the evaluation of anemia:
a.	Mentzer index2 = MCV/RBC
(1)	Index >13 suggests iron deficiency anemia (IDA).
(2)	Index <13 suggests thalassemia trait.
(3)	Sensitivity: 62% for IDA, 86% for beta thalassemia trait.
Specificity: 86% for IDA, 62% for thalassemia.
b.	Reticulocyte index = % reticulocytes × patient hematocrit/normal hematocrit3
(1)	>2 is indicative of increased RBC production in appropriate
response to anemia.
(2)	<2 is evidence of hypoproliferative anemia.
2.	Other useful indices and tests
a.	RBC distribution width (RDW):
(1)	Normal in thalassemia.
(2)	Increased in IDA and sideroblastic anemia.
b.	Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): Hb/hematocrit (Hct):
(1)	Allows for classification of anemia as hypochromic, normochromic, or hyperchromic.

Maternal antibodies to incompatible fetal RBC antigens (Rh, A, B)
causes hemolytic disease in utero and in neonatal period.
Diagnosis: Mild anemia to hydrops fetalis, early jaundice.
Treatment: Intensive phototherapy, exchange transfusion.
Inheritance: 75% AD. 25% spontaneous mutation or AR.
Protein defect → membrane instability → RBC destruction via
extravascular hemolysis.
Diagnosis: Family history with clinical suspicion and spherocytes
on smear, osmotic fragility test, EMA flow cytometry if unclear
clinical picture.
Treatment: Folate supplementation if moderate-­severe hemolysis,
anticipatory guidance, splenectomy (for severe disease),
­cholecystectomy if needed for symptomatic cholelithiasis.
Inheritance: Typically AD.
Diagnosis: Elliptocytes on smear.
Treatment: Same as for hereditary spherocytosis.
Inheritance: X-­linked disorder.
Enzyme deficiency predisposes to intravascular hemolysis with
oxidative stress (e.g., with infections/illness, fava beans,
medications).
Diagnosis: G6PD assay when well (may be falsely elevated immediately after hemolytic episode).
Treatment: Avoid oxidative triggers (see drug/chemical list),
transfuse for severe anemia.
Inheritance: AR disorder of PKLR or PKM genes causes chronic
hemolysis.
Diagnosis: Measure PK activity in RBC.
Treatment: Transfuse if symptomatic. Consider splenectomy if
severe transfusion-­dependent anemia.

336  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
E. Management of Anemia
1.	Iron deficiency anemia
a.	Oral iron (ferrous sulfate)
(1)	Empirically treat children with microcytic anemia and history of
poor dietary iron.5
(2)	In anemia of chronic disease, only use iron supplementation if
evidence of absolute iron deficiency and ferritin <100 ng/mL.5
(3)	After initiation of iron supplementation, expect reticulocyte count
to increase within the first week with a 1 g/dL increase in Hb in 4
weeks (if severe anemia with Hb <9 g/dL, a response should be
seen in 2 weeks).1
b.	Iron transfusion (low molecular weight iron dextran6 or iron sucrose7)
is appropriate for children with iron malabsorption (PPI use, short
bowel syndrome, primary malabsorption), poor response to oral
iron therapy, inability to tolerate oral iron therapy, and hemodialysis-­
dependent patients receiving erythropoietin.
2. Sickle cell anemia
a.	Etiology: Caused by a genetic defect in β-­globin that leads to polymerization and sickling with deoxygenation, leading to hemolysis, adherence to blood vessel endothelium, and vaso-­occlusive ischemia.
b.	Most common subtypes: HbSS (sickle cell anemia) and HbSβ0
(sickle-­β0-­thalassemia) are most severe. HbSC (sickle-­hemoglobin C
disease) and HbSβ+ (sickle-­β+-­thalassemia) are often milder.
c.	Diagnosis: Often made on newborn screen with Hb electrophoresis. The
sickle preparation and Sickledex are rapid tests that are positive in all
sickle hemoglobinopathies. False-­negative test results may be seen in
neonates and other patients with a high percentage of fetal Hb.
d.	Complications: See Table 14.5. A hematologist should be consulted.
e.	Acute management of anemia in sickle cell disease8:
(1)	RBC exchange transfusions: Indicated for patients with symptomatic severe acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, intractable
pain crisis, intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatic sequestration,
refractory priapism, and multisystem organ failure. Also indicated for children with prior stroke or transcranial Doppler reading >200 cm/sec.8 Replace with HbS-­negative cells. Follow Hct
carefully with goal Hct <30% to avoid hyperviscosity.9
(2)	Do not transfuse for asymptomatic anemia, acute kidney injury,
or recurrent splenic sequestration.
f.	Chronic management and health maintenance8: See Table 14.6.
Ongoing consultation and clinical involvement with a pediatric hematologist and/or sickle cell program are essential.
3.	Thalassemia
a.	Etiology: Defects in α-­ or β-­globin production leads to precipitation
of excess chains, causing ineffective erythropoiesis and shortened
survival of mature RBCs.

b.	α-­Thalassemia:
(1)	Silent carriers (α−/αα): Not anemic; Hb electrophoresis usually
normal.
(2)	
α-­Thalassemia trait (α−/α−) or (αα/−): Causes mild microcytic
anemia from birth; Hb electrophoresis usually normal. Hb Barts
can be seen in infancy (e.g., on state newborn screens) in
patients with α-­thalassemia trait.
(3)	HbH disease (β4) (α−/−−): Causes moderately severe anemia
from birth; HbH (β-­tetramer) may be seen on newborn screen
and subsequent electrophoresis.
(4)	Hb Bart/hydrops fetalis (−−/−−): Hb Barts (γ4) cannot deliver
oxygen; usually fatal in utero or in neonatal period.
c.	β-­Thalassemia: Ineffective erythropoiesis is more severe in β-­thalassemia
than α-­thalassemia. Patients often develop more severe iron overload
from increased enteral absorption and transfusions. Adult Hb electrophoresis with decreased Hb A, increased Hb A2, and increased Hb F.
(1)	Thalassemia trait/thalassemia minor (β/β+) or (β/β0): Mildly
decreased β-­globin production. Usually asymptomatic with mild
anemia.
(2)	Thalassemia intermedia (β+/β+): Markedly decreased β-­globin
production. Presents at about 2 years of age with moderate compensated anemia (Hb 7 to 10 g/dL). Wide variability in presentation that may include features noted as follows.
(3)	Thalassemia major/Cooley anemia (β0/β0, β+/β0, or β+/β+):
Minimal to no β-­globin production. Presence of anemia within first
6 months of life requiring regular transfusions. Overstimulation of
bone marrow, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron overload results
in jaundice, growth failure, hypersplenism, gallstones, skeletal
abnormalities, liver cirrhosis, and cardiac impairment.
d.	Management10
(1)	Patients with thalassemia major are transfusion dependent.
Patients with thalassemia intermedia may need occasional
transfusions.
(2)	Transfuse every 3 to 5 weeks for goal pretransfusion Hb 9 to
10.5 mg/dL.
(3)	Goal posttransfusion Hb <14 to 15 g/dL due to risk of hyperviscosity and stroke.
(4)	Treat iron overload with chelation (deferoxamine), which should
be initiated in thalassemia major after 10 to 20 transfusions or
when ferritin >1000 μg/L.
(5)	Bone marrow transplant is curative.

II. NEUTROPENIA
A. Definition of Neutropenia
1.	Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
<1500/μL. Severe neutropenia is defined as an ANC <500/μL.

2.	See Table 14.7 at the end of the chapter for age-­specific leukocyte differentials.
3.	Repeat CBC 2 to 3 weeks later to determine if transient (e.g., secondary
to a medication, infection) or persistent.11
B. Causes and Evaluation of Neutropenia11
1.	CBC +/− blood smear should be obtained to evaluate neutrophil morphology and concurrent presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia.
2.	If pancytopenic, obtain bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with
cytogenetics.
3.	If persistent neutropenia for more than 2 to 4 weeks, consider further
workup based on potential etiologies (Table 14.8).
C. Management of Neutropenia
1.	Additional diagnostic testing:12
a.	Repeat CBC 2×/week for 6 to 8 weeks for cyclic neutropenia.
b.	Reticulocyte Index to differentiate between destructive processes and
marrow failure.
c.	Blood smear for morphologic abnormalities.
d.	Immunologic testing (Coombs test, anti-­double-­stranded DNA, antineutrophil antibody) for autoimmune or alloimmune processes.
e.	IgG, IgA, IgM, lymphocyte subtypes for immunodeficiency.
2.	Treatment:
a.	Myeloid-­specific cytokine granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor
(G-­CSF; filgrastim).
(1)	Indications for continuous use: Severe congenital neutropenia, cyclic
neutropenia, glycogen storage disease 1b, bone marrow failure (e.g.,
aplastic anemia, Schwachman Diamond-­Oski syndrome).12,13
(2)	Indications for intermittent use: Life-­threatening infection or history
of recurrent or serious infections in patients with neutropenia.12
(3)	Side effects: Bone pain, headache, rashes.
b.	Stem cell transplant: Indicated for bone marrow failure (e.g., Fanconi
anemia), poor response to G-­CSF, severe congenital neutropenia with
high risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia.12
3.	Complications: See Chapter 22 for management of neutropenic fever
and typhlitis.
4.	Anticipatory guidance:11
a.	Maintain good oral hygiene and skin care to prevent local infections.
b.	Avoid rectal temperatures, rectal examinations, or rectal medications
due to risk of mucosal trauma and bacteremia.
c.	No live or attenuated-­live vaccines for patients with impaired
T-­/B-­lymphocyte function. Otherwise follow usual vaccination
schedule.
d.	If fever >38.4°C, seek emergent care for CBC, blood culture, and
empiric antibiotics.
e.	Children with mild-­moderate neutropenia can attend school/daycare,
if they avoid obviously ill children.

A. Definition of Thrombocytopenia
1.	Defined as platelet count <150,000/μL.
2.	See Table 14.1 for age-­specific values.
B. Bleeding Risk with Thrombocytopenia
1.	Risk of clinically significant bleeding is related to both platelet function
and number. Unlikely with platelet counts >30,000/μL in the absence of
other complicating factors.14
2.	Risk of severe bleeding (CNS hemorrhage, gross hematuria, melena/hematochezia, hematemesis) increases with platelet counts <10,000/μL.14
C. Evaluation of Thrombocytopenia15,16
1.	Platelet size: Large = mean platelet volume (MPV) >11 fL, normal =
MPV 7 to 11 fL, small = MPV <7 fL.
a.	Large platelets suggest increased marrow production in destructive
processes (e.g., immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]) or some congenital disorders.
b.	Small platelets suggest production defects, typically seen in congenital disorders.
2.	Peripheral blood smear: Confirm platelet count, evaluate size and morphology, and rule out artifact platelet aggregation (i.e., due to artificial
clumping in EDTA tube).
3.	Immature platelet fraction: Correlates with measure of reticulated platelets, which reflects thrombopoiesis. Increases with peripheral destruction; is normal/low with bone marrow failure.
4.	Bone marrow aspiration: Obtain if systemic symptoms concerning
for underlying malignancy, involvement other cell lines, and/or blasts
on smear. Differentiates decreased production versus increased
destruction.
D. Causes of Thrombocytopenia and Impaired Platelet Function
1.	See Table 14.9 for an approach to the differential of
thrombocytopenia.
2.	See Table 14.10 for differential of abnormal platelet function.
E. Management of Thrombocytopenia
1.	ITP17
a.	Pathophysiology: Immune-­mediated destruction of circulating
platelets.
b.	Presentation: Otherwise healthy 2-­to 10-­year-­old child with sudden
bruising or bleeding after recent mild illness or vaccination, isolated
thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,000/μL), and peripheral smear
with thrombocytopenia and reticulated large platelets.
c.	Diagnostic testing: No additional testing needed if presentation
consistent with ITP. If persists >3 to 6 months, pursue further
workup: Infection testing (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis
C, Helicobacter pylori infection), antinuclear antibody, anticardiolipin

severe thrombocytopenia to prevent intracranial or intrapulmonary
hemorrhage.
6.	Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia23
a.	Pathophysiology: Maternal IgG antibodies (usually against paternally
inherited PLA-­1/HPA-­1a) cross placenta and cause neonatal platelet
destruction.
b.	Presentation: Severe thrombocytopenia, intracranial hemorrhage
(ICH).
c.	Diagnostic testing: Identify antipaternal antibodies in infant circulation or maternal and infant platelet antigen typing.
d.	Management: Head ultrasound (US) to screen for ICH, transfuse
platelets if <30,000/μL or signs of bleeding, consider IVIG if poor
response to platelet transfusion.

IV. COAGULATION
A. Evaluation of Coagulation and Platelet Function
1.	Coagulation
a.	See Fig. 14.3 for coagulation cascade.
b.	Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): Measures intrinsic system and common pathway—Factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, fibrinogen,
and prothrombin.
c.	Prothrombin time (PT): Measures extrinsic pathway and common
pathway—Factors V, VII, X, fibrinogen, and prothrombin.
d.	Thrombin time (TT): Measures conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.
Prolonged with low or dysfunctional fibrinogen and anticoagulants
(heparin, low molecular weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors),
but not with common pathway abnormalities.
e.	Reptilase time (RT): Normal with heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors, but prolonged with fibrinogen abnormalities.
f.	Mixing study: Used in patients with abnormal clotting (i.e., prolonged
PT, aPTT, or TT) to determine presence of factor deficiency (corrects
with addition of normal plasma) or factor inhibitor (no correction
would occur).
g.	Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT): Russell viper activates factor
X directly and is sensitive to inhibition by antiphospholipid antibodies. Prolonged dRVVT that corrects with addition of phospholipid
to assay suggests presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (Lupus
anticoagulants).24

Intrinsic
pathway

350  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
h.	Fibrinogen: Low levels (<50 to 100 mg/dL) causes impaired clot
formation and prolongs PT and aPTT. Decreased in disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, traumatic hemorrhage.
i.	D-­dimer: Fibrin degradation product increased with recent/ongoing
fibrinolysis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, DIC,
and many other clinical scenarios).
j.	Thromboelastography (TEG): Whole blood test that rapidly measures
time parameters of clot formation and overall clot strength, detects
increased fibrinolysis. Useful for identification of coagulopathy and to
guide transfusion in cardiac surgery and trauma.25
2.	Platelet function12
a.	Always assess platelet number and use of platelet inhibitors (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-­inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) before platelet function testing.
b.	Light transmission aggregometry (LTA): Measures platelet aggregation
in vitro.16
c.	Platelet function analyzer-­100 (PFA-­100): Measures primary hemostasis (platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation) in vitro.16
d.	Bleeding time (BT): Evaluates clot formation, including platelet number/function and vWF, in vivo. Technically challenging to perform and
has been largely replaced by above tests.
B. Definition of Abnormal Coagulation
1.	An incorrect anticoagulant-­to-­blood ratio will give inaccurate results.
2.	See Table 14.11 at end of chapter which lists normal hematologic
values for coagulation testing.
C. Causes and Management of Coagulopathy
1.	Medications
a.	Heparin affects aPTT, thrombin time, dRVVT, and mixing studies.
b.	Warfarin affects PT, may mildly affect aPTT, and interferes with
dRVVT by reducing the activity of vitamin K–dependent factors
(II, VII, IX, X, protein C and S).
2.	Disseminated intravascular coagulation
a.	Tissue damage (e.g., due to sepsis, trauma, malignancy) results in
tissue factor release and systemic activation of coagulation system,
consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, increased fibrin
formation and fibrinolysis, MAHA, bleeding, and microthromboses.26
b.	Diagnosis: Prolonged P T and aPTT, decreased fibrinogen, thrombocytopenia, increased D-­Dimer, increased fibrin degradation products,
and presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
c.	Treatment: Address underlying condition and supportive care. May
require FFP, cryoprecipitate, and/or platelet transfusions if active
bleeding or high bleeding risk.
3.	Liver disease
a.	The liver is the major site of synthesis of factors V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII.
b.	It is also involved in the synthesis of prothrombin, plasminogen,
fibrinogen, proteins C and S, and ATIII.

4.	Vitamin K deficiency
a.	Often secondary to liver disease, pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, exclusive breastfeeding, prolonged antibiotic use, malignancy.
b.	Necessary for synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C, and protein S.12
c.	Treatment: Parenteral vitamin K corrects PT in 2 to 6 hours. Oral
form corrects in 6-­8 hours.27 Give FFP if evidence of severe bleeding. Prothrombin complex concentrate can be given in cases of
life-­threatening hemorrhage or ICH.
5.	Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX
deficiency)28
a.	Etiology: X-­linked recessive disorders. Females can be symptomatic carriers.
b.	Diagnosis: Prolonged aPTT that corrects with mixing study, normal
PT, low factor assays. Mild forms can have normal aPTT.
c.	Classification of disease severity:28
(1)	Severe: <1% activity; spontaneous bleed (hemarthrosis, hematoma) without trauma.
(2)	Moderate: 1% to 5% activity; bleeding after minor trauma.
(3)	Mild: 5% to 40% activity; bleeding with surgery or significant trauma.
d.	Bleeding prophylaxis:
(1)	Home prophylaxis: Intravenous (IV) factor replacement (per
individualized protocols) to maintain factor level >1 IU/dL to
prevent spontaneous bleeds and preserve joint function. Initiate
before onset of frequent bleeding, typically in 1-­to 3-­year-­olds.29
Emicizumab-­kxwh is a bispecific antibody that is delivered subcutaneously (SQ) and can be used for prophylaxis.
(2)	Surgical prophylaxis: Factor replacement for goal factor level
80 to 100 IU/dL (major procedure) or 50 to 80 IU/dL (minor
procedure) preoperatively and through postoperative period of
bleeding risk.28 Consult hematologist before any diagnostic or
therapeutic procedure, including dental, endoscopy with biopsy,
arterial blood gas, etc.
e.	Treatment of acute bleeds:
(1)	Always remember: “Factor first!” Do not delay first dose for
evaluation.
(2)	Bolus dose FVIII or FVIX concentrate. May require additional
doses.
(3)	Consult hematologist for all major bleeding.
(4)	See Table 14.12 for desired factor replacement level and dosing.
(5)	Half-­life of Factor VIII: 8 to 12 hours. Half-­life Factor IX: 18 to 24
hours.28
(6)	If suspected intracranial bleed, replete 100% factor level immediately on presentation and before additional diagnostic testing
(e.g., CT scan).
(7)	Alternative treatments for mild Hemophilia A: Desmopressin (DDAVP)
and antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid).

(8)	Can use cryoprecipitate (for Hemophilia A, not for Hemophilia B)
or FFP if no factor available.
f.	Factor inhibitors: IgG antibodies that develop with repeat factor
exposure and complicate treatment. Patients with severe hemophilia
A are at the highest risk.
(1)	Screen for inhibitors with inhibitor assay if poor clinical response
to factor. Consider screen during initiation of factor treatment
and preoperatively.
(2)	In the presence of inhibitors, patients may require higher doses
of factor, recombinant FVIIa, or activated prothrombin complex
concentrates.
g.	Healthcare maintenance
(1)	Vaccinations: Given per routine schedule. Give prophylactic factor for intramuscular vaccines or give vaccine SQ with smallest
gauge needle without factor prophylaxis.28
(2)	Physical activity: Avoid high contact (e.g., soccer, hockey) and
high velocity (e.g., skiing) activities.28
(3)	Medications to avoid: Aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants.
(4)	Many younger children will need a central venous catheter for
factor delivery and must therefore follow strict fever guidelines.
6.	Von Willebrand (vW) disease
a.	Pathophysiology: Most common inherited bleeding disorder.
Abnormal platelet adhesion and aggregation, low factor VIII.30
b.	Diagnosis: Low circulating vWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and/or low vWF function
on ristocetin-­based platelet aggregation study (VWF:RCo), low or normal
factor VIII activity, prolonged PFA-­100. May require additional evaluation.
c.	Classification:30
(1)	Type 1 (75% to 80% cases): Partial quantitative deficiency.
(2)	Type 2 (20% to 25%): Qualitative dysfunction.

(3)	Type 3 (rare): Absence or near absence of vWF + markedly low
factor VIII activity (can resemble Hemophilia A patient on labs
and presentation).
d.	Treatment:30
(1)	Desmopressin (DDAVP): Stimulates vWF release. Given IV or
intranasal. May be used as prophylaxis for minor surgeries or
treatment for mild bleeding. Ineffective in Type 3, variable effect
in Type 2. Patients should be tested for DDAVP response before
using as prophylaxis.
(2)	VWF-­containing concentrates (Humate-­P, Alphanate, or Wilate):
Replaces vWF and factor VIII and derived from blood donors.
Recombinant vWF available (VONVENDI). Used for severe
bleeding events and surgery.
(3)	Cryoprecipitate only appropriate for life-­threatening situations if
vWF concentrate unavailable.
(4)	Alternative therapies: IV or oral antifibrinolytic therapy (tranexamic
acid and aminocaproic acid) can be used to prevent or treat mild
mucocutaneous bleeding alone or in conjunction with other therapies.
D. Causes of Hypercoagulability
1.	Most thrombotic events are due to an acquired condition; however,
an inherited thrombophilia is more likely if there is a family history, an
unusual thrombus location, absence of an inciting factor, and/or recurrent thromboses.
2.	See Table 14.13 for etiologies and evaluation of hypercoagulable states.
3.	Acquired conditions associated with venous thromboembolism
include endothelial damage (vascular catheters, sepsis, smoking,
diabetes, hypertension, surgery, hyperlipidemia), disturbed blood
flow (central venous lines, congenital heart disease), hyperviscosity (macroglobulinemia, polycythemia, sickle cell disease), platelet
activation (essential thrombocytosis, oral contraceptives, heparin-­
induced thrombocytopenia), malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease,
parenteral nutrition, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria.
E. Thrombus Management
1.	See Table 14.14 for anticoagulant use.
2.	See Formulary for dosing and adjustment based on monitoring protocols.
3.	Note: Children receiving anticoagulation therapy should be protected
from trauma. Subcutaneous injections should be used when possible,
and caution should be used with intramuscular injections. The use of
antiplatelet agents and arterial punctures should be avoided.
4.	See Table 14.15 for warfarin reversal guidelines.

367.e2  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information

VII. ONLINE CONTENT
A. Specific PRBC Types
1.	Leukoreduced RBCs: 99.9% white blood cells (WBCs) removed to
reduce risks of pathogen transmission (e.g., CMV), HLA alloimmunization and febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction.
2.	Washed RBCs: Removal of plasma proteins in products for recipients
with history of anaphylactic transfusions reactions or complete IgA
deficiency.
3.	CMV-­safe RBCs: Leukoreduced units likely comparable to low transmission risk with CMV-­seronegative units (from donors with negative CMV
serology). Preferred for vulnerable populations: CMV-­negative bone
marrow transplant or solid organ recipients, immunodeficient patients,
premature or low birth weight infants, intrauterine transfusions, pregnant women.
4.	Irradiated blood products: Inactivated donor lymphocytes capable of
causing transfusion-­associated graft versus host disease (GVHD).33
Used for susceptible patients: leukemia, lymphoma, BMT, solid organ
transplant, intensive chemotherapy, known/suspected immune deficiency, intrauterine transfusions, neonate transfusions, patients receiving T-­cell suppressive therapy. Also necessary in directed donation from
a relative.
B. Directed Donor Transfusions
1.	When to consider directed donor:
a.	Chronic transfusion programs (e.g., “blood buddy” programs), where
donors provide antigen-­matched red cells repetitively for the same
patient requiring frequent transfusions (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell
disease).
b.	NAIT, where maternal platelets lack causative antigens and represent
optimal therapy.
2.	Reasons to not consider directed donor:
a.	Practice not often feasible. Specific screening, donation, product
testing, and processing causes delays (2 to 3 days or more) when
compatible blood is often readily available.
b.	Directed donor may not be compatible: must be at least ABO/RhD
compatible, and may require other RBC antigen compatibility if
recipient has antibodies.
c.	Directed donors less likely to be truthful in donor screening, causing
potential increased infection risk.
d.	Products from a relative require irradiation for increased risk of
transfusion-­related graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD).
e.	If RBC donor is also a potential bone marrow transplant donor for
recipient, donation increases risk of development of donor-­directed
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in recipient, which may
cause graft failure.

Immunology and Allergy
Carlos A. Salgado, MD
I. ALLERGIC RHINITIS1–6
A. Epidemiology
1.	Most common pediatric chronic medical condition: Prevalence in children up to 40%.
2.	Increases risk for recurrent otitis media, asthma, and acute and chronic
sinusitis.
3.	Risk factors: Atopic family history, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E >100
IU/mL before age 6 years, higher socioeconomic status, and infant
exposure to maternal smoking in utero and during early childhood.
B. Diagnosis
1.	History:
a.	Allergen-­driven mucosal inflammation leading to cyclical exacerbations or persistent symptoms.
b.	Symptoms: Nasal (congestion, rhinorrhea, and pruritus), ocular
(pruritus and tearing), and postnasal drip (sore throat and cough).
c.	Patterns: Seasonal (depending on local allergens) versus perennial
(with seasonal peaks)
d.	Coexisting atopic diseases common (eczema, asthma, and food
allergy).
2.	Physical examination:
a.	Allergic facies with shiners, mouth breathing, transverse nasal
crease (“allergic salute”), and accentuated lines below lower eyelids
(Dennie-­Morgan lines).
b.	May have swollen nasal turbinates.
c.	Injected sclera with or without clear discharge, conjunctival
cobblestoning.
3.	Diagnostic studies:
a.	Diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds, however allergy with
skin tests or allergen-­specific IgE testing can identify specific allergic
sensitivities.
b.	Total IgE, peripheral blood eosinophil count and imaging studies are
not recommended due to poor specificity.
C. Differential Diagnosis
Vasomotor/nonallergic rhinitis (hypersensitivity to scents, alcohol, or
changes in climate), infectious rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound rhinitis from prolonged use of nasal vasoconstrictors),
sinusitis, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome, and nasal polyps.
368

Immunology and Allergy   369

D. Treatment
1.	Allergen avoidance:
a.	Relies on identification of triggers, most common of which are pollens, fungi, dust mites, insects, and animals.
b.	HEPA filter may be useful when animal allergens are a concern.
c.	Thorough housecleaning and allergy-­proof bed coverings can be useful.
2.	Oral antihistamines:
a.	First-­line treatment for mild or episodic symptoms or young patients
who cannot tolerate or refuse nasal sprays.
b.	Second-­and third-­generation preparations preferable (loratadine,
desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine, and levocetirizine) due to
reduced central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
c.	Adverse effects: Sedation and anticholinergic side effects (more
prominent with first-­generation agents).
3.	Intranasal corticosteroids (fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide, flunisolide, ciclesonide, and triamcinolone):
a.	First-­line for persistent or moderate-­to-­severe symptoms, as it is the
most effective single maintenance therapy for nasal congestion and
reduction of ocular symptoms.
b.	Maximal therapeutic benefit when used over several days or weeks.
No effect with as-needed use.
c.	Adverse effects: Nasal irritation, sneezing, bleeding, and potential
risk of reduction in growth velocity and adrenal suppression at high
doses, especially in patients on multiple steroid preparations. Growth
monitoring recommended.
d.	Administration: Clear mucus crusting, keep head pointed slightly
down and avoid pointing medication at nasal septum.
4.	Leukotriene inhibitors (montelukast):
a.	More effective in combination with antihistamines.
b.	Consider in patients with concomitant asthma.
5.	Intranasal antihistamines (azelastine and olopatadine):
a.	Effective for acute symptoms; faster onset of action than glucocorticoid nasal spray.
b.	Adverse effects: Bitter taste, systemic absorption with potential for
sedation.
6.	Intranasal combination agents (azelastine/fluticasone): Useful for
patients with moderate-­to-­severe allergic rhinitis.
7.	Immunotherapy:
a.	Success rate is high when patients are chosen carefully and when
performed by an allergy specialist.
b.	Consider when symptoms are inadequately controlled with medications and allergen avoidance.
c.	In addition to traditional subcutaneous immunotherapy, sublingual
products have now been approved for several allergens.
d.	Not recommended for patients with poor adherence to therapy or
those with poorly controlled asthma.

15

Chapter 15

370  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
e.	Not well studied in children younger than 5 years.
f.	May reduce risk for future development of asthma, and treatment of
allergic rhinitis may improve asthma control.
8.	Nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline: Use distilled, sterile, or boiled
water (at least 3 minutes) for homemade solutions.
9.	Ophthalmic agents: Can be used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Up
to 60% of patients with allergic rhinitis have concomitant conjunctivitis. Avoid the use of steroids unless under the direction of an
ophthalmologist.
a.	Mast cell stabilizers: Cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide-­tromethamine,
nedocromil, and pemirolast.
b.	H1-­antagonists and mast cell stabilizers: Alcaftadine, azelastine
HCl, bepotastine, emedastine, epinastine, ketotifen fumarate, and
olopatadine.

II. FOOD ALLERGY7–12
A. Epidemiology
1.	Prevalence is 6% to 8% in young children and 3% to 4% in
adolescence.
2.	Most common allergens in children: Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts (e.g.,
cashew, walnut), soy, fish, shellfish, and wheat.
B. Manifestations of Food Allergy
1.	Often a combination of several syndromes; symptoms can occur within
minutes to hours of ingesting food.
2.	Diagnosis requires both sensitization (demonstration of allergen-­specific
IgE) and clinical symptoms after exposure to allergens.
3.	Anaphylaxis: See Chapter 1.
4.	Skin syndromes:
a.	Urticaria/angioedema:
(1)	Chronic urticaria is rarely related to food allergy.
(2)	Acute urticaria due to food allergy may be a risk factor for future
anaphylaxis.
b.	Atopic dermatitis/eczema:
(1)	Food allergy is more common in patients with atopic dermatitis.
(2)	Even if not apparent by history, at least one-­third of children with
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have IgE-­mediated food
allergies.
5.	Gastrointestinal syndromes:
a.	Oral allergy syndrome:
(1)	Pollen-­associated food allergy caused by cross-­reactivity of antibodies to pollens (e.g., apple and tree pollen).
(2)	Pruritus of oral mucosa after ingestion of certain fresh fruits
and vegetables in patients with pollen allergies. Rarely results in
edema of oral mucosa, or progresses beyond mouth/throat.
(3)	Inciting antigens are usually denatured by cooking.

Immunology and Allergy   371

b.	Allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, esophagitis: see Chapter 12
c.	Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES):
(1)	Presents in infancy.
(2)	Vomiting and diarrhea (may contain blood); when severe, may
lead to lethargy, dehydration, hypotension, acidosis.
(3)	Most commonly associated with milk and soy, but may
occur with a wide variety of foods (e.g., rice, oat, fruits, and
vegetables).
d.	Infantile proctocolitis:
(1)	Confined to distal colon and can present with diarrhea or blood-­
streaked and mucous-­containing stools.
(2)	Symptoms usually resolve within 72 hours of stopping offending
agent; rarely leads to anemia.
C. Diagnosis of Food Allergy (Fig. 15.1)
1.	History and physical examination:
a.	Identify specific foods and whether fresh vs. cooked.
b.	Establish timing and nature of reactions.
2.	Skin testing:
a.	Skin prick test has poor positive predictive value, but very good negative predictive value.
b.	Patient must not be taking antihistamines.
c.	Widespread skin conditions (e.g., dermatographism, urticaria, severe
eczema) may limit ability to perform skin tests.
3.	Measurement of allergen-­specific IgE:
a.	Similar to skin tests, it has poor positive predictive value and excellent negative predictive value.
b.	Levels above a certain range (variable amongst different antigens)
have increasing positive predictive value.
c.	Useful in patients with dermatologic conditions that preclude skin
testing.
d.	Component testing (measuring IgE to specific food proteins rather
than crude extracts) may improve diagnostic accuracy for peanut
and possibly other foods.
4.	Oral food challenges:
a.	Can verify clinical reactivity to a specific food allergen or document
that a food allergy has been outgrown.
b.	Must be performed under close medical supervision with emergency
medications readily available.
c.	Patient must not be taking antihistamines.
d.	Most accurate when double-­blinded using graded doses of disguised
food.
5.	Trial elimination diet:
a.	Helpful if improvement with removal of food from diet.
b.	Essential, especially in infants and for non-­IgE-­mediated food
allergy.

b.	Patients must pay close attention to food ingredients. Implement an
“If you can’t read it, you can’t eat it” approach to avoid risky unlabeled foods.
c.	Nutritional counseling and regular growth monitoring are
recommended.
2.	Nonanaphylactic angioedema/urticaria:
a.	Antihistamines or corticosteroids, based on severity and duration of
symptoms.
b.	Omalizumab used for chronic urticaria.
3.	Atopic dermatitis: Symptomatic control (see Chapter 8).
4.	Anaphylaxis:
a.	See Chapter 1 for management of anaphylaxis.
b.	Prescribe epinephrine auto-­injector for all at-­risk patients. Counsel to
call 9-­1-­1 if using.
c.	Develop Anaphylaxis Action Plan indicating specific allergies, symptoms for which to observe, and medications to be administered.
d.	Counsel families to always have epinephrine auto-injector readily
available.
e.	Make school aware of Anaphylaxis Action Plan and ensure they can
administer lifesaving medications.
5.	Food-­specific immunotherapy is under investigation. It is used to induce
clinical desensitization to specific allergens.
F. Natural History
1.	About 50% of milk, egg, soy, and wheat allergies are outgrown by school age.
2.	Peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are outgrown only in 10% to 20%.
3.	Skin tests and allergen-­specific IgE may remain positive, even though
symptoms resolve.

III. DRUG ALLERGY13,14
A. Definition
1.	Drug allergy: Immunologically mediated response to an agent in a sensitized person.
2.	Drug intolerance: Undesirable pharmacologic effect.
3.	Although 10% of patients report penicillin allergy, after evaluation, about
90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillin.
B. Diagnosis
1.	Cutaneous manifestations are the most common presentation for drug
allergic reactions.
2.	Diagnostic studies: Penicillin is the only drug for which standardized
skin testing reagents and procedures have been validated. Skin testing
or supervised graded dose challenge may be done with caution for other

15

Chapter 15

374  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
medications, but the results must be carefully considered in the context
of the clinical pictures, as both false positive and false negative results
are common.
C. Management (Fig. 15.2)
1.	Avoidance: When able, utilize alternative therapy.
2.	Desensitization: Progressive administration of an allergenic substance to
render immune system less reactive.

1.	Indications:
a.	Replacement therapy for antibody-­deficient disorders:
(1)	Children with severe hypogammaglobulinemia (<100 mg/dL) may
benefit from a higher total loading dose in two separate doses a
few days apart, followed by standard dosing every 3 to 4 weeks.
(2)	Useful in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), antibody
deficiency (IgG concentration <400 mg/dL from failure to form
antibodies to common antigens), recurrent serious bacterial
infections, or prior to measles prophylaxis.

b.	Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (see Chapter 14):
(1)	Initially given on a single day or in divided doses over 2 to 5
consecutive days.
(2)	Maintenance dose given every 3 to 6 weeks based on clinical
response and platelet count.
c.	Bone marrow transplantation:
(1)	Adjust dosing to maintain trough IgG level of at least 400 mg/dL.
(2)	May decrease incidence of infection and death but not acute
graft-­versus-­host disease.
d.	Other indications:
(1)	Kawasaki disease (see Chapter 7).
(2)	Guillain-­Barré syndrome.
(3)	Refractory dermatomyositis and polymyositis.
(4)	Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
2.	Precautions and adverse reactions:
a.	Severe systemic symptoms (hemodynamic changes, respiratory difficulty, and anaphylaxis).
b.	Less-­severe systemic reactions (headache, myalgia, fever, chills,
nausea, and vomiting).
(1)	Decrease infusion rate and/or premedicate with intravenous
corticosteroids, and/or antipyretics.
(2)	Can progress to aseptic meningitis syndrome.
c.	Acute renal failure (increased risk with preexisting renal insufficiency
and with sucrose-­containing IVIG).
d.	Acute venous thrombosis (increased risk with sucrose-­containing
IVIG).
e.	Use with caution in patients with confirmed undetectable IgA levels
(e.g., patients with partial B-­cell immunodeficiencies or familial
IgA deficiency), as antibodies against IgA may trigger anaphylactic
reaction.
B. Intramuscular Immunoglobulin (IMIG)
1.	Prophylaxis Indications: Hepatitis A, measles, rubella, rabies, and
varicella-­zoster (see Chapter 16).
2.	Precautions and adverse reactions:
a.	Similar to IVIG (discussed previously).
b.	Local reaction at injection site increases with repeated use.
c.	Intravenous or intradermal use of IMIG is absolutely contraindicated
due to high risk for anaphylactoid reactions.
3.	Administration:
a.	No more than 5 mL should be given at one site in large child/adolescent, and 1 to 3 mL for smaller children/infants.
b.	Administration of greater than 15 mL at one time is essentially never
warranted.
c.	Peak serum levels achieved by 48 hours; immune effect lasts 3 to 4
weeks.

15

Chapter 15

378  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
C. Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin
1.	Indication: Replacement therapy for antibody deficiency.
2.	Dose:
a.	See the Formulary for dosages and administration instructions.
b.	Larger doses can be given simultaneously in multiple sites or more
frequently than once weekly.
c.	Using the same areas for injections improves tolerability.
3.	Precautions and adverse reactions:
a.	Systemic side effects are rare because of the small volumes given
and the slow absorption rate.
b.	Local redness and swelling are expected and generally decrease with
every infusion.
4.	Considerations: Does not require venous access or special nursing (parents can administer), but may require multiple needlesticks in larger
children, depending on the volume to be infused.
D. Specific Immunoglobulins
1.	Hyperimmune globulins:
a.	Prepared from donors with high titers of specific antibodies.
b.	Includes hepatitis B immune globulin, varicella-­zoster immune
globulin, cytomegalovirus immune globulin, Rho(D) immune globulin, botulism immune globulin, and others.
2.	Monoclonal antibody preparations (rituximab, palivizumab, and others).

3.	Combination vaccines can reduce number of injections.
a.	MMR-­Varicella (ProQuad)4 can be used for children 12 months
through 12 years of age. There is an increased risk of febrile seizures
if given as first dose for ages 12 to 47 months.
b.	HepB-­containing5 combination vaccines should not be administered
to infants <6 weeks because of the other components.
4.	Simultaneous administration
a.	Routine childhood vaccines are safe and effective when administered simultaneously at different sites. There is no maximum number
of vaccines that can be coadministered.
b.	If live vaccines are not given at the same visit, they should be separated by an interval of 28 days.
C. Live, Attenuated Vaccines
1.	Certain vaccines have live components that must replicate to produce
immunity: Influenza (intranasal), MMR, oral polio vaccine (OPV), BCG,
typhoid (oral), varicella, yellow fever.
2.	Systemic adverse reactions following these vaccines are usually mild,
and usually occur 3 to 21 days after the vaccine is given.
3.	Special consideration must be taken when administering these vaccines
to patients with certain underlying medical conditions (see Section IV).
D. Timing and Spacing of Vaccine Doses
1.	For information on recommended timing and spacing of vaccines, see:
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-­recs/general-­recs/timing.html.
2.	Combination vaccines
a.	Minimum age for administration is the oldest age for any of the individual components.
b.	Minimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of
any of the individual components.
E. Contraindications and Precautions6
1.	Contraindication: A condition that increases the likelihood of a serious
adverse reaction to a vaccine for a patient with that condition.
2.	Precaution: A condition that may increase the likelihood or severity of an
adverse reaction in a vaccine recipient, or may compromise the ability
of the vaccine to produce immunity.
3.	Table 16.3: Contraindications and precautions to select vaccines.
4.	Table 16.4: Conditions incorrectly perceived as contraindications or precautions to vaccination (vaccines may be given under these conditions).

(2)	Obtaining titers and revaccinating those with unprotective levels.
c.	Timing of resumption of immunization varies based on the patient’s
specific treatment regimen (from 3 months to ≥24 months).
(1)	Inactivated vaccines are generally delayed until ≥6 months after
the end of chemotherapy.
(2)	Live vaccines are generally delayed until ≥12 months after the
end of chemotherapy.
d.	Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) should be given annually, even
during chemotherapy.
7.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients
a.	After transplant, HSCT recipients are considered to have lost immunity to all vaccines. Reimmunize against all vaccine-­preventable
illnesses.
(1)	Inactivated vaccines are safe to administer 6 to 12 months after
HSCT. Our center starts the pneumococcal series at 6 months
and the remainder at 12 months.
(2)	IIV may be given as early at 6 months post-­HSCT. Children
≤8 years should receive two doses. Do not administer
LAIV. During a community outbreak, IIV may be given 3
to 4 months post-­HSCT, with a second dose 4 weeks later
­regardless of age.
(3)	Avoid live vaccines during the first 24 months post transplant.
(4)	For specific vaccine recommendations, see Table EC 16.B.
b.	Consider passive immunoprophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis after
exposures (see Table 16.5).
c.	Household contacts should receive routine immunizations. Only
exception is LAIV if the HSCT recipient’s level of immunocompromise
is severe (e.g., HSCT in last 3 months). HSCT recipients should avoid
contact with body fluids or skin eruptions of household contact who
received rotavirus or varicella vaccines, respectively.
8.	Solid organ transplant recipients
a.	See Section IV.B.3 for pneumococcal vaccination recommendations.
b.	Before transplant: Give all routinely recommended vaccines. Give live
vaccines ≥4 weeks prior to transplantation.
(1)	Children 6 to 11 months can receive MMR if not immunosuppressed and if transplant is ≥4 weeks away.
(2)	Children 6 to 11 months (or without evidence of varicella immunity) can receive varicella vaccine if not immunosuppressed and
if transplant is ≥4 weeks away.
c.	After transplant: Inactivated vaccines, including those indicated for
immunocompromised hosts, should resume 2 to 6 months after
transplant. Live vaccines are generally not given after transplant. For
specific vaccine recommendations, see Table EC 16.C.
9.	Patients on corticosteroids

V. COUNSELING AND COMMUNICATION ABOUT VACCINES16-­26
A. Vaccine Hesitancy
1.	Definition: Delay in the acceptance or refusal to vaccinate despite the
availability of vaccine services. Not a dichotomous behavior, but a continuum. Vaccine-­hesitant parents may accept all vaccines but remain
concerned, accept some vaccines and refuse others, or refuse all vaccines.
Approximately 3% of parents in the United States refuse all vaccines.20
2.	The AAP recommends continued engagement with vaccine-­hesitant
parents while providing other health services and attempting to modify
opposition to vaccines.
3.	Determinants of vaccine acceptance
a.	The 3C Model: Confidence, Complacency, Convenience. Key determinants of vaccine acceptance in global populations as determined
by the World Health Organization (WHO) SAGE Working Group on
Vaccine Hesitancy. See Online Content for more details.
b.	Parental concerns about vaccines (Box 16.1)
BOX 16.1
PARENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT VACCINES
Vaccine Safety
Too many vaccines
Development of autism
Vaccine additives (thimerosal, aluminum)
Overload of the immune system
Serious adverse reactions
Potential for long-­term adverse events
Inadequate research performed before licensure
May cause pain to the child
May make the child sick
Disease is more “natural” than vaccine
Parents do not believe diseases being prevented are serious
Vaccine-­preventable diseases have disappeared
Not all vaccines are needed
Vaccines do not work
Freedom of Choice
Parents have the right to choose whether to immunize their child
Parents know what’s best for their child
Believe that the risks outweigh the benefits of vaccine
Do not trust organized medicine, public health
Do not trust government health authorities
Do not trust pharmaceutical companies
Ethical, moral, or religious reasons

B. Countering Vaccine Hesitancy
1.	Parent and/or patient-­specific concerns should be acknowledged and
addressed while correcting misconceptions in a nonconfrontational manner.
2.	Relationship with primary care provider/pediatrician is a strong influence on decision to vaccinate. Mutual desire to do what is best for the
child should be emphasized.

1.	Confidence: Trust in healthcare professionals, vaccines, and their effectiveness. Includes concerns regarding vaccine safety, quality of interactions with healthcare providers, religious beliefs, and media influence.
2.	Complacency: Low awareness of the risks of vaccine-­preventable diseases and the importance of vaccines. Includes resistance to introduction of new vaccines, resistance to mode of vaccine delivery, and lack of
knowledge about the risks of now uncommon diseases.
3.	Convenience: Availability of and accessibility to vaccines and healthcare
services (rural areas, low-­middle income countries). Includes vaccine
supply issues, lack of education or medical literacy, geographic barriers,
political conflicts and instability, and immigration.
C. Strategies to Address Vaccine Hesitancy18-­19,22-­26
1.	Communication
a.	Studies have found that parents want more information than they
are getting, want balanced information about potential benefits and
harms, struggle to find unbiased, trustworthy sources of information, and view healthcare workers as an important source of
information.
b.	Consider the timing for making vaccination information available to
parents, the settings where information is available, the provision
of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and
parents’ perceptions of health workers and the information provided.
c.	AAP Communication Highlights (Box EC 16.A)
2.	Interventions
a.	SAGE Working Group assessed systematic reviews and meta-­
analyses of worldwide strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. No
convincing evidence that any specific intervention to address parental vaccine hesitancy/refusal is effective across populations.
b.	Most effective interventions were tailored to specific populations and
addressing specific concerns, pointing to the importance of understanding the drivers of vaccine hesitancy to inform the interventions.
c.	Most successful interventions were multicomponent strategies
that directly targeted unvaccinated/under vaccinated populations,
aimed to increase vaccine knowledge and awareness, improved
convenience and access to vaccination, mandated vaccination, and
engaged religious or other influential leaders to promote vaccination.

407.e2  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
BOX EC 16.A
VACCINE COMMUNICATION HIGHLIGHTS
Vaccines are safe and effective, and serious disease can occur if your child and
family are not immunized.
Vaccine-­hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group, and their individual
concerns should be respected and addressed.
Vaccines are tested thoroughly before licensure, and vaccine safety assessment
networks exist to monitor vaccine safety after licensure.
Nonmedical vaccine exemptions increase rates of unvaccinated children.
Unvaccinated children put vaccinated children and medically exempt children
who live in that same area at risk.
Pediatricians and other healthcare providers play a major role in educating parents about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
Strong provider commitment to vaccination can influence hesitant or resistant parents. Personalizing vaccine acceptance is often an effective approach.
The majority of parents accepted the provider’s vaccine recommendations when
they were presented as required immunizations to maintain optimal disease
prevention.
The current vaccine schedule is the only one recommended by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP). Alternative schedules have not been evaluated.

I. COMMON NEONATAL AND PEDIATRIC INFECTIONS: GUIDELINES
FOR DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL MANAGEMENT
Tables 17.1–17.6 and Figs. 17.1–17.3 present the most common neonatal
and pediatric infections, organized by site of infection or by organism, when
applicable. These recommendations are based on national guidelines and
recent literature. They are not meant to replace clinical judgment.
For recommendations on preliminary identification of bacteria and
antibiotic selection based on spectrum of activity for commonly used antibiotics, please see Sections II–III. Please note that local resistance pattern
should guide antibiotic selection. Follow published institutional guidelines
and culture results for individual patients and infections. When possible,
always use the agent with the narrowest spectrum of activity, particularly
when organism susceptibilities are known.

1.	Diagnosis
a.	See Box 17.1 for screening guidelines and Box 17.2 for information on interpretation of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and interferon
gamma release assays (IGRAs).
b.	If positive screening test, obtain chest X-­ray.
c.	If symptoms indicate active tuberculosis (TB) disease, determine source.
(1)	Consider pediatric protocol chest CT over X-ray when available.
(2)	Specimen sources include sputum, bronchial washings, gastric
aspirates (morning aspirate before feeding/ambulation x 3 specimens), pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, tissue biopsy.
(3)	Acid-­fast smear and/or nucleic acid amplification testing may
provide rapid diagnosis. The latter may also detect rifampin resistance. Solid media culture can take as long as 10 weeks, liquid
media 1 to 6 weeks.
d.	Lumbar puncture is recommended in children less than 12 months
with confirmed TB and should be considered in children 12 to 24
months. (Cont’d on pg. 433.)

for the most up-­to-­date recommendations.
1.	Diagnosis
a.	Perinatal: See Table 17.8 for diagnosis in perinatal period.37
b.	Infants and children38: HIV nucleic acid testing must be used under
18 months to avoid confounding from maternal antibodies. Antigen/
antibody testing can be performed after 18 months. If concern
for breastmilk exposure, test immediately, then at 4 to 6 weeks, 3
months, and 6 months after stopping breastfeeding.
c.	Adolescents39: HIV screening with fourth-­generation antigen/antibody
assay with opt-­out consent as part of routine clinical care. If positive,
confirm with HIV-­1/HIV-­2 immunoassay; if indeterminate, HIV-­1
nucleic acid testing.
2.	Management37–40
a.	See Table 17.7 for management during perinatal period.
b.	Initiation of therapy for all children with HIV is recommended by
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Panel on
Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents and the World
Health Organization (WHO).
c.	Therapy: Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) of at least three
drugs from at least two different classes. Go to http://www.aidsinfo.
nih.gov/ for most current therapy recommendations.
3.	Monitoring38
a.	At diagnosis: CD4 count, plasma HIV RNA viral load, genotype resistance. If starting therapy, HLA-­B*5701 (screening for hypersensitivity
to abacavir) and hepatitis B serology.
b.	Follow-­up not on ART: Every 3 to 4 months, CD4 count, plasma HIV
RNA viral load, CBC with differential, complete metabolic panel with
glucose, renal function, albumin, transaminases, lipid panel. Every 6
to 12 months, obtain urinalysis to evaluate for nephropathy.
c.	Follow-­up on ART: At 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or switching
therapy, CD4, viral load, and labs according to possible toxicities of
ART. Then similar testing as above every 3 to 4 months.
d.	Once viral suppression achieved, CD4 improved, good adherence, and
otherwise stable for 2 to 3 years, can space labs to every 6 to 12 months.
e.	Latent TB skin testing starting at age 3 to 12 months, and then annually.

Consider lumbar puncture and CSF culture before initiation of empiric
antibiotics for infants who are at the highest risk of infection, especially
those with critical illness. Lumbar puncture should not be performed if the
infant’s clinical condition would be compromised, and antibiotics should
be administered promptly and not deferred because of procedure delays.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treatment for at-­risk individuals. Clinicians should complete at-­risk assessment questionnaire at first well-­child
visit, then every 6 months in 1st year of life, and then routine care (at least annually). Screening questions include:
• Born outside the United States in countries with endemic infection
• Traveled outside United States in countries with endemic infection
• Family member with positive tuberculin skin test (TST)
• Exposed to someone who had tuberculosis disease
• Special populations including children with HIV, organ transplant, and those on
immunosuppressive therapies including tumor necrosis factor blockers/antagonists

f.	Vaccines1 (see Chapter 16 and Red Book for details):
(1)	Meningococcal conjugate ACWY (can start at 2 months; 2 or 4
doses depending on age).
(2)	23-­valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine at 2 years.
(3)	MMR can be given if CD4 >15% (any age) and CD4 count > 200
lymphocytes/mm3 (if >5 years).
(4)	Some experts would consider monovalent varicella vaccine for children
>12 months with CD4 >15%. Combined MMRV should not be given.

A tuberculin skin testing (TST) should be read in 48 to 72 hours. The measles vaccine can
suppress TST reactivity for 4 to 6 weeks. An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) can be
used instead of TST in children older than 2 years. It has a higher specificity than TST because
antigens used are not found in Bacillus Calmette-­Guérin (BCG) vaccine or most pathogenic
nontuberculous mycobacteria.

4.	Pre-­exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)7
a.	Common indications
(1)	Men who have sex with men: HIV-positive partner, bacterial STI
(gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis) in past 6 months, history of
inconsistent or condomless anal intercourse with an unknown
status or nonmonogamous partner, commercial (or exchange)
sex, history of high number of sex partners
(2)	Heterosexual men and women: HIV-positive partner, bacterial
STI (gonorrhea, syphilis) in past 6 months, history of inconsistent condom use, commercial (or exchange) sex, history of
high number of sex partners, living in a high HIV prevalence
setting.
b.	Initiating
(1)	Labs: fourth generation HIV test, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia,
HBV, HCV (if ever used IV drugs), and renal function. Pregnancy
test if indicated. Counsel on condom use.
(2)	Use emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy) for biological males. Effective only after 7 days. Emtricitabine/tenofovir
disoproxil (Truvada) for biological females. Effective only after
21 days. Consult infectious disease expert for initiation of PrEP
unless provider has extensive experience.

b.	Indications for nonoccupational (nPEP): Unprotected vaginal/anal
intercourse, oral sex with ejaculation or blood exposure, needle sharing, or injuries with blood exposure from an individual with known
HIV or unknown status.
c.	Labs: 4th-generation HIV test, HBV surface antigen and antibody,
HCV antibody. Depending on exposure, consider tetanus prophylaxis
and STI testing.
d.	Regimen: Initiate as soon as possible (lower likelihood of efficacy at
greater than 72 hours); three-­drug (or more) ART regimen for 28
days. Regimen: tenofovir and emtricitabine with raltegravir. For nPEP,
dolutegravir may be used instead of raltegravir. Consult infectious
disease expert for any initiation of PEP.

II. MICROBIOLOGY
A. Collection of Specimens for Blood Culture
1.	Preparation: To minimize contamination, clean venipuncture site with
70% isopropyl ethyl alcohol. Apply tincture of iodine or 10% povidone-­
iodine and allow skin to dry for at least 1 minute, or scrub site with 2%
chlorhexidine for 30 seconds and allow skin to dry for 30 seconds.
Clean blood culture bottle injection site with alcohol only.
2.	Collection: Two sets of cultures from two different sites of equal blood
volume should be obtained for each febrile episode, based on patient
weight: less than 8 kg, 1 to 3 mL; 8 to 13 kg, 4 to 5 mL; 14 to 25 kg,
5 to 6 mL; greater than 25 kg, 10 mL. Peripheral sites preferred. If
concern for central line infection, collect one from central access site,
second from peripheral. Consider anaerobe blood cultures if concern
for the following: head and neck infections, intra-­abdominal infections,
immunodeficiency, trauma or pressure sore.44,45

A. General Practice46
1.	Regardless of status of patient, if you experience a needlestick or splash
exposure, immediately wash with soap/water, irrigate, report to supervisor, and seek medical assistance.
2.	There is an increased risk of transmission with larger volume of blood,
prolonged exposure, high viral titer, deep injury, or if patient has
advanced disease.
3.	Source should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C antibody, and hepatitis B
surface antigen. Exposed person should be tested for HIV, hepatitis C
antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen.
B. Disease-­Specific Post-Exposure Management
1.	Hepatitis B47: High risk of transmission if surface antigen and e-antigen
positive. Lower risk of transmission if surface antigen positive, e-antigen
negative. Post-exposure management includes hepatitis B immune
globulin and initiation of hepatitis B vaccine series, depending on
immune status. For details, see Chapter 16.
2.	Hepatitis C47: Lower risk of transmission. No preventative therapy is currently
recommended, but this is an evolving field. Follow-­up testing essential.
3.	See Section I.F for information on post-exposure management for HIV.

I. NEWBORN RESUSCITATION
A. Algorithm for Neonatal Resuscitation (Fig. 18.1)
1.	Essential functional equipment: Radiant warmer, prewarmed blankets,
hat, bag-­mask/NeoPIP ventilator, appropriately sized laryngoscope,
appropriately sized endotracheal tube (ETT) +/−stylet, suction device
and bulb syringe, emergency medications, and vascular access supplies.
2.	Meconium stained fluids: Per Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP)
7th edition, routine intrapartum oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suctioning and endotracheal intubation are not recommended.2
3.	Cord clamping should be delayed for at least 30 to 60 seconds for
vigorous term and preterm infants, given no maternal or fetal indications for immediate clamping.3 See Box EC 18.A for exclusions.
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute use of umbilical
cord milking.
B. Endotracheal Tube Size and Depth of Insertion (Table 18.1)
1.	Quick estimations:
a.	ETT size: 2.5 mm for infants <30 weeks gestational age (wGA); 3.0
mm for 30 to 34 wGA; 3.5 mm for >35 wGA.
b.	ETT depth: Infant’s weight (kg) + 6 cm
C. Vascular Access (See Chapter 4 for Umbilical Venous/Artery
Catheter Placement)
NOTE: During the initial resuscitation, an umbilical venous catheter (UVC)
should be inserted just far enough to obtain blood return; no measurement
or verified placement is needed.

II. ROUTINE NEWBORN CARE OF A TERM INFANT
A. General Care for the Full-­Term Healthy Newborn with
Uncomplicated Delivery
NOTE: Protocols vary by hospital.
1.	Drying, removal of wet blankets. Then, preferably skin-­to-­skin contact
with mother4 or otherwise placed under warmer.
2.	Feeding: Preferably breastfeeding soon after birth and on demand
thereafter. Breastfed newborns should feed 8 to 12 times daily.
Formula-­fed newborns should be offered a bottle soon after birth.

3.	Vitamin K injection for prevention of hemorrhagic disease of the
newborn.
4.	Antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for prophylaxis against gonococcal
infection.
5.	Monitor clinically for jaundice, accounting for newborn’s risk factors for
hyperbilirubinemia. Transcutaneous bilirubin monitoring may be useful
as a screening tool but does not replace plasma level.5 Obtain plasma
bilirubin level if warranted. See Section IX for more information and
management.
6.	Consider blood glucose monitoring if infant is at increased risk or is
symptomatic of hypoglycemia (see Fig. 18.2 for management).
7.	Monitor for stool/urine output. Most infants should have 1 void and 1
meconium stool within first 24 hours.6
8.	Monitor for excessive weight loss.
B. Prior to Discharge7
1.	Newborn metabolic screening: First screen typically performed within
first 72 hours of life, at least 24 hours after initiation of feeding (see
Chapter 13).
2.	Vaccinations: Hepatitis B vaccine (see Chapter 16).
3.	Critical congenital heart disease screening: Measure pre-­and/or postductal oxygen saturation (see Chapter 7).
4.	Newborn hearing screening.
5.	Document red reflex.
6.	Establish primary care.

Data from Apgar V. Proposal for a new method of evaluation of the newborn infant. Anesth Analg. 1953;32:260.

1.	Posture: Observe infant quiet and supine. Score 0 for arms, legs
extended; 1 for starting to flex hips and knees, arms extended; 2 for
stronger flexion of legs, arms extended; 3 for arms slightly flexed, legs
flexed and abducted; and 4 for full flexion of arms and legs.
2.	Square window: Flex hand on forearm enough to obtain fullest possible
flexion without wrist rotation. Measure angle between hypothenar eminence and ventral aspect of forearm.
3.	Arm recoil: With infant supine, flex forearms for 5 seconds, fully extend
by pulling on hands, then release. Measure the angle of elbow flexion to
which arms recoil.
4.	Popliteal angle: Hold infant supine with pelvis flat, thigh held in knee-­
chest position. Extend leg by gentle pressure and measure popliteal
angle.
5.	Scarf sign: With baby supine, pull infant’s hand across the neck toward
opposite shoulder. Determine how far elbow will reach across. Score 0
if elbow reaches opposite axillary line, 1 if past midaxillary line, 2 if past
midline, and 3 if elbow unable to reach midline.
6.	Heel-­to-­ear maneuver: With baby supine, draw foot as near to head as
possible without forcing it. Observe distance between foot and head
and degree of extension at knee.
D. Birth Trauma
1.	Extradural fluid collections: See Table 18.3 and Fig. 18.3.
2.	Fractured clavicle: Possible crepitus/deformity/decreased movement on
day 1 ± swelling/discomfort on day 2.
3.	Brachial plexus injuries: See Section XI.
E. Selected Anomalies, Syndromes, and Malformations (see Chapter 13
for genetic disorders)
1.	VACTERL association: Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects,
Tracheo-­Esophageal fistula, Renal anomalies, and Limb abnormalities.
2.	CHARGE syndrome: Coloboma, Heart disease, choanal Atresia, Retarded
growth and development (may include central nervous system anomalies), Genital anomalies (may include hypogonadism), and Ear abnormalities or deafness.
3.	Infant of a diabetic mother: Increased risk of hypoglycemia, polycythemia, transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), sacral agenesis,

Fortifier is generally added to breast milk after the 2nd week of
life.
b.	Iron: Preterm infants tolerating full enteral feeds require an elemental
iron supplementation of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day. Timing of initiation remains
controversial, generally after age 2 weeks.
c.	Vitamin D: Infants fed breast milk without fortifier require 400 IU
daily. Infants fed preterm formula require 200 IU/day. Infants fed full
term formula should be supplemented 400 IU/day until consuming 1
liter daily.

VI. RESPIRATORY DISEASES
A. General Respiratory Considerations
1.	Exogenous surfactant therapy:
a.	Indications: RDS in preterm infants, meconium aspiration, pneumonia, persistent pulmonary hypertension.
b.	Administration: If infant is ≤26 weeks gestation, first dose is typically
given in delivery room or as soon as stabilized; repeat dosing can be
considered based on ongoing oxygen requirements and level of respiratory support.
c.	Complications: Pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage.
2.	Supplemental O2: Adjust inspired oxygen to maintain O2 saturation. Ideal
target oxygen saturations vary based on factors such as gestational
age, chronologic age, and underlying conditions, and aims to minimize
adverse outcomes from hypoxemia and hyperoxemia. Higher targets
(>94%) can be used when the retinas are mature (see Section XIII) and
in cases of pulmonary hypertension.10
B. Respiratory Distress Syndrome
1.	Etiology: Deficiency of pulmonary surfactant resulting in increased surface tension and alveolar collapse. Surfactant is produced in increasing
quantities after 32 weeks gestation.

18

V. CYANOSIS IN THE NEWBORN
A. Differential Diagnosis
1.	General: Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, sepsis
2.	Cardiac: Congestive heart failure, congenital cyanotic heart disease
3.	Respiratory: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn
(PPHN), diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, choanal atresia,
pneumothorax, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), TTN, pneumonia,
meconium aspiration
4.	Neurologic: Central apnea, central hypoventilation, intraventricular
hemorrhage (IVH), meningitis
5.	Hematologic: Polycythemia, methemoglobinemia
6.	Medications: Respiratory depression from maternal medications (e.g.,
magnesium sulfate, narcotics, general anesthesia)
B. Evaluation
1.	Physical examination: Note central vs. peripheral and persistent vs.
intermittent cyanosis, respiratory effort, single vs. split S2, presence of
heart murmur. Acrocyanosis is often a normal finding in newborns.
2.	Clinical tests: Hyperoxia test (see Chapter 7) , preductal/postductal arterial blood gases or pulse oximetry to assess for right-­to-­left shunt, and
transillumination of chest for possible pneumothorax.
3.	Other data: Complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, serum
glucose, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography.
Consider blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures if sepsis is suspected
and methemoglobin level if cyanosis is out of proportion to hypoxemia.

aNeonates with severe respiratory distress syndrome.

Note: The use of antenatal corticosteroids in >34 weeks gestational age is controversial due to inconsistent data regarding efficacy and limited data regarding long-­term effects.

2.	Prevention:
a.	Antenatal maternal administration of steroids >24 hours and <7 days
prior to delivery, has been shown to decrease neonatal morbidity and
mortality.11-­14
(1)	Generally, either two doses of betamethasone administered 24
hours apart or four doses of dexamethasone given every 12 hours.
(2)	A single repeat course considered in women <34 weeks gestation
and whose previous steroid course was administered >14 days
prior. Serial courses not currently recommended.
b.	Other factors that accelerate lung maturity include maternal hypertension, sickle cell disease, narcotic addiction, intrauterine growth
retardation, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and fetal stress.
3.	Incidence: Table 18.8
4.	Risk factors: Prematurity, maternal diabetes, cesarean section without
antecedent labor, perinatal asphyxia, second twin, previous infant with RDS.
5.	Clinical presentation:
a.	Respiratory distress worsens during first few hours of life, progresses
over 48 to 72 hours, and subsequently improves.
b.	Recovery is accompanied by brisk diuresis.
c.	See Chapter 26 for imaging findings.
6.	Management:
a.	Ventilatory and oxygenation support
b.	Surfactant therapy
C. Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn
1.	Etiology: Idiopathic or secondary to conditions leading to increased
pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is most commonly seen in term
or postterm infants, infants born by cesarean section, and infants with a
history of fetal distress and low APGAR scores. It usually presents within
12 to 24 hours of birth:
a.	Vasoconstriction secondary to hypoxemia and acidosis
b.	Interstitial pulmonary disease (meconium aspiration syndrome,
pneumonia)
c.	Hyperviscosity syndrome (polycythemia)

d.	Pulmonary hypoplasia, either primary or secondary to congenital
diaphragmatic hernia or renal agenesis
2.	Diagnostic features:
a.	Severe hypoxemia (Pao2 <35 to 45 mmHg in 100% O2) disproportionate to radiologic changes.
b.	Structurally normal heart with right-­to-­left shunt at foramen ovale
and/or ductus arteriosus; pre/postductal oxygenation gradient (≥7 to
15 mmHg is significant).
c.	Must be distinguished from cyanotic heart disease. Infants with cyanotic heart disease will have an abnormal cardiac examination and
show little to no improvement in oxygen therapy or hyperventilation.
See Chapter 7 for interpretation of hyperoxia test.
3.	Principles of therapy:
a.	Improve oxygenation: Supplemental oxygen administration and optimization of oxygen-­carrying capacity with blood transfusions as indicated.
b.	Minimize pulmonary vasoconstriction:
(1)	Minimal handling of infant or noxious procedures. Sedation and
occasionally paralysis of intubated neonates may be necessary.
(2)	Avoid severe hyperventilation associated hypocarbia (PCO2 <30
mmHg), which can be associated with myocardial ischemia and
decreased cerebral blood flow. Hyperventilation may result in
barotrauma and predispose to chronic lung disease. Consider
high-­frequency ventilation.
c.	Maintenance of systemic blood pressure and perfusion: Reversal of
right-­to-­left shunt through volume expanders and/or inotropes.
d.	Consider pulmonary vasodilator therapy: see Chapter 1
(1)	Inhaled nitric oxide (NO): Reduces pulmonary vascular resistance
(PVR). Typical starting dose is 20 parts per million (ppm). Unlikely
to have additional benefit at >40 ppm. Complications include methemoglobinemia (reduce NO dose for methemoglobin >4%), NO2
poisoning (reduce NO dose for NO2 concentration >1 to 2 ppm).
(2)	Prostacyclin analog (e.g., epoprostenol): Pulmonary vasodilator,
normally produced by lung when lung vessels are constricted.
(3)	Sildenafil: Cyclic cGMP-­specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5)
inhibitor; results in pulmonary vasodilation.
e.	Broad-­spectrum antibiotics: Sepsis is a common underlying cause of
PPHN.
f.	Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): Reserved for
cases of severe cardiovascular instability, oxygenation index (OI) >40
for >3 hour, or alveolar-­arterial gradient (A-­aO2) ≥610 for 8 hours (see
Chapter 1 for OI and A-­a gradient equations). Infants typically need
to be >2000 g and at >34 weeks gestation to be ECMO candidates.
Obtain head ultrasound and consider EEG before initiating ECMO.
4.	Mortality depends on underlying diagnosis: Mortality rates are generally lower for RDS and meconium aspiration, but higher in sepsis and
diaphragmatic hernia.

Chapter 18 Neonatology  457

458  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
D. Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn
1.	Etiology: Incomplete or delayed resorption of amniotic fluid from the
lungs.
a.	Immaturity of respiratory epithelial Na+ transport.
2.	Risk factors: Birth by cesarean section, male sex, macrosomia,
lower gestational age, maternal diabetes, maternal asthma, maternal
smoking.
3.	Diagnostic features:
a.	Symptoms present within first 6 hours of delivery and resolve within
first postnatal week, usually within 72 hours.
b.	Tachypnea: greater than 60 breaths/min, often in the range of 80 to
100 breaths/min.
c.	Retractions, grunting, or nasal flaring may be present. Cyanosis and
hypoxia rare.
d.	CXR consistent with retained fluid: congestion, perihilar streaking,
fluid in the interlobar fissure.
e.	Exclusion of other diagnoses, i.e. pneumonia, aspiration, congenital malformations, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypoxic-­ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE), pneumothorax, acidosis, RDS.
4.	Management:
a.	NPO with gavage feedings or 10% dextrose-­containing fluids via IV.
b.	Supplemental oxygen and/or CPAP as indicated.
c.	No proven benefit of adjuncts including diuretics or racemic
epinephrine.
E. Pneumothorax
1.	Seen in 1% to 2% of normal newborns.
2.	Associated with use of high ventilatory pressures and underlying diseases such as RDS, meconium aspiration, and pneumonia.
3.	Consider monitoring in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
4.	Consider needle thoracostomy or chest tube placement (see Chapter 4).

VII. APNEA AND BRADYCARDIA
A. Apnea15
1.	Definition: Respiratory pause >20 seconds or a shorter pause associated
with cyanosis, pallor, hypotonia, or bradycardia <100 bpm. May be central
(no diaphragmatic activity), obstructive (upper airway obstruction), or
mixed.
2.	Etiology: See Fig. 18.4. Apnea of prematurity occurs in most infants
born at <28 weeks gestation, ∼50% of infants born at 30 to 32 weeks
gestation, and <7% of infants born at 34 to 35 weeks gestation. Usually
resolves by 34 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age, but may persist after
term in infants born at <25 weeks gestation.
3.	Management:
a.	Consider pathologic causes for apnea (e.g., meningitis, seizures).
b.	Pharmacotherapy with caffeine or other stimulants.

c.	Continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation (see
Chapter 1).
B. Bradycardia without Central Apnea
Etiologies include obstructive apnea, mechanical airway obstruction, gastroesophageal reflux, increased intracranial pressure, increased vagal tone
(defecation, yawning, rectal stimulation, and placement of nasogastric [NG]
tube), electrolyte abnormalities, heart block.

VIII. CARDIAC DISEASES
A. Patent Ductus Arteriosus
1.	Definition: Failure of ductus arteriosus to close in first 72 hours of life
or reopening after functional closure. Typically results in left-­to-­right
shunting of blood once PVR has decreased. If PVR remains high, blood
may be shunted right to left, resulting in hypoxemia (see Section VI.C).
2.	Epidemiology: Up to 60% in preterm infants weighing <1500 g and
higher in those weighing <1000 g. Female-­to-­male ratio is 2:1.
3.	Diagnosis:
a.	Examination: Systolic murmur may be continuous and best heard
at the left upper sternal border or left infraclavicular area. Bounding
peripheral pulses with widened pulse pressure if large shunt.
Hyperactive precordium and palmar pulses may be present.
b.	ECG: Normal or left ventricular hypertrophy in small to moderate patent ductus arteriosus (PDA); biventricular hypertrophy in large PDA.
c.	Chest radiograph: May show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary
vascular markings, depending on size of shunt.

d.	Echocardiogram
4.	Management:
a.	Indications for treatment, timing of intervention, and best management strategy remain controversial.16,17
b.	Indomethacin/Ibuprofen: Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor; 80%
closure rate in preterm infants
(1)	Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin but fewer renal adverse
effects.18
(2)	Complications16-­18: Transient decrease in glomerular filtration rate and decreased urine output, transient gastrointestinal bleeding (no increased incidence of necrotizing
enterocolitis [NEC]), prolonged bleeding time, and disturbed
platelet function for 7 to 9 days independent of platelet
count (no increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage).
Spontaneous isolated intestinal perforations are seen with
indomethacin use. Rates are higher with concomitant hydrocortisone use.
c.	Acetaminophen19-­22: Insufficient evidence but thought to be as effective as indomethacin/ibuprofen without effects on the kidneys and
platelets.
d.	Surgical ligation of the duct.
B. Cyanotic Heart Disease (See Chapter 7)

IX. HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES
A. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn23
1.	Overview:
a.	During first 3 to 4 days of life, total serum bilirubin (TSB) increases to
6.5 ± 2.5 mg/dL.
b.	Maximum rate of bilirubin increase for normal infants with nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia: 5 mg/dL/24 hr or 0.2 mg/dL/hr.
c.	Always consider clinical jaundice or TSB >5 mg/dL on first day of life
pathologic.
d.	Risk factors: Birth weight <2500 g, exclusive breastfeeding, prematurity, ABO incompatibility, cephalohematoma or significant bruising,
predischarge bilirubin in high-­risk zone, observed jaundice in first 24
hours, gestational age 35 to 36 weeks, infant of a diabetic mother,
previous sibling requiring phototherapy, low albumin, infection, race.
2.	Evaluation:
a.	Maternal prenatal testing: ABO and Rh (D) typing and serum screen
for isoimmune antibodies.
b.	Infant or cord blood: Blood and Rh typing (if maternal blood type
is O, Rh negative, or prenatal blood typing was not performed).
Consider hemoglobin, blood smear, glucose-­6-­phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) testing, direct Coombs test.

3.	Management:
a.	Phototherapy: Ideally, intensive phototherapy should produce a TSB
decline of 1 to 2 mg/dL within 4 to 6 hours, with further subsequent
decline. Guidelines:
(1)	Preterm newborn (Table 18.9)
(2)	Term newborn (Fig. 18.5)
b.	Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (>35 weeks gestational age): In
isoimmune hemolytic disease, IVIG administration (0.5 to 1 g/kg over
2 hours) is recommended if TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or TSB is within 2 to 3 mg/dL of exchange transfusion level
(see Chapter 15 for discussion of IVIG).

• Use total bilirubin. Do not subtract direct reacting or conjugated bilirubin.
• Risk factors: Isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant lethargy,
temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis, or albumin <3.0 g/dL (if measured)
• For well infants 35–37 6/7 wk, can adjust TSB levels for intervention around the medium risk line.
It is an option to intervene at lower TSB levels for infants closer to 35 wk and at higher TSB
levels for those closer to 37 6/7 wk.
• It is an option to provide conventional phototherapy in hospital or at home at TSB levels
2–3 mg/dL (35–50 mmol/L) below those shown, but home phototherapy should not be used in
any infant with risk factors.

• The dashed lines for the first 24 hours indicate uncertainty due to a wide range of clinical
circumstances and a range of responses to phototherapy.
• Immediate exchange transfusion is recommended if infant shows signs of acute bilirubin
encephalopathy (hypertonia, arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, fever, high-pitched cry)
or if TBS is ≥5 mg/dL (85 µmol/L) above these lines.
• Risk factors: Isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD deficiency, asphyxia, significant lethargy,
temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis.
• Measure serum albumin and calculate B/A ratio.
• Use total bilirubin. Do not subtract direct reacting or conjugated bilirubin.
• If infant is well and 35–37 6/7 wk (median risk), can individualize TSB levels for exchange
based on actual gestational age.

FIGURE 18.6
Guidelines for exchange transfusion in infants born at 35 weeks of gestation or more. B/A,
Bilirubin/albumin; G6PD, glucose-­6-­phosphate dehydrogenase; TSB, total serum bilirubin.

c.	Neonatal double-­volume exchange transfusion (see Table 18.9 and
Fig. 18.6):
(1)	Volume: 160 mL/kg for full-­term infant, 160 to 200 mL/kg for
preterm infant.
(2)	Route: During exchange, blood is removed through umbilical
arterial catheter (UAC) and an equal volume is infused through
UVC. If UAC is unavailable, use a single venous catheter.
(3)	Procedure: Replaces up to 85% of infant’s circulation. Exchange
in 15-­mL aliquots for full-­term infants. Exchange at 2 to 3 mL/kg/
min in premature/less stable infants to avoid hemolysis.
(4)	Complications: Emboli, thromboses, hemodynamic instability,
electrolyte disturbances, coagulopathy, infection, death.
NOTE: CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, bilirubin, Ca2+, glucose,
total protein, infant blood type, Coombs test, and newborn screen should
be performed on a preexchange sample of blood; they are of no diagnostic
value with postexchange blood. If indicated, save preexchange blood for
serologic or genetic studies.
B. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia (See Chapter 12)
1.	Definition: Direct bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL and >10% of TSB.

2.	Etiology: Biliary obstruction/atresia, choledochal cyst, hyperalimentation,
α1-­antitrypsin deficiency, hepatitis, sepsis, infections (especially urinary
tract infections), hypothyroidism, inborn errors of metabolism, cystic
fibrosis, red blood cell abnormalities.
3.	Management: Ursodiol for infants on full feeds; consider supplementation with fat-­soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K); otherwise depends on etiology. Phototherapy is not contraindicated but poses the risk for “bronze
baby” syndrome.
C. Polycythemia
1.	Definition: Venous hematocrit >65% confirmed on two consecutive
samples. May be falsely elevated when obtained by heel stick or falsely
lower when obtained by arterial stick.
2.	Etiologies: Delayed cord clamping, twin-­twin transfusion, maternal-­fetal
transfusion, intrauterine hypoxia, Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome,
maternal diabetes, neonatal thyrotoxicosis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, trisomies.
3.	Clinical findings: Plethora, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, tachypnea, hypoglycemia, irritability, lethargy, seizures, apnea, jitteriness,
poor feeding, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia.
4.	Complications: Hyperviscosity predisposes to venous thrombosis and
CNS injury. Hypoglycemia may result from increased erythrocyte utilization of glucose.
5.	Management: Partial exchange transfusion for symptomatic infants,
with isovolemic replacement of blood with isotonic fluid. Blood is
exchanged in 10-­to 20-­mL increments to reduce hematocrit to <55%.
Estimated blood volume = birth weight (kg) × 90 mL/kg

X. GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES
A. Necrotizing Enterocolitis
1.	Definition: Serious intestinal inflammation and injury thought to be secondary to bowel ischemia, immaturity, and infection. Occurs principally
in infants who have been fed.
2.	Risk factors: Prematurity, asphyxia, African American race, hypotension,
polycythemia–hyperviscosity syndrome, umbilical vessel catheterization, exchange transfusion, bacterial and viral pathogens, enteral feeds,
PDA, congestive heart failure, cyanotic heart disease, RDS, intrauterine
cocaine exposure.
3.	Clinical findings: See Table EC 18.B.
a.	Systemic: Temperature instability, apnea, bradycardia, metabolic
acidosis, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
b.	Intestinal: Blood in stool, absent bowel sounds, and/or abdominal
tenderness or mass. Elevated pregavage residuals in the absence of
other clinical symptoms rarely raise a suspicion of NEC.
c.	Radiologic: Ileus, intestinal pneumatosis, portal vein gas, ascites,
pneumoperitoneum (see Chapter 26).

TABLE EC 18.B
MODIFIED BELL’S STAGING SYSTEM FOR NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS

464  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
4.	Management: Nothing by mouth, NG tube decompression, maintain
adequate hydration and perfusion, broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 to
10 days based on hospital antibiogram, surgical consultation. Surgery is
performed for signs of perforation or necrotic bowel.
5.	Minimizing risk of NEC:
a.	Several studies link the use of probiotics and a decreased risk of
NEC.24 However, variations among formulations of probiotics, dosing, and lack of long-­term studies on outcome have prevented the
standard use of probiotics in the NICU.25
b.	There have been additional studies on supplements including
L-­arginine and lactoferrin.26-­28 Data remains insufficient to support a
practice recommendation.29
c.	The exclusive use of human milk, including donor breast milk, has
been shown to decrease the risk of NEC and associated mortality.30
B. Bilious Emesis
See Table EC 18.C and Chapter 12.
1.	Mechanical: Annular pancreas, intestinal atresia/duplication/malrotation/
obstruction (including adjacent organomegaly), meconium plug or ileus,
Hirschsprung disease, imperforate anus.
2.	Functional (i.e., poor motility): NEC, electrolyte abnormalities, sepsis.
NOTE: Must eliminate malrotation as an etiology because volvulus is a surgical emergency.
C. Abdominal Wall Defects (Table EC 18.D)
D. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (See Chapter 12)

XI. NEUROLOGIC DISEASES
A. Neonatal Hypoxic-­Ischemic Encephalopathy:
1.	Initial Management31
2.	Hypothermia protocol: Infants with evidence of HIE shortly after birth
who are >36 weeks gestation should be considered for hypothermia.
Protocol should be initiated within 6 hours of delivery.
3.	Criteria for hypothermia vary by center but typically include one or more
of the following:
a.	Cord gas or blood gas in the first hour of life with a pH of <7.0 or
base deficit of >16. For infants with a pH of 7.01 to 7.15 or base
deficit of 10 to 15.9, additional criteria should be met (e.g., significant perinatal event).
b.	10-­minute APGAR ≤5.
c.	Evidence of moderate to severe encephalopathy.
d.	Need for assisted ventilation at birth for at least 10 minutes.
4.	Severity and outcome of HIE in full-­term neonate: Table 18.10.
B. Intraventricular Hemorrhage
1.	Definition: IVH usually arises in the germinal matrix and periventricular
regions of the brain.

Data from MacDonald M, Mullett, M. Severity and outcome of hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy in full term neonate. In:
Avery’s Neonatology. 6th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2005.

2.	Incidence:
a.	30% to 40% of infants <1500 g; 50% to 60% of infants <1000 g
b.	Highest incidence within first 72 hours of life: 60% within 24 hours,
85% within 72 hours, and <5% after 1 week of age
3.	Diagnosis and classification:
a.	Ultrasonography; grade is based on maximum amount of hemorrhage seen by age 2 weeks:
(1)	Grade I: Hemorrhage in germinal matrix only
(2)	Grade II: IVH without ventricular dilation
(3)	Grade III: IVH with ventricular dilation
(4)	Grade IV: Periventricular hemorrhagic infarct with or without IVH.
NOTE: Many institutions use descriptive data (as opposed to the grading
system) to denote severity of IVH.
4.	Screening: Indicated in infants <32 weeks gestational age within 72
hours of life; repeat in 1 to 2 weeks.
5.	Outcome: Infants with grade III and intraparenchymal hemorrhages have
an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.

C. Periventricular White Matter Injury
1.	Definition and ultrasound findings: Ischemic necrosis of periventricular
white matter, characterized by CNS depression within first week of life
and later findings of cysts on ultrasound with or without ventricular
enlargement (caused by cerebral atrophy) or noncystic white matter
injury visualized by MRI.
2.	Incidence: More common in preterm infants but also occurs in term infants.
3.	Etiology: Primarily ischemia-­reperfusion injury, hypoxia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, acute hypotension, low cerebral blood flow.
4.	Outcome: Commonly associated with cerebral palsy with or without
sensory and cognitive deficits.
D. Neonatal Seizures (See Chapter 20)
E. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
1.	Onset of symptoms usually occurs within first 24 to 72 hours of life (methadone may delay symptoms until 96 hours or later). Symptoms may last
weeks to months. Box 18.1 shows signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
2.	Increasing evidence supports benefit of nonpharmacologic management,32 including rooming in, breastfeeding, skin-­to-­skin, swaddling,
and environmental controls such as decreased disruptions.
F. Peripheral Nerve Injuries
1.	Etiology: Result from lateral traction on shoulder (vertex deliveries) or
head (breech deliveries).
2.	Clinical features (Table 18.11).
3.	Management: Evaluate for associated trauma (clavicular and humeral
fractures, shoulder dislocation, facial nerve injury, cord injuries). Full
recovery is seen in 85% to 95% of cases in first year of life.

XII. UROLOGIC DISORDERS
A. Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction
1.	Definition: Rare birth defect caused by partial or complete blockage of
the urethra. Common causes include posterior urethral valves (PUV),
urethral atresia, and triad syndrome (constricted narrowing in mid-­
portion of urethra). More common in males.

2.	Diagnosis and Evaluation: Fetal anatomy ultrasound (18 to 24 weeks) with
visualization of markedly distended bladder, often with a thickened wall
(greater than 2 mm).33 A “keyhole” sign representing dilation of the posterior
urethral valve proximal to the obstruction may be seen, but is not specific.
a.	Other tests include comprehensive anatomic survey or fetal MRI,
echocardiogram, and karyotype to rule out co-­existing abnormalities
and determine gender. More than 10% of cases are associated with
Trisomy 13, 18, or 21.
b.	Vesicocentesis can evaluate renal function by serially assessing urine
electrolytes at 24 to 48 hour intervals.
3.	Clinical findings: Ureterectasis, caliectasis, hydronephrosis, pulmonary
hypoplasia, renal dysplasia, oligohydramnios, clubfeet, Potter facies.
4.	Management: Fetal vesicoamniotic shunting or cystoscopy. Consultation
with pediatric urology and nephrology to review postnatal course including dialysis, vesicostomy, and transplantation. Elective termination or
expectant management should be offered for fetuses with poor prognostic profiles (Table EC 18.E).
B. Bladder Exstrophy-­Epispadias-­Cloacal Exstrophy Complex
1.	Definition: Anomalies involving urinary tract eversion; with genitourinary,
musculoskeletal, and occasionally gastrointestinal malformations. See
Table EC 18.F for comparison.
2.	Diagnosis: Fetal anatomy ultrasound showing abnormality of bladder
filling, low-­set umbilical cord, abdominal mass that increases in size
throughout pregnancy, separation of pubic bones and small genitals.
3.	Management: Reconstructive surgery that aims to establish bladder
continence, preserve renal function, repair epispadias and genitalia,
and close the pelvic bones.

XIII. RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY34
A. Definition
Interruption of normal progression of retinal vascularization.
B. Etiology
Exposure of the immature retina to high oxygen concentrations can result
in vasoconstriction and obliteration of the retinal capillary network, followed
by vasoproliferation. Risk is correlated to degree of prematurity.
C. Diagnosis
Dilated funduscopic examination should be performed in the following
patients:
1.	All infants born ≤30 weeks gestation
2.	Infants born >30 weeks gestation with unstable clinical course, including those requiring cardiorespiratory support
3.	Any infant with a birth weight ≤1500 g
D. Timing35
1.	All infants born ≤27 weeks gestation, initial retinopathy of prematurity
(ROP) screening examination performed at 31 weeks postmenstrual age.

2.	All infants born ≥28 weeks gestation, initial ROP screening examination
performed at 4 weeks chronologic age.
3.	Infants born before 25 weeks gestation, consider earlier screening at 6
weeks chronologic age (even if before 31 weeks postmenstrual age) based
on the severity of comorbidities to enable earlier detection and treatment of
aggressive posterior ROP (a severe form of rapidly progressive ROP).

I. PRENATAL ASSESSMENT OF FETAL HEALTH
A. Fetal Anomaly Screening
1.	Fetal screening:
a.	Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): Segment of placenta obtained either
at 8 to 11 weeks gestation. Detects chromosomal abnormalities and
metabolic disorders; however, it cannot detect neural tube defects or
measure α-­fetoprotein (AFP). Complications include pregnancy loss
(0.7% to 2%), maternal infection, increased risk for feto-­maternal
hemorrhage, and fetal limb and jaw malformations.
b.	Amniocentesis: 20 to 30 mL of amniotic fluid is withdrawn under
ultrasound guidance after 16 to 18 weeks gestation. Detects chromosomal abnormalities, metabolic disorders, and neural tube defects.
Complications include pregnancy loss (0.06% to 1.0%), leakage
of amniotic fluid (1.7%), chorioamnionitis, vertical transmission to
infant in mothers with chronic viral infections, and fetal scarring or
dimpling of the skin.
c.	Cell free DNA is a noninvasive prenatal screening test available for
common trisomies and fetal sex determination. However, there are
still limitations to this testing and further diagnostic testing is typically
recommended for positive results.1
2.	Anatomy ultrasound: Performed at 18 to 20 weeks gestation.
3.	Maternal AFP: (Box EC 18.B)
B. Fetal Health
1.	Amniotic fluid volume estimation and amniotic fluid index (AFI): (Box EC
18.C). AFI is calculated using ultrasound by adding together width of
amniotic fluid pockets in four quadrants
2.	Biophysical profile test: (Table EC 18.H)
3.	Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) Monitoring:
a.	Normal baseline FHR: 120 to 160 beats/min (bpm). Mild bradycardia
is 100 to 120 bpm. Severe bradycardia is <90 bpm.
b.	Normal beat-­to-­beat variability: Deviation from baseline of >6 bpm.
Absence of variability is <2 bpm from baseline and is a sign of potential fetal distress, particularly when combined with variable or late
decelerations.
c.	Accelerations: Associated with fetal movements, are benign, and
indicate fetal well-­being.
d.	Decelerations:
(1)	Early decelerations: Begin with onset of contractions. Heart rate
reaches nadir at peak of contraction and returns to baseline as contraction ends. Early decelerations occur secondary to changes in vagal
tone after brief hypoxic episodes or head compression and are benign.
(2)	Variable decelerations: Represent umbilical cord compression
and have no uniform temporal relationship to the onset of a
contraction. Variable decelerations are considered severe when

heart rate drops to <60 bpm for about 60 seconds, with a slow
recovery to baseline.
(3)	Late decelerations: Occur after peak of contraction, persist after contraction stops, and show a slow return to baseline. Late decelerations
result from uteroplacental insufficiency and indicate fetal distress.
C. Estimation of Gestational Age
1.	Last menstrual period (LMP). Naegele rule gives most accurate determination of gestational age
Estimation due date = (LMP − 3 months) + 7 days
2.	Ultrasound: Crown-­rump length obtained between 6 and 12 weeks
gestation predicts gestational age ± 3 to 4 days. After 12 weeks,

A.	Common indications include: Infectious workup (urinary tract infection
[UTI], pyelonephritis), abdominal trauma, suspected diabetes or renal
disease, rhabdomyolysis, edema, failure to thrive.
B.	Best if urine specimen is evaluated within 1 hour of voiding, otherwise
should be kept at 4°C.
C.	Annual screening UAs are not recommended by the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) unless patient is at high risk of chronic
kidney disease.

II. KIDNEY FUNCTION TESTS
A. Tests of Glomerular Function
1.	Glomerulogenesis is complete at 36 weeks gestation. Glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) increases over the first two years of life related to
glomerular maturation.
2.	Normal GFR values, as measured by inulin clearance (gold standard),
are shown in Table 19.2.
3.	Creatinine clearance (CCr):
Closely approximates inulin clearance in the normal range of GFR.
When GFR is low, CCr overestimates GFR. May be inaccurate
in children with obstructive uropathy or problems with bladder
emptying secondary to challenges getting complete timed urine
collections.
CCr (mL / min / 1.73 m2) = [U× (V / P)] × 1.73 / BSA,

where U (mg/dL) = urinary creatinine concentration; V (mL/min)= total
urine volume (mL) divided by the duration of the collection (min) (24
hours = 1440 minutes); P (mg/dL) = serum creatinine concentration
(may average two levels); and BSA (m2) = body surface area.
4.	Estimated GFR (eGFR) from plasma creatinine: Varies related to body size/
muscle mass. If body habitus is markedly abnormal or a precise measurement of GFR is needed, consider other methods. Creatinine must
be in steady state to estimate GFR; use caution in the setting of acute
kidney injury. Three methods to calculate estimated GFR:

Data from Schwartz GJ, Brion LP, Spitzer A. The use of plasma creatinine concentration for estimating glomerular
filtration rate in infants, children, and adolescents. Pediatr Clin North Am. 1987;34:571.

a.	
Bedside Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) cohort: Only applicable
if creatinine measured by enzymatic assay. Recommended for eGFR
determination in children aged 1 to 16 years. Estimated GFRs of ≥75 mL/
min/1.73 m2 determined by this equation likely represent normal kidney
function; clinical correlation is recommended with GFR estimation.2
eGFR(mL / min / 1.73 m2) = 0.413× (L / Pcr),

where 0.413 is the proportionality constant, L = height (cm), and Pcr
= plasma creatinine (mg/dL).
b.	Schwartz equation: Historical equation for eGFR in children. However,
laboratories are increasingly shifting to enzymatic assays to determine
creatinine; use of enzymatically determined creatinine (vs Jaffe method)
with the Schwartz equation leads to overestimation of GFR and should
be considered when applying clinically:
eGFR(mL / min / 1.73 m2) = kL / Pcr,

where k = proportionality constant (Table 19.3); L = height (cm); and
Pcr = plasma creatinine (mg/dL).
c.	Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-­EPI): Used to calculate GFR in those
>18 years old. Available at NKDEP website (see Section XII).
5.	Other measurements of GFR: May be used when more precise determination of GFR is needed (e.g., dosing of chemotherapy). These
methods include iothalamate, DTPA, and iohexol. Cystatin C is a low
molecular protein that can also be used to estimate GFR and is more
accurate than serum creatinine in individuals with conditions that
significantly impact muscle mass, the source of creatinine.
B. Tests of Kidney Tubular Function
1.	Proximal tubule and solute handling:
a.	Proximal tubule reabsorption: Proximal tubule is responsible for reabsorption of electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids. Studies to evaluate

19

TABLE 19.3
PROPORTIONALITY CONSTANT FOR CALCULATING GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

476  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
proximal tubular function compare urine and blood levels of specific
compounds, arriving at a percentage of tubular reabsorption (Tx):
		Tx = 1 −[(Ux / Px)/(UCr / PCr)]×100 %,
where Ux = concentration of compound in urine; Px = concentration of
compound in plasma; Ucr = concentration of creatinine in urine; and
Pcr = concentration of creatinine in plasma. This formula can be used
for amino acids, electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus. It is commonly
used to calculate tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP). In a patient
with hypophosphatemia and preserved proximal tubular function, the
tubular reabsorption of phosphate would be expected to be near 100%.
b.	Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa)3: Commonly used to assess
tubular function. Must consider sodium and volume status. May be
inaccurate with recent diuretic use.
FENa = [(UNa / PNa) / (UCr / PCr)] × 100 %,
where UNa = concentration of sodium in urine; and PNa = concentration of sodium in plasma. FENa is usually <1% in prerenal azotemia or glomerulonephritis, and >1% (usually >3%) in acute tubular
necrosis (ATN) or postrenal azotemia. Infants have diminished ability
to reabsorb sodium; FENa in volume-­depleted infants is <3%.
c.	Fractional excretion of urea (FEurea): May be useful in certain clinical
scenarios, including patients on diuretics. Use FENa equation above,
substituting urea for sodium. FEurea is usually <35% in prerenal
azotemia and >50% in ATN.3
d.	Fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FHCO3): May help differentiate
the types of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The majority of bicarb
reabsorption occurs in proximal tubule.
FeHCO3 = [(UHCO3 / PHCO3 ) / (UCr / PCr)] × 100 %,
Normal FEHCO3 is <5%. Distal RTA is usually <5%. >15% suggests
proximal (Type II) RTA.
2.	Distal tubule and pH balance:
a.	Urine anion gap (UAG): Used as an indirect measure of ammonium
production in the distal nephron.
UAG = UNa + UK − UCl,
where UNa = concentration of sodium in urine; UK = concentration
of potassium in urine; and UCl = concentration of chloride in urine.
Positive UAG (usually >20) suggests a distal RTA. Negative UAG (usually <−20) suggests high urinary NH4+ (e.g., secondary to diarrhea).
b.	Urine pH: A urine acidification defect (distal RTA) should be suspected when random urine pH values are >6 in the presence of
moderate systemic metabolic acidosis. Confirm acidification defects
by simultaneous venous or arterial pH, plasma bicarbonate concentration, and determination of the pH of fresh urine.
c.	Urine osmolality: Urine is concentrated distally in the kidney tubules.
Urine osmolality, ideally on a first morning urine specimen, may be

used to evaluate capacity to concentrate urine. If osmolality is >600
mOsm/L, then tubular dysfunction, including disease states such as
diabetes insipidus leading to inappropriate water loss, is unlikely. For
more formal testing, see the water deprivation test in Chapter 10.
d.	Urine calcium: Hypercalciuria may be seen with distal RTA, vitamin D
intoxication, hyperparathyroidism, immobilization, excessive calcium
intake, use of steroids or loop diuretics, or an idiopathic cause.
Diagnosis is as follows:
(1).	24-­hour urine: Calcium >4 mg/kg/24 hr (gold standard)
(2).	Spot urine: Determine calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) ratio. Normal
urine Ca/Cr ratio does not rule out hypercalciuria. Correlate clinically and follow elevated spot urine Ca/Cr ratio with a 24-­hr urine
calcium determination if indicated (Table 19.4).4
III. CHRONIC HYPERTENSION5-­7
Note: See Chapter 1 for the management of acute hypertension and
Chapter 7 for normal blood pressure (BP) parameters.
A. Definition
Hypertension is defined as the sustained elevation of BP at or above the
95th percentile for those <13 years or ≥130/80 for those ≥13 years. Any
BP that is >90th percentile or ≥120/80 should be repeated at a clinic
visit; if persistently elevated when confirmed by manual auscultation,
the child should return for a repeat measurement for confirmation (see
Section III.E).
B. Measurement of Blood Pressure in Children
1.	All children ≥3 years should have BP measured annually. Children
≥3 years should have BP measured at all visits if at increased risk for
hypertension: obesity, taking medications known to increase BP, renal
disease, history of aortic arch obstruction/coarctation, diabetes.
2.	Children aged <3 years with risk factors should have BP measured
at all well-­child care visits. Risk factors include history of prematurity
<32 weeks gestation or small for gestational age, very low birth weight,
congenital heart disease, kidney/urologic disease or family history of

kidney disease, recurrent UTIs, malignancy, solid organ or bone marrow
transplant, taking medications known to increase BP, systemic illness
associated with hypertension, and evidence of increased intracranial
pressure.
3.	BP should be measured in a seated position in an upper extremity
after 5 minutes of rest with feet/back/arm supported and mid-­cuff at
heart level; auscultation is preferred. Appropriate cuff size has a bladder width at least 40% of upper arm circumference at midway point.
Bladder length should cover 80% to 100% of arm circumference. Cuffs
that are too small may result in falsely elevated BPs. Choose a larger-­
sized cuff if there is a choice between two.
C. Etiologies of Hypertension in Neonates, Infants, and Children
(Table 19.5)
Drugs causing hypertension include glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors,
sympathomimetics, oral contraceptives, stimulants (methylphenidate),
ephedrine, erythropoietin, NSAIDs, caffeine, tobacco, ethanol, cocaine,
amphetamines.
D. Evaluation of Chronic Hypertension
1.	Rule out factitious causes of hypertension (improper cuff size or
measurement technique [e.g., manual vs. oscillometric]), nonpathologic causes of hypertension (e.g., fever, pain, anxiety, muscle
spasm), and iatrogenic mechanisms (e.g., medications, excessive fluid
administration).

2.	History: Headache, blurred vision, dyspnea on exertion, edema,
obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (including poor sleep quality or
duration), endocrine symptoms (diaphoresis, flushing, constipation, weakness, etc.), history of neonatal intensive care unit stay, rule
out pregnancy, history of UTIs, history of medications and supplements, illicit drug use, or any family history of kidney dysfunction or
hypertension.
3.	Physical examination: Four-­extremity pulses and BPs, endocrine disease
stigmata, edema, hypertrophied tonsils, skin lesions, abdominal mass,
or abdominal bruit.
4.	Clinical evaluation of confirmed hypertension:
a.	Laboratory studies:
(1)	All patients: Urinalysis (UA), serum electrolytes, creatinine, blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), lipid profile
(2)	Obese patients: Hgb A1c, AST/ALT, fasting lipid panel
(3)	Consider on basis of history and exam: Fasting serum glucose,
thyroid stimulating hormone, drug screen, polysomnography,
complete blood count
b.	Clinical practice guidelines recommend 24-­hour ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring (ABPM) be conducted in all children with
persistently elevated blood pressure to confirm the diagnosis of
hypertension. Other at-­risk populations (e.g., coarctation of the aorta
status–post repair, CKD, history of hypertension) should also have
this monitoring done yearly regardless of clinic blood pressure.
c.	Imaging:
(1)	Renal ultrasound in patients <6 years old or those with abnormal
UA or renal function.
(2)	Echocardiography to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy if
pharmacologic treatment considered.
(3)	Consider renovascular imaging if renal artery stenosis is
suspected.
d.	Patients ≥6 years of age do not require extensive evaluation for
secondary causes if they have a strong family history of hypertension
(HTN), are overweight, and do not have any evidence of secondary
causes on history and physical exam.
E. Classification and Treatment of Hypertension (Table 19.6)
Target: SBP and DBP to <90th percentile and <130/80 mmHg in adolescents ≥13 years old. Consider target 50th percentile in those with CKD.
1.	Nonpharmacologic: Aerobic exercise, sodium restriction, smoking
cessation, and weight loss indicated in all patients with hypertension.
Reevaluate BP after lifestyle interventions, and begin pharmacologic
therapy if hypertension persists.
2.	Pharmacologic: Indications include secondary hypertension, symptomatic hypertension, stage 2 hypertension without a clearly modifiable factor (e.g., obesity), diabetes mellitus, and persistent hypertension despite
nonpharmacologic measures.

F. Antihypertensive Drugs for Outpatient Management of Primary
Hypertension in Children 1 to 17 Years of Age
Clinical guidelines recommend angiotensin-­converting-­enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin II receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, or long-­acting calcium
channel blockers as first-­line medications for management of chronic
hypertension in children.6 Medication choice may be impacted by underlying comorbidities, contraindications, and side effects. Providers should
familiarize themselves with existing guidelines, medication contraindications, and side effects. A list of medications and common side effects is
found in Table 19.7.

IV. URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS8-­13
A. History
Highly dependent on patient age. Inquire about fever, dysuria, frequency,
urgency, and back/abdominal pain. Obtain voiding history (stool, urine),
stream characteristics in toilet-­trained children, sexual activity, sexual
abuse, circumcision status, prolonged/bubble baths or swimming, evaluation of growth curve, recent antibiotic use, and family history of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), recurrent UTIs, or chronic kidney disease.
B. Physical Examination
Vital signs, abdominal examination for tenderness, flank masses, bowel
distention, evidence of impaction, meatal stenosis or circumcision in
males, vulvovaginitis or labial adhesions in females, neurologic examination
of lower extremities, perineal sensation and reflexes, and rectal and sacral
examination (for anteriorly placed anus).

C. Risk Factors
2011 AAP guidelines,8 reaffirmed in 2016,9 for children 2 to 24 months
provide resources to help clinicians stratify the risk of UTI in the absence of
another source of infection in a febrile child.
1.	Females are at higher risk for UTI than males.
2.	Uncircumcised males are at higher risk than circumcised males.
3.	Other risk factors include non-­black race, fever ≥39°C, and fever >1 to 2 days.
D. Methods of Urine Collection
1.	If a child is 2 months to 2 years old, has a fever, and appears sufficiently
ill to warrant immediate antibiotics, obtain UA and urine culture by
transurethral catheterization. Suprapubic percutaneous aspiration may
be useful in critically ill children, is generally very safe, and is similar to
bladder catheterization in sensitivity and specificity.
2.	If a child is 2 months to 2 years old, has a fever, and does not appear ill enough
to warrant immediate antibiotics, obtain urine by catheterization or the most
convenient method available. Bag or absorbent pad may be helpful when UTI
is unlikely (to rule out infection), but both have very high false positive rates
(>75% of cultures positive) and should not be sent for culture.8 If UA does not
suggest UTI, it is reasonable to avoid antimicrobial therapy. If UA does suggest
UTI, urine culture should be obtained by catheterization.
3.	If a child is >2 years old and toilet trained, may provide midstream
clean-­catch urine specimen.
E. Diagnosis
To establish the diagnosis of UTI, both UA results suggestive of infection
and positive urine culture are recommended.
1.	Nitrite test:
a.	Detects products of reduction of dietary nitrates by urinary gram-­
negative bacterial species (especially Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and
Proteus).
b.	Sensitivity 15% to 82% and specificity 90% to 100% for UTI.8
c.	Special circumstances: False-­negative (low sensitivity) results
commonly occur with insufficient time (<4 hours) for conversion of
urinary nitrates to nitrites (age-­dependent voiding frequency) and
inability of bacteria to reduce nitrates to nitrites (many gram-­positive
organisms such as Enterococcus, Mycobacterium spp., and fungi).
2.	Leukocyte esterase test:
a.	Detects esterase released from leukocyte lysis.
b.	Sensitivity 67% to 84% and specificity 64% to 92% for UTI.8
3.	Pyuria is defined at a threshold of ≥5 WBCs/hpf. Absence of pyuria is
rare if a true UTI is present.
4.	Urine culture:
a.	Transurethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration: >50,000
colony-­forming units (CFU) per mL diagnostic of UTI. Some sources
suggest >10,000 CFU/mL in the presence of fever, symptoms, and
pyuria may also be diagnostic.10

19

Chapter 19 Nephrology  483

484  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
b.	Clean catch: >100,000 CFU/mL necessary to diagnose a UTI.
c.	Bagged specimen: Should not be used to collect urine culture.
d.	Catheter-­associated (indwelling urethral or suprapubic): No specific
data for pediatric patients. Adult Infectious Diseases Society of
America guidelines define it as presence of symptoms and signs
compatible with UTI and >1000 CFU/mL of one or more bacterial
species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided
urine specimen from a patient whose catheter has been removed
within previous 48 hours.11
F. Classification
Pyelonephritis (upper UTI), rather than cystitis (lower UTI), is suggested
by fever ≥38.5°C (especially if lasting >48 hours after initiating appropriate
antibiotics), systemic symptoms, costovertebral angle tenderness, elevated
CRP, leukocytosis.
G. Imaging
1.	Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS): Evaluates for anatomic abnormalities
and abscesses. Indications include children 2 to 24 months with first UTI,
recurrent or atypical UTIs, or if no response to treatment within 48 hours. If
there is clinical improvement <48 hours and follow up is reliable, should be
done after full recovery. If there is no response to treatment or follow up is
uncertain, then RBUS during illness is indicated.
2.	Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG): Evaluates bladder anatomy, emptying, and looks for signs of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Should not be
obtained routinely after first febrile UTI. Indications include children 2
to 24 months with abnormal RBUS findings (hydronephrosis, scarring,
or other findings suggestive of either high-­grade VUR or obstructive
uropathy), complicated or recurrent pyelonephritis.8 Consider if family
history of VUR. Optimal time is 2 to 6 weeks after infection.
H. Treatment of Culture-­Positive Urinary Tract Infection
For empiric therapy, see Chapter 17.
1.	Organisms:
a.	E. coli is the most common cause of pediatric UTI.
b.	Other common pathogens: Klebsiella, Proteus spp., Staphylococcus
saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
c.	Neonatal UTI: Group B streptococci and other bloodborne
pathogens.
d.	Enterococcus and Pseudomonas are more prevalent in abnormal
hosts (e.g., recurrent UTI, abnormal anatomy, neurogenic bladder,
hospitalized patients, or those with frequent bladder catheterizations). Consider blood cultures if urine grows uncommon organism or
Staphylococcus.
2.	Treatment considerations and duration:
a.	Route: Parenteral antibiotics for children who are toxic, dehydrated, or unable to tolerate oral medication due to vomiting or
noncompliance.

b.	Duration: 3 to 5 days for uncomplicated cases12; 7 to 14 days for
toxic children and those with pyelonephritis.
3.	Inadequate response to therapy: Consider renal abscess or urinary
obstruction; RBUS and repeat urine culture is indicated. Repeat cultures should also be considered in patients with recurrent UTIs to rule
out persistent bacteriuria.
4.	Management of VUR:
a.	Classification of VUR: Fig. 19.1
b.	Antibiotic prophylaxis: Evidence suggests that prophylactic
trimethoprim-­sulfamethoxazole reduces the risk of UTI recurrence
by 50%, but with no significant difference in renal scarring. Some
experts suggest that recent studies are insufficiently powered
to detect a difference in the relatively rare outcomes of renal

486  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
scarring, and thus recommend shifting guideline recommendations from “no prophylaxis” to “selective prophylaxis” in certain
groups of patients.13
c.	Surgical intervention: Monitor persistence/grade of VUR annually, often
in consultation with a pediatric urologist. Spontaneous resolution may
occur, although less likely with higher grade. Higher-­grade VUR that
persists as the child grows may ultimately require surgical intervention.
5.	Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Defined as bacteria in urine on microscopy
and Gram stain in an afebrile, asymptomatic patient without pyuria.
Antibiotics not necessary if voiding habits and urinary tract are normal.
6.	Referral to pediatric urology: Consider in children with abnormal voiding
patterns based on history or imaging, neurogenic bladder, abnormal
anatomy, recurrent UTI, or poor response to appropriate antibiotics.

V. PROTEINURIA14–16
A. Definitions
1.	Orthostatic proteinuria: Excretion of significant amounts of protein while
in the upright position. A benign condition and common cause of proteinuria in children and adolescents.
2.	Fixed proteinuria: Proteinuria found on first morning urine void over
several consecutive days. Suggestive of kidney disease.
3.	Microalbuminuria: Presence of albumin in urine below detectable range
of dipsticks. In adults, defined as 30 to 300 mg/g creatinine. Most often
used in screening for kidney disease secondary to diabetes.
4.	Significant proteinuria: Urine protein to urine creatinine (UPr:UCr) ratio
0.2 to 2.0 mg/mg or 4 to 40 mg/m2/hr in a 24-­hour collection.
5.	Nephrotic-­range proteinuria: UPr:UCr ratio >2 mg/mg or >40 mg/m2/
hr in a 24-­hour collection. In adults, 24-­hour urine protein excretion of
3000 mg/24 hours.
6.	Nephrotic syndrome: Nephrotic-­range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia,
edema, and hyperlipidemia (cholesterol >200 mg/dL).
B. Methods of Detection
1.	Urinalysis (see Table 19.1): Proteinuria on a urine dipstick should be
verified by a urine protein/creatinine ratio in an appropriately collected
first morning urine specimen. Urine samples collected immediately
upon rising in the morning help distinguish the contribution of benign
orthostatic proteinuria to the proteinuria detected on dipstick or randomly timed spot urine collection.
2.	First morning urine protein/creatinine ratio:
a.	Approximates 24-­hour urine collections well.
b.	Appropriate collection is essential for accurate results. A child must
empty the bladder before going to bed. If the child gets up during
the night, the bladder should be emptied before returning to bed.
When the child wakes up in the morning, the urine sample should be
provided immediately.

BOX 19.1
CAUSES OF PROTEINURIA
Transient proteinuria: Caused by fever, exercise, dehydration, cold exposure,
seizure, stress
Orthostatic proteinuria
Glomerular diseases with isolated proteinuria: Idiopathic (minimal change disease)
nephrotic syndrome, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, mesangial proliferative
glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy, sickle cell nephropathy
Glomerular diseases with proteinuria as a prominent feature: Acute postinfectious
glomerulonephritis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy
Tubular disease: Cystinosis, Wilson disease, acute tubular necrosis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, renal dysplasia, toxic tubular injury
(medications, heavy metals)

c.	Normal ratios:
(1)	<2 years old: <0.5 mg/mg
(2)	>2 years old: <0.2 mg/mg
d.	Abnormal ratios (mg/mg): Significant proteinuria detected on a first
morning protein/creatinine ratio should prompt verification of appropriate collection. Repeat specimen should be analyzed within 1 to 2
weeks, or sooner based on clinical scenario (e.g., edema, hypertension, or symptom of concern would prompt a more expedited workup).
3.	24-­hour urine protein: May have a contribution from benign orthostatic
proteinuria, which cannot be ruled out without a fractional urine collection. Protein level >4 mg/m2/hr is considered significant.
C. Etiologies (Box 19.1)
See Section VI.E for discussion of nephrotic syndrome.
D. Evaluation15
Further evaluation is necessary if proteinuria is significant/symptomatic and
not secondary to orthostatic proteinuria (Box 19.2).
E. Nephrotic Syndrome16
1.	Epidemiology: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood is the most
common form, representing approximately 90% of cases in children
between the ages of 1 and 10 years. Minimal change disease is the
most common renal pathology found among children with idiopathic
nephrotic syndrome in this age group. Nephrotic syndrome may be a
manifestation of a primary kidney disease, a systemic disorder resulting
in glomerular injury, or rarely medication.
2.	Clinical manifestations: Hypoalbuminemia and decrease in oncotic pressure results in generalized edema. Initial swelling commonly occurs on the
face (especially periorbital), as well as in the pretibial area. Eye swelling is
often mistaken for allergic reactions or seasonal allergies (Box 19.3).

3.	Etiologies: See Table 19.8.
4.	Investigations at first presentation: UA and microscopy (microhematuria
present in 30% and is not prognostic); urine P/Cr ratio; serum albumin,
total protein, cholesterol, creatinine; infectious workup (consider tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, as indicated).
5.	Management of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood: Empirical
corticosteroid treatment without kidney biopsy is recommended for
children without atypical features. Hospitalization recommended for
children with overwhelming edema or infection.

a.	Steroid-­responsive: Approximately 95% of patients with minimal
change disease (MCD) and 20% with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) achieve remission within 4 to 8 weeks of starting prednisone. Response to corticosteroids is the best prognostic indicator,
including the likelihood of underlying MCD.
(1)	Although duration of therapy varies, one common regimen
includes prednisone 60 mg/m2 daily or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum
dose 60 mg/day) for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg
on alternate days for 6 weeks.16
(2)	Relapses of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are treated with a
shorter duration of corticosteroids, which also vary according to
the center and the consensus body. Commonly, prednisone 60
mg/m2 or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 60 mg/day) until urine
protein is negative for 3 consecutive days, followed by 40 mg/m2
or 1.5 mg/kg on alternate days for 4 weeks.
b.	Frequently relapsing: Defined as 2 or more relapses within 6 months
of initial response, or 4 or more relapses in any 12-­month period.
c.	Steroid-­dependent: Defined as 2 consecutive relapses during tapering or within 14 days of cessation of steroids. Some patients can be
managed with low-­dose steroids, given daily or on alternate days, but
many will relapse. Second-­line treatments for frequently relapsing and
steroid-­dependent nephrotic syndrome: Cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), calcineurin inhibitors, levamisole, or rituximab.
d.	Steroid-­resistant: Lack of remission or partial remission after 8 weeks
of corticosteroids. Second-­line agents, including calcineurin inhibitors
or MMF, are often introduced once steroid resistance is confirmed.
e.	Indications for renal biopsy: Macroscopic hematuria, age <12
months or >12 years, systemic or syndromic findings, persistent
creatinine elevation >1 to 2 weeks, low complement levels, and persistent proteinuria after 4 to 8 weeks of adequate steroid treatment.17
6.	Complications:
a.	AKI; thromboembolic disease; potentially life-­threatening infection.
See Chapter 16 for vaccine recommendations.
b.	Chronic systemic steroids: Cushingoid skin changes, cataracts,
accelerated atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, gastric ulcer, mood swings,
insomnia, insulin resistance, immunosuppression.

VI. HEMATURIA18
A. Definition
1.	Microscopic hematuria: >5 RBCs/hpf on centrifuged urine. Not visible to
the naked eye.
2.	Macroscopic (gross) hematuria: Visible blood in urine.
3.	Acute nephritic syndrome: Classically tea or cola-­colored urine, facial or
body edema, hypertension, and oliguria.
B. Etiologies: See Table 19.9.

C. Evaluation (Fig. 19.2)
Differentiate glomerular and extraglomerular hematuria: Examine urine sediment, looking for RBC casts and protein.
1.	Glomerular hematuria
a.	Usually hypertensive; dysuria usually absent; edema, fever, pharyngitis, rash, and arthralgia may suggest glomerular disease.
b.	Laboratory: Dysmorphic RBCs and casts on UA, complete blood
cell count (CBC) with differential and smear, serum electrolytes with
calcium, BUN/creatinine, serum protein/albumin, and other testing
driven by history and exam, including ANA, hepatitis B and C serologies, HIV, audiology screen, if indicated.
c.	Consider other studies to determine underlying diagnosis: C3/C4,
antineutrophil antibody (c-­and p-­antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), anti–double-­stranded DNA
2.	Extraglomerular hematuria
a.	Rule out infection: Urine culture, gonorrhea, chlamydia
b.	Rule out trauma: History, consider imaging of abdomen/pelvis
c.	Investigate other potential causes: Urine Ca/Cr ratio or 24-­hour
urine for kidney stone risk analysis, sickle cell screen, renal/bladder
ultrasound. Consider serum electrolytes with calcium, coagulation
studies.
D. Management (Fig. 19.3)

VII. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY19,20
A. Definition
Sudden decline in kidney function; clinically represented by rising creatinine, with or without changes in urine output.
B. Etiology (Table 19.10)
Causes are generally subdivided into three categories:
1.	Prerenal: Impaired perfusion of kidneys, the most common cause of
acute kidney injury (AKI) in children. Volume depletion is a common
cause of prerenal AKI.
2.	Renal:
a.	Parenchymal disease due to vascular or glomerular lesions.
b.	Acute tubular necrosis: Diagnosis of exclusion when no evidence of
renal parenchymal disease is present and prerenal and postrenal
causes have been eliminated, if possible.
3.	Postrenal: Obstruction of the urinary tract, commonly due to inherited
anatomic abnormalities in children.
C. Clinical Presentation
Pallor, decreased urine output, systemic and pulmonary edema, hypertension,
vomiting, and lethargy. The hallmark of early kidney failure is often oliguria.
1.	Oliguria: Urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr (for at least 6 hours). May reflect
intrinsic or obstructive kidney disease. Always interpret urine output in
the context of physical exam, clinical scenario, and fluid delivery.

For example, low urine output may be appropriate (physiologic
response to water depletion in a prerenal state) and “normal” urine
output may be inappropriate in a volume-­depleted patient (potentially
representing kidney tubular damage or another pathologic state).
Laboratory differentiation of oliguria is found in Table 19.11.

b.	>20: Suggests volume depletion, prerenal azotemia, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
c.	<5: Suggests liver disease, starvation, or inborn error of metabolism.

D. Acute Tubular Necrosis
Clinically defined by three phases:
1.	Oliguric phase: Period of severe oliguria that may last days. If oliguria or
anuria persists for longer than 3 to 6 weeks, kidney recovery from ATN
is less likely.
2.	High urine output phase: Begins with increased urine output and
progresses to passage of large volumes of isosthenuric urine containing
sodium levels of 80 to 150 mEq/L.
3.	Recovery phase: Signs and symptoms usually resolve rapidly, but polyuria may persist for days to weeks.
E. Treatment Considerations
1.	Careful monitoring of volume status (daily weights, strict input/
output). Consider placement of indwelling catheter to monitor urine
output.
2.	Prerenal and postrenal factors should be addressed or excluded.
3.	Intravascular volume resuscitation and maintenance with appropriate
fluids in consultation with a pediatric nephrologist.
4.	Monitor metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities, discontinue unnecessary
nephrotoxic medications and follow drug levels closely when available, adjust dosing of medications based on creatinine clearance (see
Chapter 31), monitor blood pressure closely, and maintain appropriate
nutrition (low phosphorus, low potassium).
5.	See Section IX for indications for acute dialysis
F. Complications
1.	Dependent on clinical severity.
2.	Usually includes fluid overload (hypertension, congestive heart failure
[CHF], or pulmonary edema), electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia),
metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and uremia.
G. Radiographic Imaging Considerations in AKI/CKD
1.	To prevent radiographic contrast-­induced nephropathy, select radiographic studies that do not require administration of a radiographic
iodinated contrast media (RICM) if possible, particularly in high-­risk
populations, such as patients with AKI or CKD.21
2.	If RICM is required, use of low or iso-­osmolality contrast media is
preferred.21
3.	Hydration has been found to be effective in preventing or minimizing
contrast-­induced nephropathy in some studies of high-­risk populations.
Intravenous hydration 6 hours prior to and 6 to 12 hours after contrast
administration has been studied.21
4.	Use of N-­acetylcysteine is controversial in preventing contrast-­induced
nephropathy.21
5.	Gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: The triad of gadolinium
use, a pro-­inflammatory state, and renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min
per 1.73 m2, peritoneal or hemodialysis) is associated with nephrogenic

19

Chapter 19 Nephrology  495

496  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
systemic fibrosis. Gadolinium is contraindicated in patients with GFR
<30 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and caution should be used at GFR levels
between 30 and 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2.22

VIII. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE23
A. Definition
Kidney damage for >3 months, as defined by structural or functional
abnormalities, with or without decreased GFR. Classified as:
Stage I: Kidney injury with normal or increased GFR
Stage II: GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage III: GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage IV: GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2
Stage V: GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis
B. Etiology
1.	Children <5 years: Most commonly due to congenital abnormalities
(e.g., kidney hypoplasia/dysplasia, urologic malformations).
2.	Older children: More commonly acquired glomerular diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis, FSGS) or hereditary disorders (e.g., Alport syndrome).
C. Clinical Manifestations (Table 19.12)
D. General Management
1.	Nutrition: Growth should be monitored closely; supplemental nutrition
should be considered if not reaching caloric goals, which are higher in
children with CKD. Potassium and sodium restriction may be required
in advanced CKD. Growth hormone therapy may be considered in
consultation with pediatric nephrology/endocrinology.
2.	Anemia: Evaluate with CBC and iron studies. Iron deficiency is common and should be treated with oral (preferred) or IV iron. Consider
erythropoietin-­stimulating agents in consultation with pediatric
nephrology.
3.	CKD–mineral and bone disorder: Characterized by phosphate retention,
decreased free calcium, and decreased 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D. Serum
calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D, and parathyroid
hormone should be regularly monitored. Control phosphate with phosphate binders, supplement with calcium and vitamin D, as indicated.
4.	Cardiovascular: Regularly monitor blood pressure and lipid panel.
Treating hypertension slows the progression of CKD.

IX. DIALYSIS
A. Indications for Acute Dialysis
When metabolic or fluid derangements are not controlled by aggressive
medical management alone. Should be initiated in consultation with a
nephrologist. Generally accepted criteria include the following:
1.	Acidosis: Intractable metabolic acidosis.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

498  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
2.	Electrolyte abnormalities: Hyperkalemia >6.5 mEq/L despite restriction
of delivery and medical management; calcium and phosphorus imbalance (e.g., hypocalcemia with tetany, seizures in the presence of a very
high serum phosphate level); derangements implicated in neurologic
abnormalities.
3.	Ingestion or accumulation of dialyzable toxins or poisons: Lithium,
ammonia, alcohol, barbiturates, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, methanol,
salicylates, theophylline. Consult poison control experts when available.
4.	Volume overload: Evidence of pulmonary edema or hypertension.
5.	Uremia: BUN >150 mg/dL (lower if rising rapidly), uremic pericardial
effusion, neurologic symptoms.
B. Techniques
1.	Peritoneal dialysis (PD): Requires catheter to access peritoneal cavity, as well as adequate peritoneal perfusion. May be used acutely or
chronically. Contraindications: Abdominal wall defects (omphalocele,
gastroschisis, bladder exstrophy, diaphragmatic hernia), severe inflammatory bowel disease, or infectious source in the abdomen.24
2.	Intermittent hemodialysis (HD): Requires placement of special vascular
access catheters. May be method of choice for certain toxins (e.g.,
ammonia, uric acid, poisons) or when there are contraindications to
peritoneal dialysis.
3.	Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis (CAVH/D) and
continuous venovenous hemofiltration/hemodialysis (CVVH/D): Requires
special vascular access catheter. Lower efficiency of solute removal compared with intermittent hemodialysis, but higher efficiency is not necessary because of the continuous nature of this form of dialysis. Sustained
nature of dialysis allows for more gradual removal of volume/solutes,
which is ideal for patients with hemodynamic or respiratory instability.
C. Complications
1.	PD catheter leaks: Confirm leakage of PD fluid with glucose dipstick.
Discontinue PD for 7 to 10 days or lower dialysate volume.
2.	PD associated peritonitis (PDAP): Acute clouding of dialysate, abdominal
pain/distention, vomiting. Culture peritoneal fluid and start empiric intraperitoneal antibiotics in consultation with nephrology. Refer to published
Consensus Guidelines for treatment recommendations.25
3.	Intradialytic hypotension in HD: Causes include rapid fluid removal,
pre-­dialysis antihypertensive medication, bradykinin release, hypotonic
dialysate. Reduce or pause ultrafiltration.

X. TUBULAR DISORDERS
A. Renal Tubular Acidosis (Table 19.13)26

2.	Results in a persistent normal anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic
acidosis.
3.	RTA syndromes have a normal GFR and often do not progress to kidney
failure.
4.	Clinical presentation may be characterized by failure to thrive, polyuria,
constipation, vomiting, and dehydration.
5.	Fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FeHCO3) should be checked after a
HCO3 load. Can help differentiate the types of RTA. See Section II.B for
equation.
6.	Urine anion gap (UAG) is also useful; however, it should not be used
when a patient is volume depleted or has an anion-­gap metabolic acidosis. See Section II.B for equation.

19

TABLE 19.13
RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS

500  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
B. Fanconi Syndrome
1.	Generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule resulting not only in
bicarbonate loss but also in variable wasting of phosphate, glucose, and
amino acids.
2.	May be hereditary, as in cystinosis and galactosemia, or acquired
through toxin injury and other immunologic factors.
3.	Clinically characterized by rickets and impaired growth.
C. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus
1.	Water conservation is dependent on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and its
effects on the distal renal tubules. Polyuria (urine output >5 mL/kg/hr
or >2 L/day), a hallmark of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), is
due to diminished or lack of response of the ADH receptor in the distal
renal tubules. Hereditary defects of ADH receptor or acquired insults
(e.g., interstitial nephritis, sickle cell disease, lithium toxicity, CKD) may
underlie NDI.
2.	Must be differentiated from other causes of polyuria: Central diabetes
insipidus (ADH deficiency that may be idiopathic or acquired through
infection or pituitary trauma; see Chapter 10), diabetes mellitus, psychogenic polydipsia, cerebral salt wasting.

XI. NEPHROLITHIASIS27-­30
A. Risk Factors
Male sex; history of UTI (especially those <5 years); congenital and structural urologic abnormalities (urinary stasis), neurogenic bladder, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria/oxalosis, hypocitraturia, other metabolic abnormalities;
family history of stones, renal failure, consanguinity.
B. Presentation
1.	Microscopic hematuria (90%), flank/abdominal pain (50% to 75%),
gross hematuria (30% to 55%), and concomitant UTI in up to 20%.
2.	Have higher likelihood than adults of having asymptomatic stones,
especially younger children.
C. Diagnostic Imaging
1.	Ultrasonography is an effective and preferred modality, particularly
at centers with expertise, given benefit of avoiding radiation exposure
(75% sensitive for renal stones).29
2.	Noncontrast CT may be preferred to improve diagnostic sensitivity (e.g.,
with radiolucent stones such as uric acid stones, ureteral stones, lack of
ultrasonographic expertise).
D. Management
1.	Pain control, urine culture, hydration. Some centers initiate α-­blockers
to facilitate stone passage, although evidence of benefit in children is
equivocal.30-­32

2.	Antibiotics: Should be considered in treatment of all stones, especially if
fever and/or pyuria present, because of the high association with UTI.
3.	Urologic intervention (e.g., extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy): Consider with unremitting
pain, urinary obstruction, increasing stone size, size ≥7 mm, or cystine/
struvite stone, especially in the setting of AKI or at-­risk patients (e.g.,
solitary kidney, anatomic anomalies).32
4.	Strain urine to collect stone; analyze stone composition to aid in prevention of future stones.
E. Workup
1.	Up to 75% of children with a kidney stone will have a metabolic abnormality (e.g., hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, cystinuria).
2.	Workup should include analysis of the stone (if possible); UA; basic
metabolic panel; and serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and uric
acid levels. If evidence of elevated calcium or phosphate, obtain parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and consider checking 25-­and 1,25(OH)
vitamin D levels.
3.	After symptoms have resolved, a 24-­hour urine collection should be
obtained. Risk factors for stone formation should be analyzed: urine
volume, osmolarity, sodium, calcium, urate, oxalate, citrate, and cystine.
This test is also referred to as a “stone risk analysis.”
F. Prevention
1.	All children with history of stones should increase fluid intake (e.g., at
least 2 L/day in those aged >10 years old).
2.	Targeted interventions of any identified metabolic abnormalities
(e.g., low-­sodium diet in those with hypercalciuria). Pharmacologic
interventions are also available in certain scenarios (e.g., citrate
supplementation).
3.	Dietary Modifications: Long–term adherence (5 years) to normal calcium, low–sodium diet may decrease recurrence of stones in people
with idiopathic hypercalciuria with recurrent nephrolithiasis.33

I. NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION
A. Mental Status
Alertness, orientation (person, place, time, situation), language, cognition
1.	Infants: Observe “cuteness” and ability to dynamically engage caretakers.
2.	Toddlers: Bring toys. Observe and engage in play.
3.	School age: Ask children to draw or describe school or friends.
B. Cranial Nerves (Table EC 20.A)
1.	For a quick assessment of cranial nerves for all patients, observe:
a.	(II) Visual response to objects in each visual quadrant.
b.	(III, IV, VI) Conjugate gaze at full lateral and vertical positions, nystagmus.
c.	(VII) Symmetry and expressiveness of face at rest and with emotive
activation.
d.	(VIII) Finger rub, or response to and localization of sound for infants.
e.	(IX, X, XII) Quality of phonation and articulation; ask about feeding,
chewing, swallowing.
C. Motor
1.	Muscle bulk: Atrophy is a red flag.
2.	Tone: Spasticity, rigidity, hypotonia.
a.	Infants: Observe infant undressed to assess resting posture (varies
with age). Active tone: traction response, axillary stability (slip-­
through), posture in horizontal suspension. Passive tone (resistance
of movements of the joints): flap hands/feet, scarf sign.
b.	Red flags: Scissoring, toe-­walking, inability to supinate hand, clasped
thumb or grasp.
3.	Strength:
a.	Observe ease of normal functions: rising from floor, standing broad
jump, running, climbing onto chair or exam table. Note presence
of accommodations child is making in order to execute movements
(e.g., shoulder shrug or trunk tilt to raise arm).
b.	For conventional rating scale, see Box 20.1.
4.	Involuntary movements: Fasciculations, tics, dystonia, chorea, athetosis,
tremor.
D. Sensory
1.	Primarily important if any concern for spinal cord defect or peripheral
nerve injury.

0/5: No movement (i.e., no palpable tension at tendon)
1/5: Flicker of movement
2/5: Movement in a gravity-­neutral plane
3/5: Movement against gravity but not resistance
4/5: Subnormal strength against resistance (requires accommodation to execute
movement)
5/5: Normal strength against resistance (motion is smooth, comfortably executed,
without any accommodations)

2.	Focus initial investigation along three axes for meaningful lesion localization:
a.	Distal deficit with preserved (or less impaired) proximal sensation
suggests polyneuropathy.
(1)	Pain/temperature deficit: small fiber polyneuropathy/anterior
spinal cord.
(2)	Position/vibration deficit: large fiber polyneuropathy/posterior
spinal cord.
b.	Lower body more affected than upper body suggests spinal cord
injuries.
(1)	See Fig. 20.1 for dermatomes.
(2)	Ask about continence.
c.	If difference between left and right, concern for unilateral brain or
spinal cord lesion.
E. Reflexes
1.	Tendon Reflexes: Gradation (Box 20.2) and localization (Table EC 20.B).
Helpful in localizing abnormalities including upper versus lower motor
neuron pathology, especially in presence of weakness or asymmetry
(Table EC 20.C). Compare right to left, upper to lower extremities, and
distal to proximal reflexes. Generalized high or low reflexes of little
significance in setting of normal strength and coordination.
2.	Primitive reflexes: Expected during specific time windows (Table 20.1).
F. Coordination and Gait
1.	Evaluate coordination while watching age-­appropriate activities.
2.	Tests for cerebellar function: Rapid alternating movements, finger-­to-­
nose, heel-­to-­shin, walking, running.

II. HEADACHES1–11
A. Classification of Headaches
1.	Primary headaches: Migraines, tension-­type, cluster, trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs), other primary headache disorders.
2.	Secondary headaches: Trauma, infection, substance use or withdrawal, vascular disorder, neurologic disorder, increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
3.	Differential diagnosis: Acute (Box 20.3) and chronic (Box 20.4)

B. Evaluation of Headaches
Obtain history (Box 20.5) and physical exam (Table EC 20.D); evaluate
for red flags (Box 20.6). If red flags present, obtain appropriate imaging
(computed tomography [CT] for hemorrhage, magnetic resonance imaging/
angiography (MRI/MRA) for vascular abnormalities). Perform lumbar puncture (LP) if concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage (not detected on CT),
infection, or increased ICP (Box 20.7). If no red flags present and normal
neurologic exam, imaging and LP not recommended.

BOX 20.5
IMPORTANT HISTORICAL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING HEADACHE
1.	
When did the headaches begin?
2.	
How did the headache begin? Associated trauma, social stressors (school,
home)?
3.	
What is the frequency and duration of the headaches?
a.	
Headache pattern (intermittent, progressive, chronic, etc.)
b.	
Time of day
4.	
Where is the pain, what is it like, and does it radiate? Focal occipital pain is
concerning for secondary headaches.
5.	
Associated symptoms? What do you do during the headache?
a.	
Aura or prodrome
b.	
Constitutional symptoms (weight changes), vision changes, or any other
neurologic symptoms (weakness, tingling, photophobia, phonophobia)
c.	
Triggers and alleviating/exacerbating factor
6.	
Other history (e.g., health problems, medications, family history of migraine)
7.	
How do the headaches affect your ability to function? Ask about school
absences.

C. Migraine Headache
1.	Migraines can be throbbing, pulsatile, or pressure-­like in children.
Usually bifrontal in children and unilateral in adolescents and adults.
There are many potential triggers (e.g., stress, caffeine, menses, sleep
disruption). See Box 20.8 for diagnostic criteria.
2.	Classification1: With versus without aura. An aura is any neurologic
symptom that occurs prior to onset of a migraine (e.g., visual aberrations, paresthesias, numbness, dysphasia).
3.	Precursors to migraines and close associations: Cyclic vomiting, abdominal migraines, paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, paroxysmal torticollis of
infancy, and motion sickness.
4.	Treatment: Combination of acute and prophylactic treatment.
a.	Acute symptomatic: Avoid medication overuse (no more than 2 to 3
days/week); can lead to rebound headaches. Optimal acute therapy
can prevent progression to chronic migraines.
b.	Outpatient setting:
(1)	Dark, quiet room and sleep.
(2)	Acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) (e.g., naproxen, ibuprofen, ketorolac).
(3)	Caffeine (e.g., coffee, tea, soda).
(4)	Triptans: Not typically used in emergency room or inpatient
setting (only effective at migraine onset). Limit use to twice per
week.

1.	
See Chapter 4 for indications, contraindications, and procedure.
2.	
Standard tests: Cell counts + differential, Gram stain, CSF culture, protein,
glucose. Consider viral studies (e.g., herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, etc.).
3.	
Manometer for OP if concern for increased intracranial pressure. Performed
in a lateral decubitus position. OP of <28 cm H2O generally considered normal; however, interpret results in concert with other clinical and examination
findings.
4.	
There is inconsistent evidence regarding correction factors for CSF white
blood cell counts in the setting of blood-­contaminated CSF from a traumatic
lumbar puncture.
5.	
Xanthochromia: Yellow or pink discoloration of CSF due to breakdown of
hemoglobin. Suspect subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid; OP, opening pressure.

(5)	Antidopaminergics have antiemetic properties, though effective
even if nausea is not a predominant factor. Prochlorperazine
shown to be superior to metoclopramide.48 Sometimes more
effective than NSAIDs in emergency department setting.
c.	Emergency department (ED)/inpatient setting:
(1)	Often helpful to combine medications and administer intravenous
(IV) “migraine cocktail” (see Fig. 20.2 for example ED algorithm).
(2)	Steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) may be useful in intractable
cases, although evidence is lacking.

GER in infancy. Paroxysmal dystonic posturing (back arching) associated with meals.
Myoclonus

Involuntary muscle jerking or twitch

ECG, Electrocardiography; EEG, electroencephalography; GER, gastroesophageal reflux; REM, rapid eye movement.

b.	Complex febrile seizure: Seizure associated with a fever that is
focal, lasts for >15 minutes, or recurs within a 24-­hour period.
Management: Identify the source of fever. Consider EEG, neuroimaging. Consider prescribing rectal diazepam for home emergency use.
Slightly increased risk of developing epilepsy at later age.

4.	Evaluation of unprovoked seizures
a.	Rule out provocative factors: Obtain vitals. Consider checking
glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, complete blood
cell count, toxicology screen.
b.	EEG is recommended in all children with first unprovoked seizure to
evaluate for an epilepsy syndrome, however it does not need to be
emergently obtained.14 Interictal EEGs may be normal, particularly in
children with focal seizures. Repeat EEGs, prolonged EEG monitoring
with video as clinically indicated.
c.	Imaging: High resolution MRI can assist with identification of underlying brain malformation, although is not routinely indicated when
evaluating a first-­time seizure. CT scan is not recommended.
5.	Epilepsy: Recurrent, unprovoked seizures or diagnosis of genetic
syndrome characterized by recurrent seizures. Assess seizure type,
epilepsy classification (Table EC 20.F),15–17 and severity of disorder. See
Table 20.3 for selected epilepsy syndromes of childhood.
6.	Breakthrough seizures: Assess for missed medications or significant
weight gain, lack of sleep, stress, drugs/alcohol, physical exertion, illness, dehydration, flickering lights, menses, and drug interactions that
can lower seizure threshold (tricyclic antidepressants, certain antibiotics,
over-­the-­counter cold preparations, diphenhydramine, herbal supplements). Obtain drug levels (see Table 20.4 for therapeutic drug levels).
7.	Status epilepticus22: Traditionally defined as continuous seizure activity
lasting approximately > 5 minutes or two discrete seizures without
return of consciousness between them. See Chapter 1 for management.
8.	Treatment19,20,23–25
a.	First seizure, nonfocal, and with return to baseline: No antiseizure
drug indicated. Overall recurrence approximately 50% in 2 to 5
years. Epileptiform abnormalities on EEG indicate a higher chance of
recurrence.
b.	Educate parents and patient regarding seizure safety.20 Review
seizure first aid, including supervision during bathing or swimming.
Be aware of driver’s license laws in the state. Advocate teacher and
school awareness.
c.	Pharmacotherapy (see Table 20.4): Initiate if known etiology of seizure (diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome), recurrent unprovoked seizure
(risk of recurrent seizure >80% after second unprovoked seizure).
Choose therapy according to seizure type. Consider rectal diazepam
if seizures are prolonged or hemodynamic instability.
d.	Ketogenic diet25:
(1)	High-­fat, low-­carbohydrate therapy typically used for intractable
seizures.
(2)	Should be managed by trained providers.
(3)	Urine/serum ketones can be monitored to assess compliance.
(4)	Side effects include transient GI upset and hyperlipidemia,
chronic metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, fractures.

516  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
(5)	Factor in carbohydrate content of formulations when prescribing
medications to child on ketogenic diet.
(6)	Avoid dextrose-­containing IV fluids.
e.	Surgical therapies considered for children with identified seizure focus
located in noneloquent cortex and/or failed antiseizure drug therapies.
(1)	Device implantation: Vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, responsive neurostimulation (NeuroPace).
(2)	Resections: Hemispherectomy, focal resection (e.g., temporal
lobectomy), corpus callosotomy.

IV. HYDROCEPHALUS26–28
A. Etiology
Communicating (due to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] reabsorption)
versus noncommunicating (due to obstruction of CSF flow) and congenital
versus acquired (postinfectious, posthemorrhagic, due to mass lesions).
B. Diagnosis
1.	Clinical signs: apneas, bradycardias, macrocephaly, increasing head
circumference (HC), bulging/tense fontanelle, splayed sutures, headaches, blurry/spotty vision, decreased level of consciousness, “setting-­
sun” eye sign due to upward gaze paresis, vomiting, Cushing triad
(hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations), papilledema, CN
palsies (III, IV, VI).
2.	In infants, obtain serial measurements of HC. Obtain neuroimaging if
significant increase in HC percentile or if patient is symptomatic.
3.	Imaging: Ultrafast MRI preferred to CT where available (see Chapter 26).
C. Treatment
1.	Medical:
a.	Emergently manage acute increase of ICP (see Chapter 1).
b.	Slowly progressive hydrocephalus: Acetazolamide and furosemide may provide temporary relief by decreasing the rate of CSF
production.
2.	Surgical: CSF shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).
a.	Ventriculoperitoneal shunts used most commonly.
b.	Patients with shunt dysfunction often present with signs of increased
ICP. Causes include infection, obstruction (clogging or kinking), disconnection, migration of proximal or distal tips, valve programming.
c.	Evaluation of shunt integrity: See Chapter 26 for discussion of imaging. Consult pediatric neurosurgery (if available).

combined with ataxia and myoclonus. Postinfectious or paraneoplastic
(neuroblastoma/neural crest tumors) etiology.
8.	Hydrocephalus
9.	Infection: labyrinthitis, abscess
10.	Seizure: ictal or postictal
11.	Vascular events: cerebellar hemorrhage or stroke

C. Management
1.	Stroke team activation (where available) or urgent neurology consultation, along with transfer to a tertiary care center with expertise in childhood stroke.
2.	Supportive care and neurologic monitoring. Maintain normoglycemia,
maintain normothermia (avoid fevers). Monitor for signs of increased
ICP.
3.	Optimize cerebral perfusion pressure: Ensure adequate fluid volume and
maintenance of median blood pressure (BP) for age, allow permissive
hypertension.
4.	Reperfusion therapies: Not routinely recommended in children due to
lack of evidence, but an active area of research. Thrombolytic therapy
with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy
may be considered under appropriate circumstances in centers with
extensive pediatric stroke experience (American Heart Association
guidelines).
5.	Children with sickle cell disease: Consult a hematologist. Hydration and
emergent exchange transfusion to reduce sickle hemoglobin to <30%
(see Chapter 14).

2.	Encephalitis: Inflammation of brain parenchyma due to infection or
inflammatory response.
B. Selected Causes of Encephalopathy (Box 20.12)
C. Diagnosis
Targeted based on clinical scenario and associated symptoms. See Chapter 1
for emergency management of acute altered level of consciousness. Further
workup based on suspected etiology. May require serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies for infectious/inflammatory/metabolic markers, EEG,
neuroimaging (e.g., MRI or PET).
D. Treatment
Dependent on etiology. See Chapter 1 for emergency management of acute
altered level of consciousness. See Chapter 17 for treatment of meningitis.

VIII. NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS38–45
A. Spinal Muscular Atrophy38,39
1.	Etiology: Motor neuron degeneration caused by autosomal recessive
mutations in SMN1 gene with resulting insufficient levels of SMN protein. Severity correlates inversely with copy number of SMN2.
2.	Clinical features: Varying degrees of symmetric and progressive,
proximal more than distal, muscle weakness with preserved cognition.
Patients with severe forms do not survive past early childhood without
treatment due to respiratory failure.
3.	Treatment: Evaluation of weak/hypotonic infant for possible spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA) is urgent, as effective treatment (nusinersen
[Spinraza]) is possible, but magnitude of benefit decreases with
time.

20

BOX 20.12
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ENCEPHALOPATHY

520  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
B. Duchenne or Becker Muscular Dystrophy40
1.	Etiology: X-­linked mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
gene, encoding dystrophin, causes disruption of muscular cytoskeleton. Mostly affects males. Duchenne form is more severe and caused
by complete disruption of dystrophin; partial disruption causes milder
Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).
2.	Clinical features: Delayed motor milestones. Progressive proximal symmetric muscle weakness starting in early childhood leading to wheelchair use for mobility by age 13. Elevated serum CK levels.
3.	Treatment: Corticosteroids (prednisone or deflazacort [Emflaza]) are
mainstays.41 Requires multidisciplinary management: At high risk for
cardiomyopathy and respiratory and orthopedic complications. Novel
disease-­modifying agent, eteplirsen (Exondys 51), limited to patients
with specific DMD mutations.
C. Myasthenia Gravis42
1.	Etiology: Autoantibodies binding the acetylcholine receptor impair
neuromuscular junction function. Subtypes include transient neonatal
myasthenia (due to transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies from
mother with myasthenia), congenital myasthenic syndrome (genetic
defects of neuromuscular junction proteins), and juvenile (classic autoimmune in children).
2.	Clinical features: A key feature is fatigable, variable weakness. Often
concentrates in orbital muscles (double vision, ptosis, ophthalmoparesis), or bulbar weakness (slurred/nasal voice, difficulty chewing, swallowing, talking). Can also manifest with generalized weakness of limbs
and trunk. Triggers include illness, fever, heat, and some medications.
Bulbar weakness can worsen with illness and compromised airway. A
good bedside test of bulbar muscle fatigue is the “slurp test.”43 Ask
patient to imbibe four ounces of water through a straw quickly—if consumption slows after 1 or 2 ounces, at risk of bulbar decompensation;
if marked slowing or times especially prolonged, at risk for respiratory
failure.
3.	Treatment: Refer to/consult specialist for management.
a.	Myasthenic crisis/rapid onset of symptoms: plasmapheresis, IVIG,
and IV neostigmine. Evaluate the need to secure definitive airway.
b.	Chronic management:
(1)	Oral pyridostigmine
(2)	Prednisone (caution about paradoxical worsening with any large
initial dose)
(3)	Immunosuppressive medications (e.g., mycophenolate,
rituximab)
(4)	Thymectomy may be helpful
D. Acute Guillain-­Barré Syndrome44,45
1.	Etiology: Presumed immune attack against peripheral nerve myelin. In
some cases, triggered by illness, notably Campylobacter jejuni infection.

2.	Clinical features and diagnosis: Rapid decline with nadir less than two
weeks after onset; respiratory status can be compromised. Back pain
often prominent in children. Often with autonomic instability. Elevated
spinal fluid protein without cellular infiltrate (“albumocytologic dissociation”). Nerve conduction studies can be helpful.
3.	Treatment: Patients should be hospitalized at presentation to monitor for
respiratory stability. Acute phase treatment with IVIG, plasmapheresis
helpful if initiated early. Supportive care.
4.	Variants of Guillain-­Barré syndrome (GBS)
a.	Acute: Miller Fisher syndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
b.	Chronic: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
is a similar but slower progressive autoimmune disorder that often
requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy.
E. Infantile Botulism46
1.	Etiology: Affects infants <1 year of age, most commonly <6 months,
due to colonization of colon by Clostridium botulinum bacteria (infants
are susceptible due to immaturity of gut flora). Botulinum toxin released
into bloodstream, irreversibly cleaves protein complex necessary for
acetylcholine vesicle release into neuromuscular junction.
2.	Clinical features and diagnosis: Subacute onset weakness of skeletal
muscles diffusely, concentrating in eye, face, and bulbar muscles early.
Weak pupil constriction responses common and specific when present.
Presenting symptom often constipation for days to weeks before onset
of weakness, poor feeding, and weak cry. At high risk for respiratory
failure due to respiratory and bulbar muscle weakness. Tachycardia
is common. Confirmation of diagnosis by toxin assay of stool (not
culture) performed by state lab or CDC; may use minimal amount of
sterile, nonbacteriostatic water colonic enema for specimen collection. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can help confirm
diagnosis.
3.	Treatment: Assess and stabilize airway: approximately 50% of infants
require intubation/advanced airway. Treat with one-­time dose of human
botulism immune globulin (BabyBIG or BIG-­IV), available through Infant
Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program (http://www.infantbotulis
m.org/). Prompt treatment is key; do not wait for confirmatory testing.
With appropriate treatment, prognosis for full recovery is excellent. See
Chapter 16 for recommended interval before measles or varicella vaccination after botulism immune globulin administration.

Nutrition and Growth
Jaime La Charite, MD, MPH
I. ASSESSMENT OF GROWTH
A. Types of Growth Charts
1.	Child <24 months: World Health Organization (WHO) international
growth charts1
2.	Child ≥2 years: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
growth charts2
3.	Growth charts for premature infants
a.	Corrected age = infant’s chronologic age − number of weeks of prematurity (using 40 weeks as full-­term gestation) and should be used
up to 3 years.3,4
b.	Chronologic age should be used if child’s growth “catches up” before
3 years.5
c.	Oslen, Bertino, and Fenton growth charts can be used to assess
growth in premature infants up to 41 weeks (Oslen) to 50 weeks
(Fenton).6 After 4 to 8 weeks post-­term, the WHO growth chart can
be used.7
d.	The choice of growth chart has some variability across practice sites
and preferences.8
4.	Special populations9,10
a.	WHO or CDC growth charts are recommended in all cases due to
limited reference data for condition-­specific growth charts.
b.	Condition-­specific growth charts can show families how a specific
condition can alter growth potential.
c.	Growth charts have been created for Down syndrome, Prader-­Willi
syndrome, Williams syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Turner
syndrome, and Marfan syndrome.
B. Interpretation of Growth Charts11,12
1.	Stunting/short stature: Length or height <5th percentile
2.	Underweight:
a.	Children <2 years: Weight for length/height <5th percentile
b.	Children ≥2 years: Body mass index (BMI) for age <5th percentile or
BMI <18.5 kg/m2
3.	Healthy weight: BMI for age 5th percentile to <85th percentile or BMI
18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2
4.	Overweight:
a.	Children <2 years: Weight for length/height >95th percentile
523

524  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
b.	Children ≥2 years: BMI for age ≥ 85th to <95th percentile or BMI 25
to 29.9 kg/m2
5.	Obese:
a.	Children <2 years: No consensus definition exists
b.	Children ≥2 years: BMI for age ≥95th percentile or BMI ≥30 kg/m2
C. General Guidelines Regarding Appropriate Growth13,14
1.	Term infants usually lose approximately 5% to 10% of their birth weight,
but regain the weight within 2 weeks.
2.	Infants should gain 20 to 30 g/day from birth to 3 months, 15 to 22 g/
day from 3 to 9 months, and 6 to 11 g/day from 9 to 12 months.
3.	Term infants double their birth weight in 4 to 5 months and triple it by 1
year of age.
4.	Height doubles from birth to age 3 to 4 years of age.
5.	The average size of a 4-­year-­old is 40 in. and 35 lb.
6.	From age 3 to 10 years of age, children grow an average of 2.5 inches
per year.

II. MANAGEMENT OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN
A. AAP Recommendations for the Prevention of Obesity15-­17
1.	Exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age and then breastfeeding
maintenance until at least 12 months.
2.	Daily breakfast and family meal times.
3.	Limit sugary beverages, fast food, energy-­dense foods, and encourage
fruits and vegetables.
4.	Develop a family media plan with limits and technology-­free zones.
For infants less than 18 months, no media other than video chatting.
If media used with toddlers 18-24 months, parents should watch and
engage with children during use. For children 2 to 5 years, a max of one
hour of high-­quality programming a day with co-­viewing when possible.
5.	Recommend 60 minutes of moderate-­to-­vigorous exercise per day.
B. Prevention and Management of Obesity in the Primary Care Setting
(Table 21.1)
C. Conditions Associated with Obesity15
1.	Endocrine:
a.	Polycystic ovarian syndrome
b.	Precocious puberty
c.	Pre-­diabetes/Type 2 diabetes
2.	Gastrointestinal:
a.	Cholelithiasis
b.	Gastroesophageal reflux
c.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
3.	Neurologic: Pseudotumor cerebri
4.	Orthopedic:
a.	Blount disease
b.	Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)

Further follow-­up and management for those who are overweight or obese:
(a) At each follow-­up, record weight, measure blood pressure, and use an empathetic and empowering counseling style
(e.g., motivational interviewing).
(b) Establish goals: Positive behavior change, weight maintenance, or decrease in BMI velocity. Children aged 2 to
5 years who have obesity should not lose more than 1 pound/month; older children and adolescents with obesity
should not lose more than an average of 2 pounds/week.
(c) If no improvement after 3 to 6 months, refer to structured weight management program. If no improvement after 3
to 6 months, the next step is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. If no improvement, refer for evaluation
at a tertiary care center for medication management and weight reduction surgery.

Chapter 21 Nutrition and Growth   527

528  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
4.	If the child’s length has decelerated and is below 50%, can screen for
hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency.
5.	If recurrent or severe upper respiratory or opportunistic infections,
consider testing for human immunodeficiency and tuberculosis and
measuring immunoglobulin and complement levels.
6.	Based on clinical suspicion, can consider celiac screening, sweat chloride testing, echocardiogram, hepatitis serology, stool studies.
7.	Consider hospitalization for observed feeding if the child fails outpatient
management, suspicion for abuse/neglect or traumatic injury, severe
psychological caregiver impairment, serious malnutrition, or at risk for
re-­feeding.
G. Red Flags That Suggest a Medical Cause of Malnutrition20
1.	Developmental delay or dysmorphic features
2.	Cardiac findings (e.g., murmur, edema, jugular venous distension)
3.	Failure to gain weight despite adequate calories
4.	Organomegaly or lymphadenopathy
5.	Recurrent or severe respiratory, mucocutaneous, or urinary infections
6.	Recurrent vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration
H. Approach to the Management of Malnourished Patients21,22 (Box
21.1)
1.	Address the etiology of malnutrition.
2.	Approximately 20% to 30% more energy may be required to achieve
catch-­up growth in children. This should continue until the previous
growth percentiles are regained.
3.	Catch-­up linear growth may lag several months behind weight.
4.	See Box 21.1 for instructions on the calculation of catch-­up growth
requirements.
BOX 21.1
DETERMINING CATCH-­UP GROWTH REQUIREMENTS
1.	Plot the child’s height and weight on the appropriate growth charts.
2.	Determine recommended calories required for age [recommended dietary
allowances (RDA)].
3.	Determine the ideal weight (50th percentile) for child’s height.
4.	Multiply the RDA calories by ideal body weight for height (kg).
5.	Divide this value by the child’s actual weight (kg). For example, for a
12-­month-­old boy whose weight is 7 kg and length is 72 cm, RDA for age would
be 98 kcal/kg/day, and ideal body weight for height is 9 kg (50th percentile

5.	Screen for food insecurity and offer social work and community
resources.
6.	Pharmacotherapy (e.g., cyproheptadine, megestrol) may be helpful for
patients with significant underlying diseases (e.g., cancer, cystic fibrosis).

A. Patients at Risk of Developing Re-­Feeding Syndrome23
1.	Chronic malnutrition (e.g., prolonged fasting ≥5 days, malignancy)
2.	Renal/endocrine (e.g., chronic diuretic use, diabetic hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar syndrome)
3.	Gastrointestinal loss (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatitis, short bowel)
4.	Infectious (e.g., AIDS, tuberculosis)
5.	Cardiac (e.g., congenital heart disease)
6.	Pulmonary (e.g., cystic fibrosis)
7.	Psychiatric (e.g., anorexia nervosa, chronic alcohol use)
8.	Social (e.g., child abuse/neglect, homelessness, food insecurity)
B. Management of Re-­Feeding Syndrome24
1.	Maintain continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring or check vital signs
every 4 hours, depending on level of concern.
2.	Ensure strict intake and output monitoring with calorie count and daily
weights.
3.	Obtain at least daily basic metabolic panel with phosphorous and
magnesium. Obtain more frequently if electrolyte replacement needed,
or if there are concerning trends.
4.	Measure pre-­albumin, albumin, zinc.
5.	Consider giving thiamine 100 to 300 mg PO daily (or 50 to 100 mg IV) ×
3 days before feeding. There is some debate whether this is required.
6.	Give a multivitamin daily.
7.	Feeding should not proceed without appropriate supplementation.
8.	Recommendations vary, but start at 1/4 to 1/2 of estimated caloric
needs depending on degree of risk.
9.	Dietary advancement over 3 to 7 days with caloric increases of 10% to
25% per day until recommended caloric goals achieved.
10.	Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral feeding.

experts recommend a level of 20 to 30 ng/mL as being sufficient. These are the Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatrics
guidelines used for dosing.
NOTE: 1,25-­dihydroxy vitamin D is the physiologically active form, but 25-­hydroxy vitamin D is the value to monitor for
vitamin D deficiency as it approximates body stores of vitamin D.

e.	At risk children (e.g., cystic fibrosis) and those with laboratory confirmed vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should also be
supplemented.
f.	See Table 21.6 for interpreting vitamin D levels.
2.	Folate27,28
a.	All women capable of becoming pregnant should consume 400 mCg
from supplements or diet.
b.	This should continue as women enter prenatal care.
c.	If a woman had a prior pregnancy with a neutral tube defect and
is planning another pregnancy, she should consume 4 mg of folic
acid daily (requires a prescription) at least 4 weeks before becoming
pregnant and continue through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
D. Mineral Requirements (Table 21.7)
1.	Iron29
a.	Breast-­fed term infants should receive 1 mg/kg/day of an oral iron
supplement beginning at 4 months of age, preferably from iron-­
fortified cereal or, alternatively, elemental iron.
b.	Breast-­fed preterm infants should receive 2 mg/kg/day by 1 month of
age, which should continue until the infant is weaned to iron-­fortified
formula or begins eating complementary foods.
c.	Formula-­fed term infants receive adequate iron from fortified formula.
d.	Formula-­fed preterm infants need 2 mg/kg/day, which is the amount
supplied by iron-fortified formulas.
2.	Fluoride30
a.	Consider fluoride supplementation for those patients who use bottled
water or home filtration systems. Some home water treatment systems can reduce fluoride levels.
b.	For infants and children at high risk for the development of caries,
fluoride supplementation ranging from 0.25-1 mg/day is recommended according to the American Dental Association’s schedule.
c.	Fluoridated toothpaste is recommended for all children starting at
tooth eruption, using a smear (grain-of-rice-sized) until age 3 and
then a pea-­sized amount after that time.

VI. BREASTFEEDING AND THE USE OF HUMAN MILK
A. Benefits of Breast Milk31
1.	Decreased risk of infections (e.g., otitis media, respiratory), necrotizing
enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
2.	Decreased incidence of atopic conditions, obesity, and diabetes.
B. Contraindications to Breastfeeding32,33 (Box 21.2)
1.	Tobacco smoking is not contraindicated but is strongly discouraged
because of an association with increased risks of SIDS, respiratory
disease, and infections in exposed infants.
2.	Alcohol should be limited to the occasional intake of 2 oz of liquor, 8 oz
of wine, or two beers for the average 60 kg woman >2 hours prior to the
onset of nursing.
3.	Methadone and buprenorphine are not contraindications, if the mother
is in a stable maintenance program and not using street drugs.
C. Use of Milk Bank Donor Human Milk34
1.	Most commonly used in low birth weight infants (<1.5 kg).
2.	Can be considered in infants with intestinal disease with documented
intolerance to specialized infant formulas.
D. Safe Handling of Breast Milk35
1.	Freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored at room temperature
for up to 4 hours, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in the freezer for
approximately 6 months (up to 12 months), and in an insulated cooler
bag with frozen packs up to 24 hours while traveling.
2.	Once breast milk is thawed to room temperature or warmed, it should
be used within 2 hours.

aAcceptable osmolarity of parenteral nutrition through a peripheral line varies between 900 and 1050 osm/L by institu-

tion. An estimate of the osmolarity of parenteral nutrition can be obtained with the following formula: Estimated osmolarity = (dextrose concentration × 50) + (amino acid concentration × 100) + (mEq of electrolytes × 2). Consult individual
pharmacy for hospital limitations.
bIn general, infants require the higher concentration and/or rate of glucose, protein, and fat compared to older children
and adolescents
cEssential fatty acid deficiency may occur in fat-­free parenteral nutrition within 2 to 4 weeks in infants and children and
as early as 2 to 14 days in neonates. A minimum of 2% to 4% of total caloric intake as linoleic acid and 0.25% to 0.5%
as linolenic acid is necessary to meet essential fatty acid requirements.
dIf parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis occurs, lipid minimization and/or use of fish oil or composite lipids should
be considered.41

2.	Leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.
3.	Highest incidence in infants and children under 5 years old.
B. Clinical Presentation
1.	Early/generalized symptoms: Headache, lethargy/fatigue, nausea/
emesis, gait abnormalities; increased head circumference in infants
2.	Later symptoms related to tumor location: Seizures, altered language,
encephalopathy, hemiplegia/hemi-­sensory deficit, facial weakness, neuroendocrine effects (precocious/delayed puberty, diabetes insipidus),
visual changes, abnormal movements, back pain, sphincter disturbance

C. Initial Workup
1.	Thorough neurologic exam, including fundoscopic exam.
2.	Neurosurgery/Neuro-­oncology consultation.
3.	Labs: Presurgical tests (complete blood count [CBC], electrolytes, blood
type, coagulation factors, cross-­matching); endocrine tests for suprasellar tumors; α fetoprotein (AFP) and β human chorionic gonadotropin (β
hCG) if germinoma suspected.
4.	Imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain (sometimes spine)
with and without intravenous (IV) contrast.
D. Management Principles
1.	High-­dose dexamethasone: Often administered to reduce tumor-­
associated edema.
2.	Consider seizure prophylaxis for those at high risk of seizures or seizure
history.

V. ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES2,9-­16
A. Fever and Neutropenia (Fig 22.1)
1.	Etiology: Fever with temperature ≥38.3°C (some centers and medical
associations also use 38.0°C sustained over an hour to define fever)
in the setting of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500
cells/μL or <1000 cells/μL but expected to drop to <500 cells/μL in
the next 48 hours). Presumed serious infection in a neutropenic host.
While fevers may be caused by other etiologies including medications,
presume infection until proven otherwise.
2.	Presentation: May appear ill with fatigue, lethargy, or localized pain. Can
also appear well, yet have subtle signs of compensated shock, including
chills, rigors, tachypnea, or tachycardia. May deteriorate after initial
doses of antibiotics.
3.	Management: Broad-­spectrum antibiotics with antipseudomonal coverage should be administered within 60 minutes of presentation to medical facility. Note: Antibiotic administration may lead to clinical sepsis
secondary to release of endotoxin from gram-­negative bacteria.
B. Hyperleukocytosis/Leukostasis
1.	Etiology: Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (usually >100,000/μL)
in leukemia patients leads to leukostasis in the microcirculation and
diminished tissue perfusion (notably in CNS and lungs). Leukostasis
occurs more commonly and at lower WBC counts in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) than in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).
2.	Presentation: Hypoxia, tachypnea, dyspnea, and pulmonary
hemorrhage from pulmonary leukostasis. Mental status changes,
headaches, seizures, and papilledema from cerebral leukostasis.
May also see GI bleeding, abdominal pain, renal insufficiency,
priapism, and/or intracranial hemorrhage. Hyperleukocytosis may be
asymptomatic.

3.	Management
a.	Prompt initiation of chemotherapy is the most effective approach.
b.	Consider leukapheresis or exchange transfusion if evidence of symptomatic leukostasis.
c.	Transfuse platelets to keep count above 20,000/μL to prevent
hemorrhage.1
d.	Avoid red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which raise viscosity. If
required, consider partial exchange transfusion.
e.	Hydration and allopurinol should be initiated, as hyperleukocytosis
increases the risk of tumor lysis syndrome.
f.	Treat coagulopathy.
C. Tumor Lysis Syndrome
1.	Etiology: Rapid lysis of tumor cells releases intracellular contents into
the blood stream spontaneously before treatment or during early stages
of chemotherapy (especially Burkitt lymphoma, T-­cell leukemia/lymphoma, acute leukemias with hyperleukocytosis).
2.	Presentation: Hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia (with secondary hypocalcemia). Can lead to acute kidney injury. Symptoms include
nausea, anorexia, arrhythmias, seizures, and altered mental status.
3.	Diagnosis: CBC, basic metabolic panel (BMP), phosphorus, uric acid,
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), electrocardiogram (ECG).
4.	Prevention and Management
a.	Hydration: Dextrose-­containing IV fluids (without potassium, calcium,
phosphate) at twice maintenance rate. Keep urine-­specific gravity
<1.010 and urine output >100 mL/m2/hr. Alkalinization is no longer
recommended, given increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation.
b.	Hyperuricemia: Allopurinol inhibits formation of uric acid and should
only be given PO (see Formulary for dosing). Rasburicase converts
uric acid to the more soluble allantoin. Use in high-­risk patients,
especially those with uric acid >7.5 mg/dL. Do not use rasburicase with patients with known G6PD deficiency, as it may result in
methemoglobinemia.
c.	Monitor potassium, calcium, phosphorous, uric acid, and urinalysis
closely (up to Q2 hours for high-­risk patients). There is an increased
risk of calcium phosphate precipitation when Ca × Phos > 60.
Consider early use of sevelamer.
d.	See Chapter 11 for management of abnormal electrolytes and
Chapter 19 for dialysis indications.
D. Spinal Cord Compression
1.	Etiology: Intrinsic or extrinsic compression of spinal cord. Occurs most
commonly with metastases from brain tumors, spinal tumors, soft tissue
sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphoma.
2.	Presentation: Back pain (localized or radicular), weakness, sensory loss,
bowel or bladder dysfunction, gait abnormalities. Prognosis for recovery
based on duration and level of disability at presentation.

22

Chapter 22 Oncology  553

554  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
3.	Diagnosis: MRI (preferred) or computed tomography (CT) scan of spine.
Spine radiography is less sensitive.
4.	Management
a.	In the presence of neurologic abnormalities, strong history, and rapid
progression of symptoms, consider immediate dexamethasone. Note:
Steroids may prevent accurate diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma;
plan diagnostic procedure as soon as possible.
b.	If tumor type is known and chemosensitive, emergent chemotherapy
is indicated.
c.	If tumor type is unknown or debulking may remove most/all of tumor,
emergent neurosurgery consultation is indicated to decompress the
spine.
E. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
1.	Etiology: Ventricular obstruction or impaired cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
flow. Most commonly seen with brain tumors, but also with intracranial
hemorrhage, thrombosis, meningeal involvement by tumor or infection.
2.	Presentation: Headaches, altered mental status, irritability, lethargy,
nuchal rigidity, emesis, abnormal vision; Cushing triad and pupillary
changes are late and ominous findings.
3.	Diagnosis
a.	Evaluate for vital sign changes [i.e., Cushing triad (↓ heart rate, ↑
systolic blood pressure, irregular respirations)].
b.	Funduscopic evaluation for papilledema.
c.	Obtain CT or MRI of the head (MRI more sensitive for diagnosis of
posterior fossa tumors).
4.	Management
a.	See Chapter 1 for management principles.
b.	Obtain emergent neurosurgical consultation.
c.	If tumor is the cause, start IV dexamethasone (see Formulary for dosing).
F. Other Neurologic Emergencies: Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA),
Seizures
1.	CVA Etiology: Hyperleukocytosis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, radiation (fibrosis) or chemotherapy-­related (e.g., l-­asparaginase–induced
hemorrhage or thrombosis, methotrexate). Most common in patients
with AML or any form of leukemia with hyperleukocytosis.
2.	Seizure Etiology: Most common in primary CNS tumors, tumors metastatic to CNS, meningeal leukemia, chemotherapy-­related (intrathecal
[IT] cytarabine, IT/IV methotrexate).
3.	See Chapters 1 and 20 for diagnosis and management.
G. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/Superior Mediastinal Syndrome
1.	Etiology: Compression of venous drainage and trachea, most commonly
caused by mediastinal mass. Usually seen with T-­lymphoblastic lymphoma,
Hodgkin lymphoma, mature B-­cell lymphoma, and germ cell tumors.
2.	Presentation: Dyspnea, cough, wheeze, stridor, orthopnea, headaches,
facial swelling, dizziness, plethora.

3.	Diagnosis: Two-­view chest radiograph. If mediastinal mass present,
obtain neck radiograph to further assess. Avoid sedation if unstable,
high risk for airway obstruction.
4.	Management
a.	Control airway, place in upright position, and administer supplemental oxygen.
b.	Biopsy (e.g., bone marrow, pleurocentesis, lymph node biopsy)
before therapy if patient can tolerate sedation.
c.	Empiric therapy: Radiotherapy, steroids, chemotherapy. Note: can
confound diagnosis.
H. Typhlitis (Neutropenic Enterocolitis)
1.	Etiology: Inflammation of bowel wall, typically localized to cecum.
Associated with bacterial or fungal invasion. Associated with prolonged
neutropenia, often secondary to induction therapy in leukemia.
2.	Presentation: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea/emesis,
diarrhea, fever (may be absent early in course). Risk for perforation.
3.	Diagnosis
a.	Careful serial abdominal examinations.
b.	Abdominal ultrasound may be considered (may show pneumatosis
intestinalis, bowel wall edema). CT abdomen with IV and PO contrast
is most sensitive form of imaging.
4.	Management
a.	Bowel rest: NPO on IV fluids; consider nasogastric decompression.
b.	Broad anerobic and gram-­negative antibiotic coverage.
c.	Surgical consultation.
I. Cytokine Release Syndrome
1.	Etiology: Newer immunologic agents (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T
[CAR-­T] therapy and specific antibodies) can provoke release of cytokines
associated with systemic inflammation and hemodynamic instability.
2.	Presentation: Early symptoms include fever, diaphoresis, or mild
evidence of hemodynamic instability (tachycardia) that can progress
quickly to cardiovascular collapse and multi-­organ dysfunction.
3.	Diagnosis: Based on clinical features. Consider obtaining CRP and ferritin, although nondiagnostic.
4.	Management
a.	Tocilizumab: recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting
the IL-­6 receptor.
b.	Treat hypotension with IV fluids. If refractory, may require vasopressors, intensive care unit (ICU)-­level care.
c.	Closely monitor neurologic status because these agents are associated with neurotoxicity. Patient should be on seizure prophylaxis.

VII. COMMON CHEMOTHERAPY COMPLICATIONS AND SUPPORTIVE
CARE1,11
Note: Transfuse only irradiated and leukoreduced packed red blood cells
(pRBCs) and single-­donor platelets; cytomegalovirus (CMV)-­negative or
leukofiltered pRBCs/platelets for CMV-­negative patients. Use leukofiltered
pRBCs/platelets for those who may undergo transplant in the future to
prevent alloimmunization or for those who have had nonhemolytic febrile
transfusion reactions. Many oncology patients have nonhemolytic reactions
(fever, rash, hypotension, respiratory distress) to pRBCs and/or platelet
transfusion and should subsequently be premedicated with diphenhydramine and/or acetaminophen.
A. Cytopenias: Anemia, Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia
1.	Etiology: Chemotherapy, medication, radiation, marrow infiltration, blood
loss, hemolysis, consumptive coagulopathy.
2.	Management
a.	See Chapter 14 for details on transfusion.

b.	Anemia: Hemoglobin thresholds for pRBC transfusions in cancer
patients are based on clinical status and symptoms (often ≤8 g/dL).
c.	Thrombocytopenia: In general, maintain platelet count above
10,000/μL. Patients with active bleeding, fever, or before selected procedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, intramuscular injection) may require
higher thresholds. Consider maintaining at higher levels for patients
who have brain tumors, recent brain surgery, or history of stroke.
d.	Neutropenia:
(1)	Broad-­spectrum antibiotics with concomitant fever (see Fig. 22.1).
(2)	GCSF to assist in recovery of neutrophils.
B. Mucositis
1.	Etiology: Damage to endothelial cells of the GI tract from chemotherapy,
leading to breakdown of the mucosa. Typically peaks in the first 1 to 2
weeks after chemotherapy.
2.	Presentation: Oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, intolerance of PO intake.
3.	Prevention and Management: Supportive care aimed at pain control and
nutrition. Local pain control with lidocaine-­containing mouthwashes
and bicarbonate rinses. Systemic pain control often requires patient-­
controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is
commonly required.
C. Nausea and Emesis
1.	Etiology: Chemotherapy side effect. Also suspect opiate therapy, GI and
CNS radiotherapy, obstructive abdominal process, elevated ICP, certain
antibiotics, or hypercalcemia.
2.	Presentation: Can be acute (within 24 hours of chemotherapy initiation),
delayed (beyond 24 hours), or anticipatory in subsequent cycles.
3.	Therapy: Hydration plus one or more antiemetic medications (Table
22.5; see Formulary for dosing).

Note: Treatment length and dosage may vary per protocol.
IX. HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT)1,2,20
A. Goal
Administer healthy functioning hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood to a patient whose bone marrow is diseased (e.g., hematologic malignancy) or depleted (after treatment
with intense myeloablative chemotherapy). HSCT is also used for some congenital and acquired hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic disorders.
B. Preparative Regimens
1.	Myeloablative: Elimination of recipient’s diseased marrow with high-­dose
chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (TBI) prior

to stem cell infusion. Generally, provides greater anticancer activity but
carries a higher risk of treatment-­related organ injury.
2.	Nonmyeloablative: Reduced-­intensity conditioning regimen where marrow is not fully ablated, allowing recovery of autologous hematopoiesis
if patient fails to engraft. Associated with decreased treatment-­related
mortality but higher risk of relapse or transplant rejection.
C. Types of HSCT
1.	Allogeneic
a.	Recipient is transfused with donor stem cells from genetically similar
but nonidentical donor, following a preparative regimen that includes
chemotherapy and often radiation. Donors are screened for human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype matching to recipient. Possible
donors include HLA-­matched siblings, fully or partially HLA-­matched
unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and HLA-­haploidentical
(half-­matched) related donors.
b.	Increased level of mismatch between donor and recipient increases
the risk for graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD) but may offer greater
graft-­versus-­leukemia (GVL) immunologic treatment effect.
c.	Used commonly for leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and a number of nonmalignant
hematologic, immunologic, and metabolic disorders.
2. Autologous
a.	Donor is recipient. After several cycles of conventional chemotherapy, stem cells from patient are harvested from the patient, stored,
and given back after the patient has received intense myeloablative
doses of chemotherapy.
b.	Generally, lacks GVHD or GVL effect.
c.	Used for high-­risk neuroblastoma, lymphoma, and various high-­risk
solid tumors, which have demonstrated improved disease control
after higher intensity chemotherapy that would otherwise be limited
by excessive marrow suppression.
D. Engraftment
1.	Recipient’s bone marrow is repopulated with donor stem cells that
proliferate and mature.
2.	Usually starts within 2 to 4 weeks of transplant and may present with
an inflammatory response, but can be significantly delayed with certain
conditions, drug toxicity, or infection.
3.	Defined as an ANC more than 500/μl for 3 consecutive days.

X. COMPLICATIONS OF HSCT1,2,20-­22
A. Graft-­Versus-­Host Disease
1.	Etiology: Donor T-­cell-­mediated reaction to unique host antigens. Risk
factors include HLA disparity, source of stem cells (peripheral blood >
bone marrow > umbilical cord blood), magnitude of conditioning-­related
tissue injury, and posttransplant infections.

22

Chapter 22 Oncology  561

562  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
2.	Presentation: Acute GVHD most commonly occurs within 6 weeks of
transplantation, typically within 100 days of transplantation; rarely, it
may occur or persist beyond this time. Chronic GVHD traditionally presents >100 days after transplant but may occur earlier and persist.
a.	Maculopapular skin rash. Can progress to bullous lesions resembling
toxic epidermal necrolysis.
b.	GI symptoms: Anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
cramping, secretory diarrhea.
c.	Laboratory findings: Direct hyperbilirubinemia.
d.	Chronic GVHD can involve nearly any organ. Commonly includes
sclerodermatous skin changes, cholestasis/hepatitis, lung involvement (restrictive or obstructive), and/or dry eyes and mouth.
3.	Diagnosis: Triad of rash, abdominal cramping with diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia. Tissue biopsy of skin or mucosa can provide histologic
confirmation, demonstrating lymphocytic infiltration and apoptosis. See
Section XIII for clinical staging.
4.	Prevention and Management
a.	Prophylaxis: Immunosuppression with posttransplant cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and/or
sirolimus; adjuvants include methotrexate and prednisone.
b.	First-­line treatment: Grade 1 and 2 GVHD may be treated locally with
topical steroids (skin) or nonabsorbable enteral steroids (gut). First-­
line systemic treatment is corticosteroids, often with an additional
immunosuppressant.
c.	Note: Patients with cGVHD are functionally asplenic and significantly
immunosuppressed, requiring antimicrobial prophylaxis.
B. Sinusoidal Obstructive Syndrome (SOS); Veno-­Occlusive Disease
(VOD)
1.	Etiology: Injury to endothelial cells leads to activation of the clotting
cascade in liver sinusoids, causing erythrocyte congestion and occlusive fibrosis of terminal intrahepatic venules and sinusoids. Occurs
as a consequence of hematopoietic cell transplantation, hepatotoxic
chemotherapy, and/or high-­dose liver radiation. Typically occurs within
3 weeks of the insult, most common at the end of the first week after
transplant.
2.	Presentation: Tender hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, edema, ascites,
unexplained weight gain, thrombocytopenia refractory to transfusions.
3.	Diagnosis: There are two established clinical diagnostic criteria, the
Modified Seattle and Baltimore. Updated criteria based on growing
understanding of the pathophysiology have recently been proposed.26,30
As each has limitations, consideration of all factors enables earlier diagnosis, treatment, and improved outcomes.
a.	Modified Seattle Criteria: Two of the following events within 20 days of
HSCT: Bilirubin >2 mg/dL; tender hepatomegaly; weight gain >2%.
b.	Baltimore Criteria: Bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 21 days of HSCT plus
two of the following: Hepatomegaly; ascites; weight gain >5%.

c.	Proposed updated criteria, unpublished as of this writing, have an
expanded time frame with no time restriction to symptom development and broaden the definition by including transfusion refractory
thrombocytopenia and imaging/biopsy results as eligible criteria.
d.	Severe SOS is defined by the above, plus pulmonary and/or renal
organ failure.
e.	Imaging: Doppler US showing reversal of flow in the portal venous
system is often found with severe SOS (although its absence does
not rule out SOS).
4. Prevention and Treatment
a.	Prevention: Ursodeoxycholic acid from conditioning through 90 days
post transplant.
b.	Treatment: Mild/moderate SOS can be managed with supportive
care, including fluid and sodium restriction and diuretics. Defibrotide
is the only approved pharmacologic treatment modality, with
improved outcomes with earlier initiation and a 50% response rate.
Maintain coagulation factors, platelets, and RBCs in stable range
secondary to consumption.
c.	See Section XIII, for discussion of additional complications, including
engraftment syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, hemorrhagic
cystitis, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome.

XI. CANCER SURVIVORSHIP3,23-­25
A. Understand the Diagnosis
Obtain comprehensive treatment summary from oncologist summarizing
diagnosis, chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, surgeries, history of HSCT,
and adverse drug reactions.
B. Monitoring
1.	Determine any potential problems by organ system, and devise plan for
routine evaluation.

A. Complications of HSCT1,2,19-­21,25-­29
1.	Graft-­Versus-­Host Disease (GVHD)
See Table EC 22.A for grading of acute GVHD. Acute GVHD should be
graded weekly through day +100. If systemic treatment is started, it should
be graded twice weekly while on treatment.
2.	Engraftment Syndrome
a.	Etiology: Occurs several days prior to donor cell engraftment and in
days following white blood cell recovery owing to endothelial injury
and activated granulocytes in the setting of proinflammatory cytokines. Occurs in approximately 20% of HSCT patients.
b.	Presentation: Fever and rash; can have pulmonary infiltrates, diarrhea, or signs of shock.
c.	Diagnosis: Similar presentation to GVHD and infection. Imperative
to rule out infection while treating empirically with antibiotics. Often
mild and self-­limited. However, if symptoms continue for ≥ 48 hours
or are severe, consider initiation of corticosteroids. If insufficient steroid response after 72 hours, can biopsy for alternative diagnoses.
d.	Treatment: Treatment with supportive care and corticosteroids; optimization of GVHD prophylaxis. If biopsy confirms immune-­mediated
pathology, can treat with additional immunosuppressive agents.
3.	Transplant-­Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TA-TMA)
a.	Etiology: Associated with immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine,
tacrolimus) and infection.
b.	Presentation: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumptive
thrombocytopenia. Often associated with renal insufficiency/failure;
may be associated with neurologic symptoms.
c.	
Diagnosis: Anemia and thrombocytopenia on CBC, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, hematuria, proteinuria, casts on urinalysis, elevated
LDH, decreased haptoglobin, impaired renal function, elevated d-­dimer on
coagulation panel.
d.	Treatment: Supportive care with blood products, fluid management, and
dialysis. Address underlying etiology—consider alternative immunosuppressant and treat any underlying infection. For progressive or severe
TA-TMA, consider neutralization of compliment with eculizumab.31
4.	Hemorrhagic Cystitis
a.	Etiology: Pretransplant conditioning regimens (specifically those that
include cyclophosphamide, pelvic or total body irradiation [TBI]) or
viral reactivation (adenovirus, BK virus).
b.	Presentation: Hematuria, dysuria, difficulty voiding due to clots.
c.	Diagnosis: Urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for adenovirus and BK virus, bacterial cultures, bladder ultrasound, CBC,
coagulation studies.
d.	Treatment: Hydration, analgesics, platelet transfusion, treatment of
any underlying infections. For obstruction, Foley catheter with bladder irrigation.
565.e1

565.e2  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
5.	Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome
a.	Etiology: Widespread alveolar injury in the absence of infection or other
known etiology. Thought to occur from a variety of insults, including toxic
effects of the conditioning regimen, immunologic cell–mediated injury,
and inflammation secondary to cytokine release following engraftment.
Most commonly occurs within the first 120 days after transplant.
b.	Presentation: Rapidly progressive dry cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia,
diffuse radiographic opacities; may progress to ARDS.
c.	Diagnosis: Imaging; bronchoalveolar lavage with transbronchial
biopsy, if tolerated.
d.	Prevention and Management: Supportive care together with broad-­
spectrum antibiotics while infectious studies pending. IV corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor-­α inhibitor etanercept if no infection
identified.32

Palliative Care
Joshua Natbony, MD
I. INTRODUCTION TO HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
A. Definition of Palliative Care1,2
1.	Palliative care is the active total care of the child’s body, mind, and spirit
with the intent to prevent and relieve suffering, with a special focus on
symptom control.
2.	Palliative medicine supports the best quality of life for the child and
family. It can be provided along with disease-­directed treatment from
the time of diagnosis of serious illness.
3.	See Fig. 23.1 for the current accepted model of palliative care.
B. Definition of Hospice
1.	Hospice care is an insurance benefit that may be initiated for patients
who have a terminal illness with a life expectancy estimated to be 6
months or less.
2.	It specializes in care at the end of life to promote a child’s comfort and
to support loved ones in their bereavement.
C. Team Composition
1.	Hospice and palliative care teams are often robust and
interdisciplinary.
2.	They generally include physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, child life specialists, pastoral care,
patient care coordinators, and bereavement coordinators.

II. COMMUNICATION AND DECISION MAKING
A. Decision-­Making Tools3
1.	Provide framework for discussion with families regarding medical
issues, quality of life, family goals, preferences, and other contextual
preferences, such as spirituality and culture.
2.	Advance directives:
a.	Adolescents aged 18 years and older, if they are unable to speak
for themselves, can name another adult to make healthcare
decisions.
b.	Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age can actively
participate in decision making by using helpful tools such as “Five
Wishes” and “Voicing My Choices” (see in Section IV).
B. Structuring Family Meetings4
1.	Make sure that all necessary individuals are present and understand
the purpose of the meeting.
2.	Make sure that all clinicians are in agreement about the patient’s
condition and the recommendations.
3.	Identify the individual who will facilitate the meeting.
4.	Choose a private location with minimal distraction.
5.	Always have water and tissues available.
6.	Begin by introducing all participants and the purpose of the meeting.
7.	Assess what the family knows and expects with respect to the patient’s
condition.
8.	Describe the clinical situation, providing the big picture and then asking family members if they would like or are ready for more details.
9.	Encourage each member of the family to express concerns and
questions.
10.	Explore the patient’s and family’s values and how they influence decision making.
11.	Propose goals for the patient’s care that reflect the stated values.
12.	Provide a concrete follow-­up plan.
C. Breaking Bad News5
1.	Prepare yourself: Know the medical information, know what you will say,
ask the patient/family if they want someone in particular present with
them for the discussion.
2.	Prepare the family/patient: Give a brief, calm statement that leads into
the news.
3.	State the news: Do this clearly and concisely, and be as definitive as
possible.
4.	Wait for the patient/family’s reaction: Resist the urge to say more; allow
others to speak first.
5.	Reflect the response back: “This news is clearly very upsetting to you.”
6.	Legitimize the reaction: “It is understandable that you would be upset.”
7.	Explore: “What upsets you the most about this news?”
8.	Provide realistic hope.

568  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
9.	Discuss next steps (if appropriate at this time): “May I address your
concerns now and talk about the next steps for treatment, or would you
like more time?”
D. Other Tools for Difficult Conversations
1.	Assess spirituality according to the “FICA” tool6:
a.	Faith and belief: “Do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?”
b.	Importance in life: “What importance does your faith or belief system
have in your life?”
c.	Community: “Are you a part of a spiritual or religious community?”
d.	Address in care: “How would you like me, your healthcare provider,
to address these issues in your healthcare?”
2.	“Ask-­tell-­ask”7
a.	Ask the patient or family to describe their understanding of the situation or issue.
b.	Tell them what you need to communicate in a straightforward manner.
c.	Ask them questions to assess their understanding.
3.	“Hope together” with the patient and family while also preparing for all
possible outcomes.

III. CARE OF THE DYING CHILD
A. Limiting Interventions
The following options should be considered.
1.	Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR)—foregoing cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) and other resuscitative interventions as part of an
overall care plan that emphasizes comfort and quality of living.
2.	Do not intubate (DNI)—although, if clinically appropriate, intubation
may still allow the initiation of continuous positive-­pressure ventilation or
may help in managing symptoms.
3.	Do not escalate treatment—the choice to forego changes in treatment,
even as a patient’s condition worsens, because death is expected.
Examples of such requests include the following:
a.	Do not increase the dose of current medications
(e.g., vasopressors).
b.	Do not add new medications (e.g., antibiotics).
c.	Do not initiate new interventions (e.g., dialysis, mechanical
ventilation).
d.	However, one may still initiate and increase interventions to treat pain
and reduce suffering.
4.	Discontinuing current interventions—the option of discontinuing interventions that prolong the dying process must also be discussed.
5.	Medical orders for life-­sustaining treatment and physician orders for
life-­sustaining treatment (POLST) forms:
a.	These are portable and enduring medical order forms completed
by patients or their authorized decision makers and are signed by a
physician.

b.	They contain orders regarding CPR and other life-­sustaining
treatments.
c.	If a state offers one of these forms, the orders are valid for emergency medical service providers as well as healthcare providers and
facilities within that state.
d.	A copy must be provided to the patient or authorized decision
maker within 48 hours of completion or sooner if the patient is to be
transferred.
e.	Refer to your state’s laws prior to completing any documentation.
f.	Additional information for US providers can be found at www.polst.
org.
B. Involving the Child in Conversations About Death8-­11
1.	See Table 23.1 for the development of death concepts in children.12
2.	A minor child has the capacity to meaningfully participate in medical
decision making if he or she demonstrates the ability to do all of the
following:
a.	Communicate understanding of the medical information.
b.	State his or her preference.
c.	Communicate understanding of the consequences of decisions.
3.	Helpful documents are available for purchase from the nonprofit Aging
with Dignity (see Section IV.B).
a.	Five Wishes: This is a legal advance directive with versions tailored
for adolescents.
b.	Voicing My Choices: A workbook for adolescents intended to complement Five Wishes.
c.	My Wishes: A simple booklet for younger children to help them share
their preferences.

DOSING FOR MEDICATIONS USED IN PALLIATIVE CARE12,16-­20

572  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
E. Explaining Autopsies15
1.	Definitions
a.	An autopsy is a definitive examination of a deceased patient to determine the cause of death.
b.	A forensic autopsy is a legally mandated examination to determine
cause of death in a criminal investigation.
c.	A rapid autopsy involves the urgent removal of tissues for research
uses.
2.	Frequently asked questions
a.	A voluntary autopsy can look at all parts of a patient’s body or only
some.
b.	An autopsy will not affect the patient’s body cosmetically and should
not affect funeral or viewing arrangements.
c.	An autopsy takes 2 to 4 hours to perform and should not delay
funeral/burial arrangements.
3.	Benefits of autopsy
a.	For families:
(1)	Provides closure regarding diagnosis.
(2)	Identifies possible genetic etiologies for unexplained death.
b.	For providers: clarifies potential diagnostic errors and uncertainties.
F. Organ Donation
a.	Most hospitals have a special third-­party team that coordinates organ
donations.
b.	Inform family members, if they are interested, that this team may be
visiting soon to explain the process.
G. Completing Death Certificates14
1.	Locate a copy of a sample death certificate for reference.
2.	Cardiopulmonary arrest or respiratory arrest is NOT an acceptable
primary cause of death.
3.	For specific instructions for your state and/or institution, contact the
Office of Decedent Affairs at your institution.
4.	If you are completing a handwritten death certificate:
a.	Use BLACK INK ONLY and complete Physician sections.
b.	DO NOT use abbreviations (e.g., spell out the month: January 31,
not 1/31).
c.	DO NOT cross out or use correction fluid; you must begin again if
mistakes are made.
H. Interacting with Loved Ones After a Child’s Death
1.	It is appropriate to send condolence cards, contact families, or attend
funerals after a child has died. These are all appropriate physician
activities that are deeply valued by bereaved families. Families want to
know that their children are not forgotten.
2.	Numerous services are available for families, including: pastoral care,
social work, bereavement coordinators, community support groups,
counseling services, and bereavement follow-­up programs.

Christopher Morrow, MD
I. OVERVIEW
A. Epidemiology and General Approach
1.	Prevalence: 15% to 20% of children in primary care practices require
psychiatric care.1
2.	Surveillance and Screening:
a.	Surveillance for mental health issues should occur at all routine well-­
child visits from early childhood through adolescence.
b.	The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is a general mental health
checklist that screens for a broad array of disorders (Table 24.1).
3.	See the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-­5), for full list of psychiatric diagnoses.2
4.	Pharmacotherapy for many disorders may be managed or monitored by
the pediatrician. See Riddle et al., “Pediatric Psychopharmacology for
Primary Care.”3
B. Mental Status Exam
1.	General appearance: dress, self-­care, demeanor, attitude, behavior
2.	Motor activity: activity level (restless, fidgety, stereotyped or ritualized
movements)
3.	Speech and language: fluency, comprehension, rate, rhythm, volume,
expressive and receptive skills
4.	Mood and affect: stated and observed
5.	Thought form/content
a.	What patient is thinking about
b.	Goal-­directed nature of thoughts, coherence, organization, delusional
content
6.	Abnormal perceptual phenomena: illusions, hallucinations
7.	Insight, judgment, cognition

II. POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
A. Epidemiology4:
Prevalence in most studies is between 10% and 15%
B. Screening:
1.	Universal screening is recommended for all postpartum women.
2.	A history of depression doubles the risk of postpartum depression and
should prompt careful assessment for postpartum symptoms.5

TABLE 24.1
MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TESTS BY DIAGNOSIS

576  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
C. Diagnosis:
1.	Depression occurring in the 12-­month period after birth.
2.	Maternal depression is important to identify and treat, given the substantial impact on the health of the developing infant. Impaired maternal
attachment may compromise the social, cognitive, and behavioral development of the infant.4
3.	The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a 10-­item questionnaire
which can be completed in 5 minutes or less.6
D. Treatment:
1.	Referral to mother’s primary care physician or mental health expert is
preferred.
2.	Integrating maternal mental health into pediatrics practice is ideal.6
III. COMMON PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS IN CHILDREN (2 TO 12
YEARS)
A. Attention-­Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
1.	Epidemiology:
a.	Persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-­impulsivity that
interferes with functioning or development.
b.	Prevalence continues to rise. This disorder affected 11.0% (6.4 million) of children in the United States in 2011, marking an increase
from 9.5% (5.4 million) of children in 2007.7,8
c.	Most affected children continue to meet the diagnostic criteria for attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) through
adolescence.
2.	Screening: Evaluate all children aged 4 to 18 years who have academic and/or behavioral concerns for ADHD and common comorbid
conditions (depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct
disorder).9
3.	Diagnosis2:
a.	DSM-­5 diagnostic criteria: inattention, impulsivity/hyperactivity that
are more frequent and severe than typically observed in children of
the same developmental age.
b.	Symptoms must persist for 6 months or more, occur before the age
of 12 years, and should be evident in two or more settings (e.g.,
home and school). 2,10
c.	Subtypes: Combined, predominantly inattentive, or predominantly
hyperactive/impulsive.
d.	Diagnosis is made using history, observation, and behavioral checklists such as the Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (see Table 24.1).
e.	If the medical history is unremarkable, no further laboratory or
neurologic testing is required. Psychological and neuropsychological testing is not required for diagnosis but is recommended if other
academic or developmental concerns are present.10

4.	Treatment:
a.	Pharmacologic treatment works best with behavioral therapy as an
adjunct.9
b.	Behavioral therapy may be tried alone in preschool-­age children (4
to 5 years old), but for older children or in preschool-­age children
where behavioral therapy is ineffective, combination therapy with
pharmacologic and behavioral interventions is most effective.11
c.	Before starting a stimulant medication, a history should be taken
to exclude cardiac symptoms, Wolff-­Parkinson-­White syndrome, a
family history of sudden death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and
long-­QT syndrome. Screening electrocardiography is not required if
there is no personal or family history of cardiac disease.12
d.	See Table 24.2 for recommended pharmacologic treatments. The
ADHD Medication Guide provides visual information (see Section VI).
(1)	For preschool-­age children (4 to 5 years old), start with behavioral therapy and, if necessary, a methylphenidate stimulant.3,11
(2)	For elementary-­age children (6 or more years old), start with behavioral and stimulant therapy (methylphenidate or amphetamine).3,11
e.	Titrate medications to maximal symptom control with minimal side
effects.
f.	Common side effects of stimulants to monitor include appetite
suppression, abdominal pain, headaches, palpitations, and sleep
disturbance.9
g.	If the first stimulant is ineffective, consider an alternative class of
stimulant. Second-­line options as alternative therapy or as an augmenting agent to stimulant therapy include guanfacine, clonidine,
and atomoxetine.3,11
h.	If multiple medication trials prove ineffective, consultation with a
pediatric psychiatrist is suggested.
B. Anxiety Disorders
1.	Epidemiology:
a.	A group of disorders characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and
related behavioral disturbances.
b.	An estimated 4.7% of all children 3 to 17 years of age are affected,
with onset most often before the age of 25 and increased prevalence
(15% to 20%) among adolescents 13 to 17 years of age.13-­15
2.	Clinical Presentation:
a.	May present with fear or worry and without recognizing that their fear
or anxiety is unreasonable.
b.	Commonly have somatic complaints of headache and abdominal
pain. Patients with many primary care visits for such complaints may
benefit from formal anxiety screening.
c.	Fear/anxiety may affect school performance or manifest as school
avoidance.
d.	Crying, irritability, angry outbursts, and disruptive behavior are
expressions of fear and an effort to avoid anxiety-­provoking stimuli.

IV. COMMON PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS IN ADOLESCENTS
A. Depressive Disorders
1.	Epidemiology:
a.	A group of disorders characterized by mood changes as well as
somatic and cognitive symptoms that disrupt functioning.
b.	Prevalence of major depressive disorder: 2% of children, 4% to 8%
of adolescents.15

b.	Multiple screening tools are available (see Table 24.1). The Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-­2) is a brief but effective tool for use in
adolescents.19
c.	All patients with suspected depressive symptoms should be screened
for suicidal ideation and referred for emergency evaluation if serious
thoughts and/or action plans are endorsed (see Section V.A).
3.	Diagnosis:
a.	DSM-­5 Major Depressive Disorder diagnostic criteria:
(1)	Five or more of the following symptoms for 2 or more weeks:
Must include either depressed mood/irritability OR anhedonia;
changes in appetite/weight, sleep, or activity; fatigue or loss of

24

Chapter 24 Psychiatry  579

580  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
(3)	Symptoms not due to substance use or a medical condition.
(4)	No history of manic episodes.20
b.	Other depressive disorders are defined by their own diagnostic criteria2: (1) disruptive mood dysregulation disorder; (2) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia); (3) premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
c.	Differential diagnosis: bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder.
4.	Treatment:
a.	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be initiated in
the primary care setting. Referral to subspecialist may be required
depending on severity or in the case of treatment failure (Fig. 24.1).
b.	Antidepressant medications (see Table 24.2) and CBT combined are
the most effective treatments, followed by medication alone and then
CBT alone.21

c.	SSRIs have a black box warning from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) concerning a possible increase in suicidal
thoughts or behaviors after initiation of medication.
(1)	The basis of this warning was a large meta-­analysis that found no
increase in completed suicides but a small increase in suicidal
ideation.22
(2)	Multiple professional mental health groups support the continued
use of SSRIs in treating depression in children and adolescents
because the benefits appear to outweigh potential risks.20,23,24
d.	Refer to the Physicians Med Guide prepared by the American
Psychological Association (APA) and American Academy of Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) for guidelines regarding medication use for depression in adolescents (see Section VI).25
B. Substance Use Disorders
1.	Epidemiology:
a.	Lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse: 0.4% to 9%; alcohol dependence: 0.6% to 4.3%.26
b.	Lifetime diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence: 3.3% to 9.8%.26
c.	Common comorbid conditions: disruptive behavior disorders, mood
disorders, anxiety disorders.
2.	Clinical Presentation:
a.	Acute change in mood, behavior, and cognition.
(1)	Mood: low to elevated mood
(2)	Behavior: disinhibition, lethargy, hyperactivity, agitation, somnolence, hypervigilance

c.	Evaluate age of onset of use; progression of use for specific substances;
circumstances, frequency, and variability of use; types of agents used.
d.	Consider urine/serum toxicology evaluation if there is concern for
substance use and patient consents to testing.
4.	Treatment:
a.	Determine goals and readiness for change; promote behavioral
change through motivational interviewing.27
b.	Families should be involved in treatment.
c.	Medications can be used to manage withdrawal symptoms and/or
cravings.

(self-­induced vomiting)
(3)	Self-­evaluation excessively influenced by body shape or
weight5
3.	Treatment:
a.	Aimed at nutritional rehabilitation and therapy (family-­based or as
a component of day treatment programs). Hospitalization may be
needed in cases of medical instability. See Chapter 21 for management of refeeding syndrome.
b.	SSRIs indicated in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (see Table 24.2).
No medications have been approved for use in anorexia nervosa.28

B. Agitation31,32
1.	Definition:
a.	Agitation can be defined as disruptive behavior occurring during
periods of emotional distress.
b.	Manifestations include
(1)	Excessive motor activity: pacing, fidgeting
(2)	Verbal aggression: yelling, shouting, rapid uninterruptable
speech, threats
(3)	Physical aggression: hitting, throwing things
c.	Agitation frequently occurs as a manifestation of psychiatric illness,
but it can also present in behaviorally disordered youth or as a result
of organic neurologic disease.
d.	Agitation is a multifactorial symptom. Risk factors for agitation
include history of aggression, history of physical abuse, past psychiatric hospitalizations, traumatic brain injury, autism spectrum
disorder, delirium, and substance use.
2.	Management (Fig. 24.3):
Determine the etiology of agitation:
a.	Review vital signs, presenting history, past diagnoses, past episodes
of agitation.
b.	Attempt to rule out underlying medical cause (e.g., ingestion, traumatic brain injury).
3.	Treatment
a.	Nonpharmacologic
(1)	Low-­stimulation environment (e.g., dim lights, move child away
from busy areas, avoid unnecessary interventions).
(2)	Communicate in a calm, neutral, empathetic tone at eye level
using simple language.
(3)	Utilize distraction techniques and Child Life services if available.
b.	Pharmacologic: therapy choice should target the etiology of agitation
(see Fig. 24.3).
c.	Restraints and seclusion: reserved for cases where both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions fail. Regulations and
requirements for use vary by state.
(1)	Close monitoring required.
(2)	Frequent reassessment of necessity of restraints.

1.	Noninvasive and indirect measurement of arterial O2 saturation (SaO2)
estimated by light absorption characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in peripheral blood.
2.	Limitations:
a.	Measures oxygen saturation, not O2 delivery to tissues.
b.	Insensitive to hyperoxia. See Fig. EC 25.A for oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.
c.	Artificially increased by carboxyhemoglobin levels >1% to 2%.
d.	Artificially decreased by intravenous dyes, opaque nail polish, and
methemoglobin levels >1%.
e.	Unreliable when pulse signal is poor due to hypothermia, hypovolemia, shock, edema, and movement artifact.
B. Capnography4,5
1.	Measures CO2 concentration of expired gas by infrared or mass
spectroscopy.
2.	End-­tidal CO2 (ETCO2) correlates with PaCO2 (usually within 5 mmHg in
healthy subjects).
3.	Used to evaluate proper placement of an endotracheal tube, to monitor
ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients, to assess effectiveness of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and during polysomnography.
C. Blood Gases6-­8
1.	Arterial blood gas (ABG): Most accurate way to assess oxygenation
(PaO2), ventilation (PaCO2), and acid-­base status (pH and HCO3−). See
Chapter 28 for normal mean values.
2.	Venous blood gas (VBG): PvCO2 averages 6 to 8 mmHg higher than
PaCO2; venous pH is slightly lower than arterial pH.
3.	Capillary blood gas (CBG): Correlation with ABG is generally best for pH,
moderate for PCO2, and worst for PO2.
D. Analysis of Acid-­Base Disturbances9-­11
The first step is to determine the primary disturbance (metabolic versus
respiratory); the second step is to assess for a mixed disorder by calculating expected compensatory response. See Chapter 11 for details.

PEFR, Peak expiratory flow rate
Data from Voter KZ. Diagnostic tests of lung function. Pediatr Rev. 1996;17:53–63.

II. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (PFT)
Provide objective and reproducible measurements of airway function and
lung volumes. Used to characterize disease, assess severity, and follow
response to therapy.
A. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)12,13
Maximal flow rate generated during a forced expiratory maneuver.
1.	Used to follow the course of asthma and response to therapy by comparing current PEFR with the previous “personal best” and the normal
predicted value.
2.	Limitations: Normal values vary across racial groups, measurement is
effort dependent, cannot be used reliably in many young children.
3.	Normal predicted PEFR values for children are shown in Table 25.1.
B. Maximal Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressures14,15
Maximal pressure generated during inhalation and exhalation against a
fixed obstruction. Used as a measure of respiratory muscle strength.
1.	Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is in the range of 80 to 120
cm H2O at all ages. A low MIP may be an indication for ventilatory
support.
2.	Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) increases with age and is greater
in males. A low MEP correlates with decreased effectiveness of
coughing.
C. Spirometry (for Children 6 Years of Age or Above)16,17
Plot of airflow versus time during rapid, forceful, complete expiration from
total lung capacity (TLC) to residual volume (RV) is useful to characterize different patterns of airway obstruction (Fig. 25.1). Usually performed
before and after bronchodilation to assess response to therapy or after
bronchial challenge to assess airway hyperreactivity.

morning. The inflammation causes increased airway hyperreactivity to a
variety of stimuli: viral infections, cold air, exercise, emotions, environmental allergens, and pollutants.
B. Clinical Presentation
1.	Cough, increased work of breathing (tachypnea, retractions, accessory
muscle use), wheezing, hypoxia, and hypoventilation. Crackles may also
be present with asthma exacerbations.
2.	No audible wheezing may indicate very poor air movement and severe
bronchospasm.
3.	Radiographic findings: peribronchial thickening, hyperinflation, patchy
atelectasis.
C. Treatment
1.	See Chapter 1 for acute management of status asthmaticus.
2.	Initial classification and initiation of treatment for ages 0 to 4, 5 to 11,
and 12 years and above (Figs. 25.3–25.5).
3.	Stepwise approach to continued management for ages 0 to 4, 5 to 11,
and 12 years and above (Figs. 25.6–25.8)
4.	Additional management guidelines available from the Global Initiative for
Asthma.21
D. Prevention of Exacerbations
1.	Ensure up-­to-­date immunizations, including influenza.
2.	Create an asthma action plan.
3.	Identify and minimize asthma triggers and environmental exposures.
4.	Assess symptom control, inhaler technique, and medication adherence
with regular clinical evaluations.
5.	Consider specialist referral for formal PFTs, monitoring, and allergy testing.
6.	See Table EC 25.A for dosing guidelines for inhaled corticosteroids.

IV. BRONCHIOLITIS19-­23
A. Definition
1.	Lower respiratory tract infection common in infants and children aged 2
years and younger.
2.	Characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of
airway epithelium, leading to increased mucus production and
bronchospasm.
3.	Most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but can
also be seen with other viruses including parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, mycoplasma, and human metapneumovirus.
B. Clinical Presentation
1.	Rhinitis and cough, which may progress to tachypnea, wheezing, rales,
use of accessory muscles, and/or nasal flaring. Transient apnea may
also be seen.
2.	Radiographic findings: hyperinflation and atelectasis.
3.	Radiographs and viral testing should NOT be routinely obtained.

Consider severity and interval since
last exacerbation. Frequency and severity
may fluctuate over time.
Exacerbations of any severity may occur in patients
in any severity category.
Step 3 and consider
short course of oral
systemic corticosteroids
In 2–6 weeks, depending on severity, evaluate level of
asthma control that is achieved. If no clear benefit is
observed in 4–6 weeks, consider adjusting therapy
or alternative diagnoses.

Step 1

Step 2

Key: EIB, exercise-induced bronchospasm
Notes
• The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required to
meet individual patient needs.
• Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk. Assess impairment domain by
patient’s/caregiver’s recall of previous 2–4 weeks. Symptom assessment for longer periods
should reflect a global assessment such as inquiring whether the patient’s asthma is better or
worse since the last visit. Assign severity to the most severe category in which any feature
occurs.
• At present, there are inadequate data to correspond frequencies of exacerbations with
different levels of asthma severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had ≥2 exacerbations
requiring oral systemic corticosteroids in the past 6 months, or ≥4 wheezing episodes in the
past year, and who have risk factors for persistent asthma may be considered the same as
patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent
with persistent asthma.

• With viral respiratory infection: SABA Q4–6 hr up to 24 hr (longer
with physician consult). Consider short course of oral systemic
corticosteroids if exacerbation is severe or patient has history of previous
severe exacerbations.
• Caution: Frequent use of SABA may indicate the need to step up
treatment. See text for recommendations on initiating daily long-termcontrol therapy.
Key: Alphabetical order is used when more than one treatment option is listed within

• If clear benefit is not observed within 4–6 weeks and patient/family medication technique and
adherence are satisfactory, consider adjusting therapy or alternative diagnosis.
• Studies on children 0–4 years of age are limited. Step 2 preferred therapy is based on
Evidence A. All other recommendations are based on expert opinion and extrapolation from
studies in older children.

Quick-relief medication for all patients
• SABA as needed for symptoms. Intensity of treatment depends on severity
of symptoms: up to 3 treatments at 20-min intervals as needed. Short
course of oral systemic corticosteroids may be needed.
• Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use >2 days a week for symptom relief
(not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and the need
to step up treatment.
Key: Alphabetical order is used when more than one treatment option is listed within
either preferred or alternative therapy. ICS, inhaled corticosteroid; LABA, long-acting inhaled
b2-agonist; LTRA, leukotriene receptor antagonist; PRN, as needed; SABA, short-acting inhaled
b2-agonist
Notes:
• The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required
to meet individual patient needs.
• If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the
preferred treatment before stepping up.
• Theophylline is a less desirable alternative due to the need to monitor serum concentration
levels.
• Step 1 and step 2 medications are based on Evidence A. Step 3 ICS + adjunctive therapy
and ICS are based on Evidence B for efficacy of each treatment and extrapolation from
comparator trials in older children and adults—comparator trials are not available for this
age group; steps 4–6 are based on expert opinion and extrapolation from studies in older
children and adults.
• Immunotherapy for steps 2–4 is based on Evidence B for house dust mites, animal danders,
and pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest
for immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children
than in adults. Clinicians who administer immunotherapy should be prepared and equipped
to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.

Key: Alphabetical order is used when more than one treatment option is listed within either
preferred or alternative therapy. EIB, exercise-induced bronchospasm; ICS, inhaled corticosteroid;
LABA, long-acting inhaled β2-agonist; LTRA, leukotriene receptor antagonist; PRN, as needed;
SABA, short-acting inhaled β2-agonist
Notes:
• The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision making required to meet
individual patient needs.
• If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the preferred
treatment before stepping up.
• Zileuton is a less-desirable alternative as adjunctive therapy due to limited studies and the need to
monitor liver function. Theophylline requires monitoring of serum concentration levels.
• In step 6, before oral systemic corticosteroids are introduced, a trial of high-dose ICS + LABA + either
LTRA, theophylline, or zileuton may be considered, although this approach has not been studied in
clinical trials.
• Step 1, 2, and 3 preferred therapies are based on Evidence A; step 3 alternative therapy is based on
Evidence A for LTRA, Evidence B for theophylline, and Evidence D for zileuton. Step 4 preferred therapy
is based on Evidence B, and alternative therapy is based on Evidence B for LTRA and theophylline and
Evidence D for zileuton. Step 5 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B. Step 6 preferred therapy is
based on Expert Panel Report 2 (1997) and Evidence B for omalizumab.
• Immunotherapy for steps 2–4 is based on Evidence B for house dust mites, animal danders, and
pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest for
immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children than in adults.
• Clinicians who administer immunotherapy or omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify
and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.

ESTIMATED COMPARATIVE DAILY DOSAGES FOR INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS—cont’d

Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine   597

C. Treatment
Mainstay is supportive care.
1.	Assess risk factors for severe disease, such as age less than 12 weeks,
a history of prematurity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or
immunodeficiency.
2.	Clinicians should NOT administer albuterol, epinephrine, systemic
corticosteroids, or chest physiotherapy to previously healthy infants and
children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Antibiotics should be administered only for concomitant bacterial infection.
3.	Nebulized hypertonic saline may be administered to hospitalized infants
and children, although evidence of effectiveness is mixed.20-­22
4.	Evidence supporting continuous pulse oximetry and supplemental O2
when SpO2 is greater than 90% is currently lacking.
5.	Nasogastric or intravenous fluid is necessary when infant is unable to
maintain oral hydration.
6.	High-­flow nasal cannula supports breathing in infants requiring supplemental oxygen and may decrease the rate of escalation of care.23
7.	RSV immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab for high-­risk infants (see
Chapter 16).

V. BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA (BPD)24-­27
A. Definition
1.	Also known as chronic lung disease of prematurity or chronic lung
disease of infancy.
2.	Chronic pulmonary condition that usually evolves after premature birth,
characterized by a need for oxygen supplementation >21% for at least
28 days after birth.
3.	Thought to be a result of airway inflammation, damage from hyperoxia,
hypoxia, or mechanical ventilation; results in interference with normal
lung alveolar, airway, and vascular development.
4.	Earlier gestational age in preterm infants is associated with a higher
likelihood of BPD development.
B. Clinical Presentation
Children with BPD may have persistent respiratory symptoms, airway
hyperreactivity, and supplemental oxygen requirements, especially during
intercurrent illness.
C. Diagnosis
Severity based on oxygen requirement at time of assessment and characterized as mild if on room air, moderate if requiring <30% oxygen or severe
if requiring >30% oxygen and/or positive pressure.
1.	If gestational age at birth was <32 weeks, assess infant at 36
weeks’ postmenstrual age or at discharge to home, whichever
comes first.
2.	If gestational age at birth >32 weeks, assess infant at 28 to 56 days
postnatal age or at discharge to home, whichever comes first.

25

Chapter 25

598  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
D. Treatment
1.	Children with BPD often require some combination of the following for
their lung disease:
a.	Bronchodilators
b.	Antiinflammatory agents (corticosteroids)
c.	Supplemental oxygen therapy
d.	Diuretics
e.	Tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe cases
f.	RSV prophylaxis if indicated (see Chapter 16)
2.	Children with BPD need close monitoring for complications, which can
affect additional organ systems and processes, including pulmonary
or systemic hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, nephrocalcinosis
(from chronic diuretics), neurodevelopmental or growth delay, aspiration
from dysphagia and/or gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and more severe
infections with RSV or influenza.

VI. CYSTIC FIBROSIS28-­37
A. Definition
Autosomal recessive disorder in which mutations of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene reduce the function
of a chloride channel that usually resides on the surface of epithelial cells
in the airways, pancreatic ducts, biliary tree, intestine, vas deferens, and
sweat glands, resulting in progressive obstructive pulmonary disease and
pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.
B. Clinical Manifestations (Fig. 25.9)
C. Diagnosis
Diagnosing CF is a multistep process (Fig. 25.10); a complete evaluation
involves the following:
1.	Newborn screening (NBS): utilizes blood immunoreactive trypsinogen
(IRT) level and/or CFTR gene mutation analysis.
2.	Quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis (sweat chloride) test: gold
standard for diagnosis. False-­positive results can be seen in untreated
adrenal insufficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1, fucosidosis,
hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, ectodermal dysplasia,
malnutrition, mucopolysaccharidosis, and panhypopituitarism.
3.	Genetic analysis: over 2000 CFTR mutations have been described; the
most common is F508del.
D. Treatment
Patients with CF should be managed within a CF Foundation accredited
care center.
1.	Pulmonary
a.	Airway clearance therapy to mobilize airway secretions and facilitate
expectoration. Often manual/mechanical percussion and postural
drainage is used. Older children may use high-­frequency vest
therapy, mechanical chest percussors, or oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (PEP) handheld devices.

VII. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME (OSAS)38-­42
A. Definition
Disorder of breathing during sleep characterized by prolonged partial upper
airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction that disrupts
normal ventilation during sleep and normal sleep patterns.
B. Clinical Presentation
1.	Habitual snoring sometimes accompanied by snorts, gasps, or intermittent pauses in breathing. Increased respiratory effort during sleep.
2.	Disturbed or restless sleep with increased arousals and awakenings.
3.	Daytime cognitive and/or behavioral problems. Young children rarely
present with daytime sleepiness.
4.	Long-­term complications: neurocognitive impairment, behavioral problems,
poor growth, cardiac dysfunction, systemic and pulmonary hypertension.
5.	Risk factors: adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, family history of OSAS,
craniofacial or laryngeal anomalies, prematurity, nasal/pharyngeal
inflammation, cerebral palsy, and neuromuscular disease.
C. Diagnosis
1.	All children and adolescents should be routinely screened for snoring.
2.	If a child snores on a regular basis and has any of the complaints or
findings shown in Box 25.1, clinicians should obtain a polysomnogram
or, if polysomnography is not available, refer the patient to a sleep specialist or otolaryngologist for more extensive evaluation.

Evidence-­based safe infant sleep recommendations to reduce the risk of sleep-­
related infant death from the 2016 AAP guidelines include the following46:
a.	Back to sleep during every episode of sleep.
b.	Using a firm sleep surface without soft objects or loose bedding.
c.	Room sharing with the infant on a separate surface, ideally for the
first year of life, but at least for the first 6 months.
d.	Avoidance of overheating and head covering.
e.	Avoidance of alcohol, illicit drugs, and smoke exposure during pregnancy and after birth.
f.	Protective factors that should be recommended: Regular prenatal
care, breastfeeding, routine immunizations.
g.	Modeling of safe sleep by healthcare providers/staff, day care providers,
and in advertising.

IX. BRIEF RESOLVED UNEXPLAINED EVENT (BRUE)47,48
A. Definition
Formerly termed an apparent life-­threatening event (ALTE), a BRUE is
defined as an event involving an infant below 1 year of age when the
observer reports a sudden, brief (typically 20 to 30 seconds) and now
resolved episode of at least one of the following:
1.	Cyanosis or pallor
2.	Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing
3.	Marked change in muscle tone (hyper-­or hypotonia)
4.	Altered level of responsiveness
B. Differential Diagnosis
The three most common differential diagnoses are GER, seizure, and lower
respiratory tract infection. If an explanation for the event is identified, then
it is not a BRUE.
C. Management
An algorithm for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of
BRUE patients is provided in Fig. 25.11.

C. Childhood Sleep Disorders44,45
1.	Insomnia
a.	Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both.
b.	In younger children, the common behavioral insomnias of childhood
include limit-­setting (bedtime resistance) and sleep-­onset association disorder (night wakings). Treatment includes bedtime limits and
appropriate sleep hygiene.
c.	In older children, psychosocial or primary insomnia is characterized
by excessive worry about sleep and the consequences of inadequate
sleep. Managed with behavioral interventions.
d.	Insomnia can be secondary to another sleep or medical disorder. A
comprehensive evaluation is required. Referral to a sleep specialist
or behavioral psychologist may be useful.
2.	Nighttime fears
a.	Common condition that is part of normal development and stems
from cognitive development.
b.	Characterized by tearful, fearful behavior at bedtime.
c.	Relieved by sleeping with member of household.
d.	Treatment involves reassurance, teaching coping skills, and use of
security objects. Consider evaluation for anxiety disorder in older
children/adolescents.
3.	Nightmares
a.	Frightening dreams that result in awakening from sleep.
b.	Part of normal development.
c.	Peak at age 6 to 10 years.
d.	May be reduced by reducing stressors, avoiding exposure to frightening images, and ensuring adequate sleep.
4.	Delayed sleep phase syndrome
a.	A circadian rhythm with a persistent, intractable shift in the sleep-­
wake cycle. Patients move to a late bedtime and late awakening.
b.	Seen most commonly in adolescent and young adults.
c.	Patients have daytime sleepiness and tardiness/absenteeism when
unable to sleep during the day.
d.	Treatment includes behavioral therapy, bright light exposure, and
melatonin. Consider evaluation by a sleep specialist.
5.	Parasomnias
a.	Common and benign disorders of arousal.
b.	Includes sleepwalking, night terrors, and confusional arousals.
c.	Onset typically at age 4 to 6 years and usually disappear by
adolescence.

I. GENERAL PEDIATRIC PRINCIPLES
A. Limit Radiation Exposure
1.	Children are at increased radiation risk given their greater lifetime exposure, relatively small size, increased radiosensitivity, and longer lives
during which to manifest side effects.1
2.	Use evidence-­based imaging guidelines to guide appropriate imaging
choice and minimize radiation exposure.1
3.	See Table 26.1 for relative radiation by imaging study.
B. Use Imaging Judiciously
1.	Minimize use of ionizing radiation when possible.
2.	Limit imaging to indicated areas to improve resolution and minimize
radiation exposure.
3.	Provide adequate clinical background when ordering imaging studies to
assist radiologist.
II. CHOOSING THE RIGHT STUDY
1.	See Table 26.2 for descriptions of imaging modalities.
2.	Computed tomography (CT) versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):
CT is often more readily available, can be performed quickly, and does
not require sedation; however, CT raises safety concerns regarding
radiation exposure. MRI uses nonionizing radiation and may require
sedation.1
3.	Contrast: Helps distinguish selected body areas from surrounding tissue. Oral and rectal contrast is used for bowel opacification.
Intravenous is used to opacify vascular structures and solid organs.
III. HEAD
Head ultrasound (HUS) can be used for infants with open anterior fontanelles. CT is preferred for acute situations (e.g., trauma, hemorrhage) and
for evaluating bone structure or calcifications. MRI offers better soft-­tissue
contrast and visualization of brain anatomy and is, therefore, preferred for
most nontraumatic intracranial pathology. MRI fast sequences (such as
ultrafast [UF] MRI) uses specialized sequencing to assess ventricular size
and shunt position without requiring sedation. Does not allow for adequate
delineation and diagnosis of other brain pathology.1

A. Head Trauma
1.	Preferred imaging: Noncontrast head CT. Use the Pediatric Emergency
Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules to decide whether
imaging is indicated (see Chapter 2).2,3
B. CSF Shunt Malfunction
1.	Preferred imaging: Ultrafast brain MRI (UF MRI).
2.	Other imaging: CT if UF MRI is not available or contraindicated. Shunt
series (plain radiographs evaluating shunt tubing) are useful.
C. Orbital Cellulitis
1.	Preferred imaging: Orbital contrast-­enhanced CT (Fig. EC 26.A).4
IV. NECK AND AIRWAY
Conventional radiography (CR) anteroposterior (AP) and lateral neck views
are preferred initial imaging.5,6
A. Normal Anatomy
1.	Normal anatomy (Figs. 26.1 and 26.2).
2.	Reading lateral C-­spine films.
a.	Must visualize skull base, C1 to C7, top of T1.
b.	Assess alignment by evaluating four curvilinear contour lines: anterior
vertebral, posterior vertebral, spinolaminar, tips of spinous process
(Fig. 26.3).
c.	Evaluate vertebral bodies for fractures, displacement, subluxation,
dislocations. Vertebral bodies should be same height and uniformity
below C2.
d.	Evaluate predental and prevertebral spaces for widening.
B. Cervical Spine Trauma
1.	Initial imaging: CR, lateral and AP.
2.	Other imaging: MRI if high clinical suspicion of C-­spine injury without CR
findings.

2.	Viral Infections
a.	Nonspecific chest x-­ray (CXR) findings (often overlaps with bacterial
infections): Bilateral interstitial opacities, peribronchial thickening
(cuffing), hyperinflation, subsegmental atelectasis (Fig. EC 26.E).9
3.	Bacterial Pneumonia
a.	CXR findings: Alveolar consolidation, air bronchograms (Fig. EC
26.F).9,10
b.	Localizing pneumonia on CXR:
(1)	
Silhouette sign: Loss of normal borders between thoracic structures of same density; used to localize lung pathology (Table
26.3).10
(2)	
Spine sign: Vertebral bodies of thoracic spine become less
opaque (blacker) as moving inferiorly toward diaphragm.
Soft tissue or fluid density involving posterior lower lobe adds
density causing spine to become more opaque (whiter) above
diaphragm.1,10
c.	Patterns of pneumonia
Certain radiographic patterns are highly suggestive of particular microorganisms but impossible to identify with certainty (Table EC 26.A).10
C. Neonatal Lung Disease
1.	Respiratory distress syndrome (or hyaline membrane disease):
Hypoinflation, symmetrical hazy reticulogranular opacities, prominent
air bronchograms, poor definition of pulmonary vessels.6-­8
2.	Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): Interstitial edema, small
pleural effusions, increased vascular markings, mildly enlarged cardiothymic silhouette, hyperinflation.6,7
3.	Meconium aspiration syndrome: Bilateral, asymmetric areas of hyperinflation and atelectasis; asymmetric perihilar opacities, which can
be associated with pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural
effusions.7,8
4.	Neonatal pneumonia: Bilateral, patchy interstitial opacities,
hyperinflation.7
D. Mediastinal Masses
1.	Preferred imaging: CR followed by contrast-­enhanced CT.
2.	Findings: Middle mediastinal masses silhouetting the heart border and
aorta.1
VI. HEART (SEE CHAPTER 7)
ECHO is the first-­line imaging modality. Cardiac MR (CMR) evaluates
extracardiac anatomy; gold standard for quantifying ventricular volume,
mass, and ejection fraction; creates a three-­dimensional reconstructions
of complex congenital heart disease (CHD) without radiation. Cardiac CT
is alternative if CMR is contraindicated (see Fig. 26.4 for normal cardiac
findings on CXR).1,8

VII. ABDOMEN
CR used for initial workup; two-­view studies (supine and upright) are often
preferred. Decubitus and cross-­table lateral views can help localize free air,
foreign bodies, and enteric tubes; may replace upright view if needed.7 US is
the initial modality for abdominal masses, ascites, appendicitis, abscesses,
and biliary pathology.1 CT is preferred for trauma and further evaluation.1 MRI
is becoming more frequently utilized, including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for pancreatitis, biliary pathology, and trauma;
and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease to assess disease activity, extent of bowel involvement,
and extraintestinal complications.1 Cross-­sectional imaging (US, CT, or MR)
is preferred for suspected inflammation, infection, tumors, and lymphadenopathy. Upper GI (UGI) series can assess upper GI obstruction in neonates,
malrotation, anatomic malformations, and motility problems.7
A. Normal Abdominal X-­ray and Bowel Gas Pattern
1.	Neonatal bowel gas pattern: Gas should be present in stomach by 15
minutes of life, in proximal small bowel by 30 to 60 minutes, in most of
small intestine by 6 hours, and in colon by 12 to 24 hours (Fig. 26.5).6,11
Bowel loop diameter and bowel wall thickness should be uniform.5
2.	After infancy, pockets of gas should be visualized in small bowel, colon,
and rectum.
3.	Small bowel seen if contains gas, located centrally, has valvulae
(extends across bowel), normal diameter smaller than 3 cm.
4.	Large bowel contains gas and stool, located peripherally, has haustra
(extends partially across bowel), normal diameter smaller than 5 cm.
B. Pneumoperitoneum (Free Intraperitoneal Air)
1.	Preferred imaging: CR including upright imaging (cross-­table or decubitus lateral if patient unable to stand or sit).
2.	Other imaging: CT confirms diagnosis, detects small amounts of air not
seen on CR.10
3.	Findings: Air under diaphragm
a.	Continuous diaphragm sign: Air under entire diaphragm, including
underneath heart silhouette

progressed through small bowel and by 24 hours of life (B) air can be visualized in the
rectum.

616  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
b.	Falciform ligament sign: Ability to visualize normally invisible falciform ligament as free air surrounds ligament (Fig. EC 26.G)
c.	Football sign: Oval appearance of abdominal cavity outlined by gas
with visualization of falciform ligament, seen in massive pneumoperitoneum (see Fig. EC 26.G)10
C. Neonatal Enterocolitis (see Chapter 18)
1.	Initial imaging: CR, include cross-­table lateral or left decubitus views to
evaluate for free air.7
2.	Other imaging: Intestinal US if high clinical suspicion for NEC and CR nonspecific or inconclusive, as can depict changes in intra-­abdominal fluid,
bowel wall thickness, and bowel wall perfusion before findings on CR.12
3.	CR findings: Nonspecific signs: Diffuse gaseous distention (most
common), loss of normal symmetrical distribution of gas, persistence
of single dilated bowel loop (fixed loop sign). Pathognomonic signs:
Pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas with “bubbly” appearance
commonly in distal small bowel and colon), portal venous gas (branching lucencies seen projecting over liver) (Fig. 26.6).7
D. Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction
1.	Difficult to distinguish small from large bowel in neonates.5
2.	Initial imaging: CR to decipher high obstruction (stomach to proximal
ileum) from low obstruction (distal ileum to colon).
3.	Further imaging: UGI series or esophagram (obstruction proximal to
ligament of Treitz), UGI series with small bowel follow-through (ligament of Treitz to ileocecal junction), contrast enema (distal to ileocecal
junction).5,7,9
4.	High intestinal obstruction
a.	CR findings: Few dilated loops of bowel.
b.	Duodenal atresia: Double bubble on CR (Fig. EC 26.H), reflecting air
in dilated stomach and proximal duodenum with absence of air distally. If partial obstruction, UGI series further differentiates duodenal
stenosis or web from midgut volvulus.7
c.	Malrotation: Malpositioned duodenojejunal junction/ligament of Treitz
(normally at level of duodenal bulb and to left of spine). UGI series is
the gold standard. US can be used for rapid screening.5,7
5.	Low intestinal obstruction
a.	CR findings: Multiple dilated loops of bowel; assess further with
contrast enema.
b.	Ileal atresia: Contrast enema shows opacification of diffusely small
caliber large bowel (microcolon). Contrast refluxes into distal ileum,
but unable to reflux further. Bowel proximal to distal ileum is air filled
and dilated.
c.	Hirschsprung disease: Contrast enema shows “transition zone”
between nondilated aganglionic distal colon and normal, relatively
distended, proximal colon.7

2.	Findings: Abnormal thickening of pyloric muscle (≥3 mm) and elongation of pyloric channel (>15 to 17 mm).10
F. Intussusception
1.	Preferred imaging: RUQ US.1
2.	Findings: Donut, target, or pseudo-­kidney sign.1
3.	Treatment: Pneumatic enema reduction under fluoroscopic guidance.1

618  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
G. Ileus
1.	Preferred imaging: CR.
2.	Findings: Small and large bowel distention.1,10
H. Mechanical Bowel Obstruction
1.	Initial imaging: CR. Supine view for identifying gas pattern. Upright/
erect, cross-­table lateral, or lateral decubitus for identifying free air and
air-­fluid levels.
2.	Other imaging: CT with oral contrast determines obstruction site. CT with
IV contrast to detect complications such as ischemia.10 Note: CR has
low sensitivity for identifying bowel obstruction; therefore, CT should be
obtained if obstruction clinically suspected.
3.	Findings: Dilated loops of bowel proximal to obstruction, little to no air in
rectum.1
a.	Small bowel obstruction: Numerous air-­fluid levels. Distended bowel
normally more central.
b.	Large bowel obstruction: Few to no air-­fluid levels. Distended bowel
normally more peripheral.
I. Appendicitis
1.	Preferred imaging: RLQ US.
2.	Other imaging: MRI if US equivocal. CT only if MRI unavailable or
patient unstable or cannot tolerate MRI.1,7
3.	US findings: Fluid-­filled, noncompressible, blind-­ending tubular structure greater than 6 mm in diameter.1,7
J. Esophageal Foreign Bodies
1.	Preferred imaging: CR, evaluate entire GI tract (AP/lateral neck, chest,
abdomen).
2.	Other imaging: Esophagram with water-­soluble contrast if suspicion high
but CR negative.7
3.	Findings: Most commonly lodged at thoracic inlet. Only radiopaque
objects can be visualized on CR. May see mass effect on adjacent
structures from swelling caused by foreign body.
a.	Coins (most common): Flat object on frontal view with edge visualized on lateral.
b.	Disk batteries: Bilaminar structure, must identify as may cause serious chemical injury.7
K. Abdominal Trauma
1.	Preferred imaging: CT with IV contrast.
2.	Other imaging: If hemodynamically unstable, rapid bedside US using
focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) protocol to
evaluate for free fluid.7 FAST evaluates bilateral upper quadrants, bilateral pericolic gutters, pelvis, and pericardium.1
L. Gallbladder Disease
1.	Preferred imaging: US. Patients should fast for 6 hours prior to allow for
gallbladder filling.1

Chapter 26 Radiology  619

VIII. GENITOURINARY TRACT
Renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS): first-­line imaging modality; evaluates
kidneys, ureters, and bladder; can assess calculi. Fluoroscopic voiding
cystourethrogram (VCUG), radionuclide cystourethrography (RNC), and
contrast-­enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) assess for vesicoureteral
reflux. Nuclear renal scintigraphy (Mag-­3 scan) assesses renal perfusion,
function, and excretion. Cross-­sectional imaging (CT, MR, MR urography)
assesses for genitourinary (GU) tract tumors or obstruction. Additionally,
MR urography can evaluate renal function and unenhanced CT can assess
collecting system calculi.7
A. Urinary Tract Infection
See Chapter 19.
B. Nephrolithiasis/Urolithiasis
1.	Preferred imaging: US
2.	Other imaging: Noncontrast CT if US equivocal.1,7
3.	US findings: Echogenic, shadowing foci.7
4.	CT findings: Radiodense stones, dilated ureteral or collection system,
asymmetric enlargement of kidney.1
C. Testicular Pathology
1.	Preferred imaging: Duplex US.1
2.	Testicular torsion findings: Absence of blood flow to center of testicle.1
3.	Acute epididymitis findings: Enlarged epididymis, scrotal thickening,
reactive hydrocele, increased blood flow.1
D. Ovarian Pathology
1.	Preferred imaging: Pelvic US.
2.	Ovarian cyst findings: Well-­circumscribed anechoic structures within
pelvis measuring more than 3 cm in diameter. Hyperechoic material
within cyst indicates possible hemorrhage.9
3. Ovarian torsion findings: Variable appearance, usually unilateral enlarged
solid ovary with multiple peripheral follicles.9 Absence or presence of
flow on duplex not a reliable indicator of torsion.7

26

2.	Findings: Posterior acoustic shadowing in cholelithiasis. Nonshadowing
echogenic foci if stone disease, polyps, other masses. Gallbladder wall
thickening (>3 mm), positive sonographic Murphy’s sign (localized
tenderness with transducer palpation over gallbladder), sludge, and
pericholecystic fluid with cholelithiasis in acute cholecystitis.1
M. Pancreatitis
1.	Initial imaging: US.
2.	Other imaging: CT with IV contrast if lack of clinical improvement or
equivocal US. MRCP for detecting choledocholithiasis and biliary/pancreatic duct anomalies.13
3.	US findings: Pancreatic duct dilation, abnormal echogenicity, peripancreatic fluid.1,7

620  Part II Diagnostic and Therapeutic Information
E. Congenital Hydronephrosis
1.	Normally first detected on fetal US, defined as AP renal pelvis diameter
greater than 4 mm in second trimester and greater than 7 mm in third
trimester.
2.	Preferred imaging: US to confirm postnatally, as can resolve spontaneously. Do not perform until at least 48 hours after delivery given risk of
false negatives or underestimation of severity.1
3.	Findings: Moderate-­to-­severe hydronephrosis (>10 mm) with
clinical suspicion or family history warrants further evaluation
with VCUG. Repeat US at age 4 to 6 weeks to confirm absence of
hydronephrosis.1,14
IX. MUSCULOSKELETAL
CR is the primary imaging modality; used in trauma, infection, and suspected
bone lesions.7 MRI provides superior contrast resolution of soft tissue and bone
marrow; preferred for patellar dislocation and avulsion fractures. Use IV contrast
to delineate inflammation, ischemia, revascularization, and tumors.1 US used for
superficial soft-­tissue masses and suspected joint effusions.
A. Fractures and Trauma
1.	Preferred imaging: CR. For long bones, obtain at least two projections. For
joints, obtain at least three projections and evaluate proximal and distal
joint. Fractures may not be seen on initial XR; consider repeat XRs in 7 to
10 days as may visualize periosteal reactions around healing fracture.1,7
2.	Findings: Abrupt disruption of the cortex or acute angulation of smooth
contour of normal bone.10 Indirect signs: soft-­tissue swelling, joint effusion, periosteal reaction (if subacute or healing).
3.	Describing fractures.10
a.	Location: Laterality, location on bone, relation to joint (intra-­articular,
extra-­articular).
b.	Type: Complete (through whole cortex), incomplete (retains some
continuity [e.g., plastic, bowing, torus, greenstick]), Salter-­Harris
(involves growth plate) (Table 26.4)
c.	Number of fragments: Simple (two fragments) or comminuted (>2).
d.	Direction of fracture lines: Transverse (perpendicular to long axis),
oblique/diagonal (diagonal in orientation relative to long axis), spiral
(corkscrew, twisting).
e.	Relationship (distal fracture fragment to proximal fragment):
Displacement (amount distal fragment is offset in nonlongitudinal
axis), angulation (angle between fragments), apposition (amount of
contact between fragments), shortening (amount of overlap between
fragments, change in bone length), distraction (distance fragments
are separated in longitudinal axis), rotation (orientation of joint at one
end of fracture relative to joint at other end).
f.	Open versus closed: Open or compound (communication between
fracture and outside atmosphere), closed or simple.

4.	Common pediatric fracture patterns: see Chapter 2.
5.	Elbow XRs.
a.	Anterior humeral line: Line drawn tangential to anterior humeral
cortex should bisect middle third of capitellum. If line more anterior,
supracondylar fracture should be suspected (Figs. 26.7 and 26.8).10
b.	Radiocapitellar line: Line drawn through the center of radial neck
should pass through the center of capitellum. If it does not, dislocation should be suspected (see Figs. 26.7 and 26.8).14
c.	Ossification centers: Mnemonic CRITOE commonly used to remember
sequential order of appearance (Table EC 26.B and Fig. EC 26.I).15
d.	Fat pad: Normal lateral view of flexed elbow shows only anterior fat
pad (lucency). Elevated anterior fat pad and visible posterior fat pad
indicates intra-­articular injury and possible radial head fracture (positive fat-­pad sign) (Fig. 26.9).12
e.	Hourglass sign (‘figure-­of-­eight’): On a true lateral view, an hourglass or figure-­of-­eight configuration can be visualized on the distal
humerus (see Fig. 26.9).
B. Osteomyelitis
1.	Initial imaging: CR. Findings often lag 7 to 14 days after symptom onset;
however, may rule out or identify alternative diagnosis.1
2.	Preferred imaging: MRI. Findings can be seen as early as 24 to 48
hours after symptom onset.1,16
3.	Findings: Metaphysis of long bones most frequently affected. CR: soft-­
tissue swelling, bony destruction, cortical loss, periosteal reaction.16
C. Hip Disorders
1.	Developmental dysplasia of the hip
a.	Preferred imaging: US, typically around 6 weeks of age.
b.	Other imaging: Once femoral heads ossify (within 3 to 6 months), CR
more helpful.7

2.	Idiopathic avascular necrosis of femoral head (Legg-­Calvé-­Perthes disease).
a.	Initial imaging: CR, AP pelvis and frog-­leg lateral hip.
b.	Other imaging: MRI, more sensitive for early disease, useful if CR is
nondiagnostic.7
c.	Findings: Small capital femoral epiphysis, sclerotic femoral head,
widened joint space, curvilinear subchondral lucency from subchondral fracture (crescent sign).7
3.	Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)
a.	Initial imaging: CR, AP and frog-­leg lateral views of pelvis.
b.	Findings: Asymmetric widening and/or lucency of proximal femoral
physis, posterior and inferomedial displacement of femoral head relative to femoral neck (ice cream falling off cone). Can assess femoral
head position by drawing line along lateral aspect of the femoral neck
(Klein’s line), which should intersect the capital femoral epiphysis in
normal anatomy (Fig. EC 26.J).7

I. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
RHEUMATOLOGIC DISEASES
A. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)1–­5
1.	JIA involves joint swelling or limitation/tenderness upon range of motion
lasting at least 6 weeks, shown not to be due to another identifiable
cause, and presenting in children less than 16 years of age.
2.	See Table 27.1 for information organized by the divisions of the disease.
B. Reactive Arthritis6–­8
1.	Affects males more than females (3:1).
2.	Sterile inflammatory arthritis as a response to preceding (1 to 4 weeks)
bacterial or viral infection, particularly of the respiratory, gastrointestinal,
or genitourinary tracts.
3.	Involves acute asymmetrical oligoarticular arthritis of larger joints, often
the lower extremities.
4.	Associated with fever, weight loss, fatigue, tendinitis, bursitis, anterior
uveitis, conjunctivitis, erythema nodosum, urethritis, and cervicitis.
C. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)1,9–­11
1.	SLE typically affects women of childbearing age (occurring nine times
more often in women than men).
2.	People of African descent and Native Americans are affected more
commonly than Caucasians.
3.	See Box 27.1 for clinical criteria for diagnosis.
D. Drug-­Induced Systemic Lupus Erythematosus1,6,9
1.	Manifests as polyarthritis, myalgia, fever, and serositis, which resolve
after discontinuation of the inciting drug.
2.	Inciting drugs include but are not limited to hydralazine, minocycline,
procainamide, quinidine, isoniazid, interferon-­alfa, chlorpromazine,
ethosuximide, carbamazepine, therapy against tumor necrosis factor
alpha (anti-­TNF α therapy).
E. Neonatal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus1,12
1.	Neonates born to mothers with active SLE can develop a transient
lupus-­like syndrome due to transplacental passage of anti-­Ro (anti-­
SS-­A) and anti-­La (anti-­SS-­B) antibodies.
2.	Inflammatory features resolve within 6 months as maternal autoantibodies are cleared.

F. Vasculitis (Table 27.2)1,6,13–­23
G. Sarcoidosis6,14,24–­26
1.	Before puberty (very rare): primarily affects Caucasians. During and
after puberty: predominantly affects African Americans. Males and
females affected equally.
2.	Multisystem, infiltrative, noncaseating granulomatous disease of
unknown etiology.
3.	Lung is the organ most commonly involved; however, it can involve
nearly all organ systems and have widespread manifestations including
but not limited to:
a.	Pulmonary: Bilateral hilar adenopathy, restrictive and obstructive
disease.
b.	CNS: Bilateral or unilateral Bell palsy, seizures, aseptic meningitis.
c.	Cutaneous: Erythema nodosum, plaques, alopecia.
H. Scleroderma6,14,27
1.	Both juvenile localized scleroderma and juvenile systemic sclerosis
typically present in mid-­childhood between 6 and 11 years of age with a
female predominance.
2.	Localized (limited) scleroderma: More common than systemic; sclerosis
limited to skin, muscle, and bone.
3.	Diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma: Fibrous degenerative changes
of skin, synovium, digital arteries, and internal organs (gastrointestinal
tract, heart, lungs, kidneys, and esophagus).
I. Sjögren Syndrome1,6,14,28
1.	Female-­to-­male ratio 5:1 in children.
2.	Widespread lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal glands with
secondary atrophy and obliteration of secretory acini.
3.	Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes secondary to decreased tear production by lacrimal glands).
4.	Xerostomia (dry mouth from decreased salivary gland production).
5.	May present as parotid gland swelling in children.

II. INTERPRETATION OF LABORATORY STUDIES USED IN THE
DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF RHEUMATOLOGIC DISEASES
Most laboratory studies used to diagnose rheumatic diseases are nonspecific, and results must be interpreted within the context of the full clinical
picture. Once a diagnosis is established, however, they can be used to
follow the condition’s clinical course, indicating flares or remission of the
rheumatic disease.
A. Acute-­Phase Reactants
Indicate presence of inflammation when elevated. Elevation is nonspecific
and can result from trauma, infection, rheumatic diseases, or malignancy.1
Markers include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-­reactive protein
(CRP), platelet count, ferritin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, serum amyloid A,
and complement.1,6

1.	ESR
a.	Measure of the rate of fall of red blood cells in anticoagulated blood
within a vertical tube; reflects level of rouleaux formation caused by
acute-­phase reactants.1
b.	Can be falsely lowered in afibrinogenemia, polycythemia, and sickle
cell disease; these states interfere with rouleaux formation.2
c.	Can be outside normal range for age due to obesity, pregnancy, and
anemia.29
d.	Serial measurements may help in monitoring disease severity or
activity in conditions such as SLE and JIA.

2.	CRP1,30
a.	Synthesized by the liver, assists in clearance of pathologic bacteria
and damaged cells via activation of complement-­mediated phagocytosis, and mediates acute inflammation by altering cytokine release.
b.	Increases and decreases rapidly owing to short half-­life (approximately 18 hours).14
c.	Elevation is nonspecific, indicating only inflammation:
(1)	Most active phases of rheumatic disease result in elevation to 1 to
10 mg/dL.
(2)	Level greater than 10 mg/dL raises concern for bacterial infection
or systemic vasculitis.31
B. Autoantibodies (Table 27.3)14
The positive predictive value of any autoantibody assay depends on clinical
context. These studies can prove valuable in confirming clinical suspicion.
Sensitivities and specificities must be considered with any clinical decision.
1.	Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
a.	ANA is a nonspecific test for SLE and other rheumatic disease.1
b.	Positive in approximately 60% to 70% of children with an autoimmune disease, but can be seen in about 25% of the normal
population.32,33
c.	If positive, consider ordering individual autoantibodies.6
d.	Can be positive in nonrheumatologic diseases33:
(1)	Malignancy (e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia)
(2)	Infections (transiently positive): Mononucleosis, endocarditis,
hepatitis, malaria
e.	If positive in JIA, there is increased risk of chronic uveitis.29
2.	Rheumatoid factor (RF)1,29
a.	M antibodies to the Fc portion of IgG.
b.	Positive in rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases:
(1)	Rheumatic diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, scleroderma, and primary Sjögren
syndrome.
(2)	Infections: Hepatitis B/C, subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes.
c.	Negative RF does not rule out rheumatic disease.
d.	Prognostic importance in polyarticular JIA: Positive RF suggests
more aggressive disease.29
3.	Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-­CCP) antibodies
a.	Known to be highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis in adults; found
primarily in children with polyarticular JIA.29
b.	Anti-­CCP positivity correlates with erosive joint disease in JIA.34,35

C. Complement1,5
The complement system is composed of a series of plasma proteins and
cellular receptors that function together to mediate host defense and
inflammation. Inflammatory processes may increase the synthesis of
complement proteins or increase their consumption.
1.	Total hemolytic complement level (CH50)
a.	Immune complex disease leads to depletion of complement components and decreased level of CH50.
b.	Increased in the acute phase response of numerous inflammatory
states.
c.	Useful screening test for homozygous complement deficiency states
which have the strongest association with SLE.29
d.	Typically decreased in SLE, acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, subacute bacterial endocarditis.14
2.	C3 and C4
a.	Most common complement proteins assayed.
b.	May be increased or decreased in rheumatic diseases, depending on
disease stage or severity.
c.	Decreased levels of complement proteins:
(1)	Indicator of immune complex formation.
(2)	Complete deficiency of C3 manifests as severe, recurrent infections with pyogenic organisms.14
(3)	Can occur in active SLE, some vasculitides, and multiple infections, including gram-­negative sepsis, hepatitis, and pneumococcal infections.
(4)	Decreased levels typically signify more severe SLE, particularly
with regard to renal disease.
(5)	Persistently low C3 associated with lupus nephritis.
(6)	Severe hepatic failure: Synthesis of complement proteins occurs
primarily in the liver.
(7)	Congenital complement deficiency, which may predispose to
development of autoimmune disease.
d.	Increased levels of complement proteins:
(1)	Indicates the active phase of most rheumatic diseases (e.g., JIA,
dermatomyositis).
(2)	May be seen in multiple infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumococcal
pneumonia) as part of the acute-­phase response.
III. PRIMARY CARE MANAGEMENT OF RHEUMATOLOGIC
DISEASES36,38,39
A. Vaccination
1.	Patients on immunosuppressive therapies cannot receive live vaccines,
but can receive killed/inactivated vaccines.
2.	Special considerations should be made for immunocompromised
patients on biologic or immunosuppressive therapy (see Chapter 16).

B. Weight Management
1.	Obesity and cushingoid fat distribution often result from chronic steroid
use.
2.	In addition to physical health consequences, this may also cause psychologic issues.
C. Bone and Skin Health
1.	Patients with arthritis or on chronic steroids are at increased risk of
osteopenia. Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and weight-­
bearing activities.
2.	Patients with SLE and dermatomyositis are particularly vulnerable to
ultraviolet radiation. They should not be exposed to the sun without
wearing a broad-­spectrum sunscreen with a high sun-­protection factor
(SPF) and should not use tanning booths.
D. Reproductive Health
1.	Disease-­modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics, especially methotrexate, are teratogenic.
2.	Teenage patients should receive counseling on the use of contraception.
E. Other Aspects of Primary Care Coordination
1.	Children with JIA have an increased risk of developing uveitis, which
is often insidious and asymptomatic. Routine pediatric ophthalmologic
screening is required.37
a.	The first ophthalmologic exam should occur within 1 month of
diagnosis.
b.	In active disease, exams should occur every 3 months regardless of
ANA status.
c.	In inactive disease, frequency varies based on ANA status, disease
duration, and age of diagnosis.
2.	Patients require supportive therapies in the form of physical therapy,
occupational therapy, and input from rehabilitation specialists, psychologists, and social workers.
F. Laboratory Monitoring

Determining normal reference ranges of laboratory studies in pediatric
patients poses some major challenges. Available literature is often limited
due to small sample sizes of patients used to derive these suggested reference ranges.
The following values have been compiled from both published literature
and the Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Pathology. Reference
range values vary with the analytic method used. Consult your laboratory
for its analytic method and range of reference values, and for less commonly used parameters that are beyond the scope of this text. Additional
reference laboratory values may be found in Chapters 10 (Endocrinology),
Chapter 14 (Hematology), and Chapter 15 (Immunology and Allergy).
Special thanks to Lori Sokoll, PhD, and Stefani Thomas, PhD, for their
guidance in preparing this chapter.

NOTE: Venous blood gases can be used to assess acid-­base status, not oxygenation. PvCO2 averages
6–8 mmHg higher than PaCO2, and pH is slightly lower. Peripheral venous samples are strongly
affected by the local circulatory and metabolic environment. Capillary blood gases correlate best
with arterial pH and moderately well with PaCO2.

These reference ranges are similar to data from the SAFETY study,2 which examined 12-­to 17-­year-­old NHANES participants and identified the 95th percentile of ALT in boys to be 25.8 U/L and in girls to be 22.1 U/L. In all age groups, similar
yet slightly higher ALT cutoffs were published in Bussler et al.3 (LIFE Child cohort) and in Zierk et al.4
bAssay with bromocresol green.
cIn all age groups, similar, yet slightly higher AST cutoffs were published in Bussler et al.3 (LIFE Child cohort) and in Zierk

dSimilar data can also be referenced for all age groups in Bussler et al.3 (LIFE Child cohort) and Zierk et al.4
eIt is important to note that these values have not been validated to demonstrate increased risk of atherosclerosis or
cardiovascular events.
fControversy exists regarding optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. Some experts recommend a level ≥30 ng/mL as
sufficient.16

Biostatistics and Evidence-­
Based Medicine
Matthew Molloy, MD, MPH
I. EVIDENCE-­BASED MEDICINE
Evidence-­based medicine refers to the method of integrating individual
clinical expertise with the best available evidence from the literature.
The following is a framework on how to formulate a clinical question and
appraise the evidence1:
A. Formulate the Clinical Question (PICO Process)
1.	P: Describe the patient or problem, deciding whether the evidence
you seek is regarding therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, or cost
effectiveness.
2.	I: Describe the intervention under consideration.
3.	C: Compare the intervention with an alternative or current standard of care.
4.	O: Formulate a specific outcome of interest.
B. Search for the Evidence to Answer the Question
1.	Define search terms that fit the clinical question.
2.	Develop your search strategy using primary search sources such as
PubMed and secondary sources such as Cochrane.
3.	Review your results, and apply methodological filters to target the right
type of study.
C. Critically Appraise the Evidence
1.	Therapy
a.	Were patient groups randomized for treatment?
b.	Were groups comparable and treated equally, aside from the allocated treatment?
c.	Were study subjects and investigators blinded?
d.	Were all patients entering the trial accounted for in the groups they
were randomized to (intention to treat)?
e.	How large was the treatment effect?
2.	Diagnosis
a.	Was the test compared with an independent reference standard?
b.	Was the test evaluated in an appropriate spectrum of patients?
3.	Prognosis
a.	Were study patients defined early in their course and followed up
over a sufficient time?
b.	How likely is it that the outcomes occur during a defined time period?
c.	How precise are the estimates of prognosis?
653

654  Part III Reference
4.	Guidelines for judging causality between a variable and outcome2
a.	Is there a temporal relationship?
b.	What is the strength of association?
c.	Is there a dose-­response relationship?
d.	Were the findings replicated?
e.	Are the findings biologically plausible?
f.	What happens with cessation of exposure?
g.	Is this explanation consistent with other knowledge?
5.	Bias: Consider these types of bias that may influence results or distort
statistical findings2:
a.	Selection bias: Caused by a nonrandom or dissimilar sample
(between cases/controls or exposed/unexposed) from a population.
Examples include sampling bias, loss to follow-­up, and exclusion
bias. Mitigated by randomization and selection of participants who
are representative of the target population.
b.	Information bias: Caused by flawed collection of information about
exposures or outcomes. Examples include recall bias, observer bias,
and lead-­time bias. Mitigated by blinding researchers to subject
status and standardizing data collection procedures.
D. Apply the Evidence to the Clinical Question
If the evidence is valid and important, integrate it with your clinical expertise and decide whether:
1.	The patient will benefit from the therapy and be able to tolerate potential
harms.
2.	The test is available, affordable, accurate, and precise.

II. BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
A. Statistical Tests
The following statistical tests are used to determine whether observed differences are statistically significant (Table 29.1).3-­5
1.	Parametric tests are used when data follow a particular distribution
(e.g., a normal distribution—a bell-­shaped distribution where the
median, mean, and mode are all equal). These tests are generally more
powerful.
2.	Nonparametric tests are used when a particular distribution cannot be
assumed; they rank data rather than taking absolute differences into
account.
3.	Unpaired tests compare values from independent samples.
4.	Paired tests are performed on paired data. For example, where the
same parameter is measured on each patient before and after an
intervention.
5.	Two-­tailed tests should be used when an intervention could potentially
lead to either an increase or decrease of the outcome.
6.	One-­tailed tests should be used when an intervention can have only one
plausible effect on the outcome.

different statistical tests. BMJ. 1997;315(7104):364–366.

B. Statistical Terminology
1.	α (Alpha): Significance level of a statistical test3,6
a.	α: Probability of making a type I error; the probability of rejecting the
null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., a difference is
seen by chance alone).

29

Purpose of Test

656  Part III Reference
b.	α is typically set at less than 0.05 in medical research, which
allows interpretation with 95% certainty that a detected association is true.
c.	The P value is the probability of obtaining the observed values if
the null hypothesis is true. For example, if P = 0.01, there is a 1 in
100 chance of the values being from chance alone. The P value is
judged against α, the preset level of significance. If P is less than
the significance level α, the detected association is considered
significant.
2.	β (Beta): Power of a statistical test
a.	β: Probability of making a type II error; the probability of accepting
the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., no
difference is seen even though there is one).
b.	Power = 1 − β: Probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis
(i.e., finding a difference when there truly is one).
c.	Power is typically set at a minimum of 0.80, which allows interpretation with 80% certainty that a detected lack of association is
true.
3.	Sample size: The number of subjects required in a study to detect an
effect with a predetermined power and α.
4.	95% confidence interval: Describes the values between which there is
a 95% chance that the true population value falls. When confidence
intervals for groups overlap, they have no statistically significant
difference.
5.	Confounder: A variable associated with both the disease and the
exposure (risk factor), leading to detection of a false relationship
between the disease and exposure if the confounder is not accounted
for. Can be controlled for by adjustment, matching, blinding, and
randomization.
6.	Effect modifier (interaction): A variable that modifies the observed effect
of an exposure on disease. For example, if a new drug is effective in
female children but not male children, then sex is an effect modifier.
Can be controlled by stratification.
C. Types of Study Designs7 (see Table 29.2)
D. Measurement of Disease Occurrence and Treatment Effects2:

Discontinue use at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs of an allergic
reaction. Avoid use in individuals with HLA-B*58:01 allele as they are at significant
risk for developing severe cutaneous adverse reactions (e.g., Stevens Johnson
Syndrome and TEN). Side effects include rash, neuritis, hepatotoxicity, GI disturbance,
bone marrow suppression, and drowsiness. Adjust dose in renal insufficiency (see
Chapter 31). Must maintain adequate urine output and alkaline urine.
Drug interactions: increases serum theophylline level; may increase the incidence of rash
with ampicillin and amoxicillin; increased risk of toxicity with azathioprine, didanosine and
mercaptopurine; and increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions with ACE inhibitors and
thiazide diuretics. Use with didanosine is contraindicated due to increased risk for
didanosine toxicity. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with clarithromycin use. IV dosage
form is very alkaline and must be diluted to a minimum concentration of 6 mg/mL and

Note: The cytochrome P450 enzyme system is composed of different isoenzymes. Each isoenzyme metabolizes a unique group of drugs or substrates. When an inhibitor of a particular isoenzyme is introduced, the serum
concentration of any drug or substrate metabolized by that particular isoenzyme will increase. When an inducer of a particular isoenzyme is introduced, the serum concentration of drugs or substrates metabolized by
that particular isoenzyme will decrease.
PPI, Proton pump inhibitor.
aOnly strong and some moderate inhibitors are listed here. Weak inhibitors also exist.

ACETAMINOPHEN continued
May be used for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus when standard NSAID is contraindicated or
has failed. Most commonly reported dosage is 15 mg/kg dose Q6 hr IV/PO for 3 days (may be given
up to 7 days or with a repeated 3-day course).
May decrease the activity of lamotrigine and increase the activity/toxicity of busulfan, warfarin, and
zidovudine. Barbiturates, phenytoin, rifampin, and anticholinergic agents (e.g., scopolamine) may
decrease the effect of acetaminophen. Increased risk for hepatotoxicity may occur with barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, carmustine (with high acetaminophen doses), chronic alcohol
use, and inducers of CYP 450 2E1 (e.g., isoniazid). Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
FOR IV USE: administer dose undiluted over 15 min. Most common side effects with IV use include
nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, agitation and atelectasis in children; and nausea,
vomiting, headache and insomnia in adults. Rare risk of serious skin reactions (e.g., SJS, TEN) has
been reported.

Possible side effects (more likely with long-term therapy) include GI irritation, paresthesias, sedation,
hypokalemia, acidosis, reduced urate secretion, aplastic anemia, polyuria, and development of
renal calculi.
May increase toxicity of carbamazepine, and cyclosporine. Aspirin may increase toxicity of acetazolamide. May decrease the effects of salicylates, lithium and phenobarbital. False-positive urinary
protein may occur with several assays. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

See most recent edition of the AAP Red Book for further details. Use with caution in patients
with preexisting neurologic or renal impairment (adjust dose; see Chapter 31) or
dehydration. Adequate hydration and slow (1 hr) IV administration are essential to prevent
crystallization in renal tubules. Do not use topical product on the eye or for the prevention of recurrent HSV
infections. Oral absorption is unpredictable (15%–30%); consider using valacyclovir or famciclovir for
better absorption. Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Resistant strains of
HSV and VZV have been reported in immunocompromised patients (e.g., advanced HIV infection).
Inflammation or phlebitis at the injection site and transient elevations of sCr and BUN are the most
frequent IV use side effects. Can cause renal impairment and has been associated with headache, vertigo, insomnia, encephalopathy, GI tract irritation, elevated liver function tests, rash, urticaria, arthralgia, fever, and adverse hematologic effects. Probenecid decreases acyclovir renal clearance. Acyclovir
may increase the concentration of tenofovir, and meperidine and its metabolite (normeperidine).
Topical cream acyclovir 5% in combination with hydrocortisone 1% (Xerese) is indicated for herpes
labialis (≥6 yr and adults) at a dosage of 5 applications per day for 5 days. Use a finger cot or
rubber glove when applying topical cream or ointment.
Ophthalmic ointment: patient should close his or her eyes for 1–2 min after each application and
wipe away any excess ointment. Most common side effects include stinging, punctuate keratitis,
and follicular conjunctivitis. Blepharitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

sensation of the skin may occur during the first 4 wk of use. Clean and dry the skin before each use.
ADAPALENE: Onset of therapeutic benefits seen in 8–12 wk. Common side effects include dry skin,
erythema, and scaly skin. When compared with tretinoin in clinical trials for acne vulgaris, adapalene was as effective and had a more rapid onset of clinical effects with less skin irritation.
ADAPALENE + BENZOYL PEROXIDE: Onset of therapeutic benefits seen in 4–8 wk. Side effects
reported in placebo-controlled studies include dry skin, erythema, skin irritation, and contact
dermatitis. When compared with isotretinoin in a clinical trial for nodulocystic acne, adapalene +
benzoyl peroxide plus doxycycline was not inferior to isotretinoin and was less effective in reducing
the number of total lesions (nodules, papules/pustules, and comedones).

Inhaled doses may be given more frequently than indicated. In such cases, consider cardiac
monitoring and monitoring of serum potassium (hypokalemia). Systemic effects are dose
related. Please verify the concentration of the nebulization solution used.
Safety and efficacy for the treatment of symptoms or bronchospasms associated with obstructive
airway disease have not been demonstrated for children <4 yr of age (either dose studied was not
optimal in this age or drug is not effective in this age group).
Use of oral dosage form is discouraged due to increased side effects and decreased efficacy compared with inhaled formulations.
Possible side effects include tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, insomnia, nervousness, nausea, and
headache.
The use of tube spacers or chambers may enhance efficacy of the HFA metered dose inhalers and have
been proven to be just as effective and sometimes safer than nebulizers. Do not use a spacer device
with any of the breath activated inhaler dosage forms. Breath-activated dosage forms require
patients to generate a minimum inspiratory flow rate of ≥30 L/min for proper dose activation.

Consider milligrams of theophylline available when dosing aminophylline. For oral route of
administration, use theophylline.
Monitoring serum levels is essential, especially in infants and young children. Intermittent
dosing for infants and children 1–5 yr may require Q4 hr dosing regimen due to enhanced
metabolism/clearance. Side effects: restlessness, GI upset, headache, tachycardia, seizures
(may occur in absence of other side effects with toxic levels).
Therapeutic level (as theophylline): for asthma, 10–20 mg/L; for neonatal apnea, 6–13 mg/L.
Recommended guidelines for obtaining levels:
IV bolus: 30 min after infusion
IV continuous; 12–24 hr after initiation of infusion
PO liquid, immediate-release tab (theophylline product):
Peak: 1 hr post dose
Trough: just before dose
PO sustained-release (theophylline product):
Peak: 4 hr post dose
Trough: just before dose
Ideally, obtain levels after steady state has been achieved (after at least one day of therapy). Liver
impairment, cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. See
Theophylline for drug interactions.
Use in breast feeding may cause irritability in infant. It is recommended to avoid breast feeding for 2 hr
after IV or 4 hr after immediate-release oral intermittent dose.

Overall use of this drug may be limited to its potentially life-threatening side effects and
the difficulties associated with managing its use.
Contraindicated in severe sinus node dysfunction, marked sinus bradycardia, second- and thirddegree AV block. Use with caution in hepatic impairment.
Long elimination half-life (40–55 days). Major metabolite is active. Use of premixed injection
(Nexterone) is not recommended in renal insufficiency due to accumulation of cyclodextrin excipient.
Increases cyclosporine, digoxin, phenytoin, tacrolimus, warfarin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, and quinidine levels. Amiodarone is a CYP P450 3A3/4 substrate and inhibits CYP 3A3/4, 2C9,
and 2D6. Risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased when used with simvastatin at doses greater than 20
mg/24 hr and lovastatin at doses greater than 40 mg/24 hr. Serious symptomatic bradycardia has
been reported when used with sofosbuvir.
Proposed therapeutic level with chronic oral use: 1–2.5 mg/L.
Asymptomatic corneal microdeposits should appear in all patients. Alters liver enzymes, thyroid
function. Pulmonary fibrosis reported in adults. May cause worsening of preexisting arrhythmias
with bradycardia and AV block. May also cause hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness,

Correct hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia whenever possible before use as these
conditions may exaggerate QTc prolongation.
Intravenous continuous infusion concentration for peripheral administration should not exceed 2 mg/
mL and must be diluted with D5W. The intravenous dosage form can leach out plasticizers such as
DEHP. It is recommended to reduce the potential exposure to plasticizers in pregnant women and
children at the toddler stages of development and younger by using alternative methods of IV drug
administration.
Oral administration should be consistent with regards to meals because food increases the rate and

Use with caution in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Younger children (<6 yr)
may require higher mg/kg doses than older children and adults. A BID dosing regimen may
provide better efficacy in children.
Reduce dose in hepatic insufficiency. Allow 5–7 days of continuous initial dose therapy before making dosage adjustments because of the drug’s gradual onset of action and lengthy elimination
half-life. Amlodipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and should be used with caution with 3A4
inhibitors such as protease inhibitors and azole antifungals (e.g., fluconazole and ketoconazole).
May increase levels and toxicity of cyclosporine, tacrolimus and simvastatin.
Dose-related side effects include edema, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, and palpitations. Other side
effects include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence.

See Amoxicillin for additional comments. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
Contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction
associated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Extended-release tablet dosage form is
contraindicated in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.
Clavulanic acid extends the activity of amoxicillin to include β-lactamase–producing strains of
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and some Staphylococcus
aureus and may increase the risk for diarrhea.
The BID dosing schedule is associated with less diarrhea. For BID dosing, the 875 mg, 1 g tablets,
the 200 mg, 400 mg chewable tablets or the 200 mg/5mL, 400 mg/5 mL, 600 mg/5 mL suspensions should be used. These BID dosage forms contain phenylalanine and should not be used
by phenylketonurics. For TID dosing, the 250 mg, 500 mg tablets, the 125 mg 250 mg chewable
tablets or the 125 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL suspensions should be used.
Higher doses of 80–90 mg/kg/24 hr (amoxicillin component) have been recommended for resistant
strains of S. pneumoniae in acute otitis media and pneumonia (use BID formulations containing
7:1 or 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanic acid or Augmentin ES-600, respectively).
The 250 or 500 mg tablets cannot be substituted for Augmentin XR tablets.

Use with caution in presence of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Avoid use in known
serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase
risk of sympathomimetic effects of amphetamines (sudden death, stroke, and MI have been
reported). Contraindicated with MAO inhibitors, including linezolid and IV methylene blue, as a
hypertensive crisis may occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of MAO inhibitor. Serotonin
syndrome may occur with used in combination with MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, TCAs, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone
and St. John’s Wort.
Amphetamine is a minor substrate of CYP 450 2D6. Alkalinizing agents should be avoided as they
can increase the effects/toxicity of amphetamine by decreasing its secretion. Avoid use of GI acid
blockers (e.g., PPIs) with Adzenys ER as amphetamine dose dumping may occur.

Not recommended for patients <3 yr of age. Medication should generally not be used in children <5
yr, because diagnosis of ADHD in this age group is extremely difficult (use in consultation with a
specialist). Interrupt administration occasionally to determine need for continued therapy.
Common side effects include headache, insomnia, anorexia (monitor growth), abdominal pain,
anxiety, mood swings, and agitation. Psychotic disorder, peripheral vascular disease (including
Raynaud phenomenon), and cerebrovascular accident have been reported.
Evekeo has an additional labeled indication for the treatment of exogenous obesity in ≥12 yr and
adults. Doses may be administered with or without food. Do not crush or chew the extendedrelease dispersible tabs (Adzenys XR-ODT). Shake oral suspension bottle (Adzenys ER and Dyanavel

Injection: 50 mg vials

Monitor renal, hepatic, electrolyte, and hematologic status closely. Hypercalciuria,
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, RTA, renal failure, acute hepatic failure, hypotension,
and phlebitis may occur. For dosing information in renal failure, see Chapter 31.
Common infusion-related reactions include fever, chills, headache, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting; may premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 30 min before and 4 hr after
infusion. Meperidine useful for chills. Hydrocortisone, 1 mg/mg ampho (max.: 25 mg) added to
bottle may help to prevent immediate adverse reactions. Use total body weight for obese patients
when calculating dosages.
Salt loading with 10–15 mL/kg of NS infused prior to each dose may minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity. Maintaining sodium intake of >4 mEq/kg/24 hr in premature neonates may also reduce risk for
nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, chemotherapeutic agents, and cyclosporine may result in synergistic toxicity. Hypokalemia may increase the toxicity of neuromuscular
blocking agents and cardiac glycosides.
Although there is no breast-feeding data for amphotericin, many experts believe it is compatible
since the drug is highly protein bound, has a large molecular weight and is not absorbed orally.

Ahmad Abusadeh

Used as a secondary alternative agent for patients that are unresponsive or unable to
receive sodium chloride and potassium chloride.
Correction of hypochloremia: Arginine chloride dose in milliequivalents (mEq) = 0.2 × patient’s weight (kg)
× (103 − patient’s serum chloride in mEq/L). Administer ½ to 2⁄3 of the calculated dose and reassess.
Drug administration: Do not exceed an IV infusion rate of 1 g/kg/hr (4.75 mEq/kg/hr). Drug may be
administered without further dilution but should be diluted to reduce risk of tissue irritation.
Hyperammonemia in metabolic disorders: See Chapter 13
Contraindicated in renal or hepatic failure. Use with extreme caution as overdosages may
result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, cerebral edema, and death. Hypersensitivity
reactions, including anaphylaxis, and hematuria have been reported.
Arginine hydrochloride is metabolized to nitrogen-containing products for renal excretion. Excess
arginine increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) to cause vasodilation/hypotension. Closely
monitor acid/base status. Hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, GI disturbances, IV extravasation,
headache, and flushing may occur.
In addition to its use for chloride supplementation, arginine is used in urea cycle disorder therapy
(increase arginine levels and prevent breakdown of endogenous proteins) and as a diagnostic
agent for growth hormone (stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone).

Do not use in children <16 yr for treatment of varicella or flulike symptoms (risk for Reye
syndrome), in combination with other NSAIDs, or in severe renal failure. Use with caution
in bleeding disorders, renal dysfunction, gastritis, and gout. May cause GI upset, allergic
reactions, liver toxicity, and decreased platelet aggregation.
Drug interactions: may increase effects of methotrexate, valproic acid, and warfarin which may lead
to toxicity (protein displacement). Buffered dosage forms may decrease absorption of ketoconazole
and tetracycline. GI bleeds have been reported with concurrent use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine,
paroxetine, sertraline).
A moderate initial febrile phase dosage of 30–50 mg/kg/24 hr PO ÷ QID for Kawasaki disease is
used in Japan and Western Europe because there are no data to suggest this or the higher dosage
regimen is superior.
Therapeutic levels: antipyretic/analgesic: 30–50 mg/L, antiinflammatory: 150–300 mg/L. Tinnitus
may occur at levels of 200–400 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: obtain
trough level just prior to dose following 1–2 days of continuous dosing. Peak levels obtained 2 hr
(for nonsustained release dosage forms) after a dose may be useful for monitoring toxicity. Adjust
dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
For breast-feeding considerations:
High-dose aspirin regimens: use an alternative drug is recommended.
Low-dose (75–162 mg/24 hr) aspirin regimens: avoid breastfeeding for 1–2 hr after a dose.

up to 100 mg/24 hr.
Adult: 25–100 mg/dose PO once daily; max. dose: 100 mg/24 hr
Contraindicated in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. May cause bradycardia,
hypotension, second- or third-degree AV block, dizziness, fatigue, lethargy, and headache.
Use with caution in diabetes and asthma. Wheezing and dyspnea have occurred when daily
dosage exceeds 100 mg/24 hr. Postmarketing evaluation reports a temporal relationship for
causing elevated LFTs and/or bilirubin, hallucinations, psoriatic rash, thrombocytopenia, visual
disturbances, and dry mouth. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of the drug. Does not cross the blood-brain
barrier; lower incidence of CNS side effects compared with propranolol. Neonates born to mothers
receiving atenolol during labor or while breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia.
Use with disopyramide, amiodarone or digoxin may enhance bradycardic effects. Adjust dose in renal
impairment (see Chapter 31).

ATOMOXETINE
Strattera
Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, ADHD agent

Contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, pheochromocytoma, and severe
cardiac disorders. Do not administer with or within 2 wk after discontinuing an MAO
inhibitor; fatal reactions have been reported. Use with caution in hypertension,
tachycardia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, or with concurrent albuterol
therapy. Increased risk of suicidal thinking has been reported; closely monitor for clinical
worsening, agitation, aggressive behavior, irritability, suicidal thinking or behaviors, and
unusual changes in behavior when initiating (first few months) or at times of dose
changes (increases or decreases). Atomoxetine is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate; poor 2D6
metabolizers compared with normal has been reported to have higher rates of adverse
effects (insomnia, weight loss, constipation, depression, tremor, and excoriation), greater
improvement of ADHD symptoms with lower final dose requirements. Alopecia and
hyperhidrosis have been reported.
Doses >1.2 mg/kg/24 hr in patients ≤70 kg have not been shown to be of additional benefit. Reduce
dose (initial and target doses) by 50% and 75% for patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B)
and severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic insufficiency, respectively.
Major side effects include GI discomfort, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, dizziness, and mood swings.
Hypersensitivity reactions, aggression, irritability, priapism, allergic reactions, and severe liver
injury have also been reported. Consider interrupting therapy in patients who are not growing or
gaining weight satisfactorily.
Doses may be administered with or without food. Atomoxetine can be discontinued without tapering.

Contraindicated in glaucoma, obstructive uropathy, tachycardia, and thyrotoxicosis, except for
severe or life-threatening muscarinic symptoms. Use with caution in patients sensitive to sulfites.
Use in neonatal bradycardia is no longer recommended. Data suggest the use of a minimum 0.1-mg
dose may not be warranted for the preintubation indication. Use of the minimum 0.1-mg dose
could result in an overdose in younger patients.
Side effects include: dry mouth, blurred vision, fever, tachycardia, constipation, urinary retention,
CNS signs (dizziness, hallucinations, restlessness, fatigue, headache).
In case of bradycardia, may give via endotracheal tube at 0.04–0.06 mg/kg (dilute with NS to volume
of 1–2 mL and follow each dose with 1 mL NS). Use injectable solution for nebulized use; can
be mixed with albuterol for simultaneous administration. AtroPen dosage form is designed of IM
administration to the outer thigh.

Increased risk for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in adolescents and young
adults. Toxicity: bone marrow suppression, rash, stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, alopecia,
arthralgias, and GI disturbances.
Use 1⁄4–1⁄3 dose when given with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol). Patients with low
or absent thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) may be
at increased risk for severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity. Consider alternative therapy in
patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with heterozygous deficiency. Individuals with the low functioning alleles for NUDT15 are common among
Asian ancestry and Hispanic ethnicity.
Severe anemia has been reported when used in combination with captopril or enalapril. Monitor
CBC, platelets, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, and creatinine. Pancytopenia and bone

No longer recommended for otitis media due to increased resistant pathogens.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to macrolides and history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic
dysfunction associated with prior use. Use with caution in impaired hepatic function, GFR <10 mL/min
(limited data), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, prolonged QT intervals, and
receiving medications that can cause the aforementioned conditions of caution. May cause increase in
hepatic enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, GI discomfort, and pain at injection site (IV use). Compared with
other macrolides, less risk for drug interactions. Nelfinavir may increase azithromycin levels; monitor for
liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment. Vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea have been reported
at higher frequency in otitis media with 1-day dosing regimen. Exacerbations of myasthenia gravis/
syndrome, serious skin reactions (e.g., SJS and TEN), infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, decreased
lymphocytes, and elevated bilirubin, BUN, and creatinine have been reported. CNS penetration is poor.
Aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids decrease absorption. Tablet and oral suspension
dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-release oral suspension should
be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hr before or 2 hr following a meal). Intravenous administration is over 1–3 hr; do not give as a bolus or IM injection.

AZTREONAM continued

Typically indicated in multidrug resistant aerobic gram-negative infections when β-lactam
therapy is contraindicated. Well-absorbed IM. Use with caution in arginase deficiency. Low
cross-allergenicity between aztreonam and other β-lactams. Adverse reactions: thrombophlebitis,
eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hypotension,
seizures, and confusion. Good CNS penetration. Probenecid and furosemide increase aztreonam
levels. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
INHALATIONAL USE: Cough, nasal congestion, wheezing, pharyngolaryngeal pain, pyrexia, chest
discomfort, abdominal pain, and vomiting may occur. Bronchospasm has been reported. Use the
following order of administration: bronchodilator first, chest physiotherapy, other inhaled medications (if indicated), and aztreonam last.

Intrathecal continuous infusion maintenance therapy (not well established):
<12 yr: average dose of 274 mCg/24 hr (range: 24–1199 mCg/24 hr) has been reported.
≥12 yr and adult: most required 300–800 mCg/24 hr (range: 12–2003 mCg/24 hr with limited
experience at doses >1000 mCg/24 hr)
Avoid abrupt withdrawal of drug. Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder or
impaired renal function. Approximately 70%–80% of the drug is excreted in the urine
unchanged. Administer oral doses with food or milk.
Adverse effects: Drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vertigo, psychiatric disturbances, rash, urinary
frequency, and hypotonia. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of intrathecal therapy to prevent potential lifethreatening events (rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure, and death).
Cases of intrathecal mass at the tip of the implanted catheter leading to withdrawal symptoms have
been reported. Inadvertent subcutaneous injection may occur with improper access of the reservoir
refill septum and may result in an overdose. Sterile techniques must be used with intrathecal use
accounting for all nonsterile external surfaces.
Usual maintenance oral dosage range observed from a collection of smaller prospective and retrospective studies suggest following (see dosage section for initial dose titration):
<2 yr: 10–20 mg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr to a maximum of 40 mg/24 hr
2–7 yr: 20–40 mg/24 hr ÷ Q8 hr to a maximum of 60 mg/24 hr

Recent pediatric phase 3 comparison trial with oseltamivir (MINISONE-2) showed comparable
efficacy and baloxavir was well tolerated. Influenza prophylaxis use and human pregnancy
information are currently not available.
Adverse effects reported in clinical trials include diarrhea, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, headache,
and nausea.
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active baloxavir following oral administration. No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetics differences with moderate hepatic impairment
(Child-Pugh class B) or with creatinine clearances ≥50 mL/min. Pharmacokinetics have not been
evaluated in severe hepatic and/or severe renal impairment.
Primarily metabolized by UGT1A3 with minor contribution from CYP3A4. May reduce the efficacy of
intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine.
Dose may be administered with or without food. Avoid coadministration with dairy products, calcium,
aluminum, magnesium, multivitamins with minerals, iron, selenium, or zinc, because decreased
absorption of baloxavir may occur.

Use with caution in hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and history of allergic
reactions to corticosteroids. See Chapter 8 for relative steroid potencies and doses based
on body surface area. Betamethasone is inadequate when used alone for adrenocortical
insufficiency because its minimal mineralocorticoid properties. Like all steroids, may cause
hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, acne, Cushing syndrome, adrenal axis suppression, GI
bleeding, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis.
Betamethasone is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4, and use with a strong inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole
and itraconazole) may lead to increased exposure and side effects of betamethasone.
Na phosphate and acetate injectable suspension recommended for IM, intra-articular, intrasynovial

where prescribers and pharmacies need to be certified. See www.tracleerrems.com or call
1-866-228-3546 for more information.
Baseline and monthly monitoring of serum aminotransferases and bilirubin; and pregnancy tests for
females of reproductive potential (two forms of birth control required) are required. Use should be
avoided in patients with preexisting hepatic impairment (baseline aminotransferases >3 times the
usual normal limit).
May cause respiratory tract infections, anemia (dose related), edema, increased liver aminotransferases (see dosage modification; higher incidence in adults) and pyrexia. Decreased

Reduce maintenance dose to as low as possible to control symptoms. May cause pharyngitis,
cough, epistaxis, nasal irritation, and HPA-axis suppression. Rinse mouth after each use
via the oral inhalation route. Nebulized budesonide has been shown effective in mild to moderate
croup at doses of 2 mg × 1. Ref: N Engl J Med 331(5):285.
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with the inhaled route.
Anaphylactic reactions, rectal bleeding, peripheral edema, mood swings, increased blood
pressure, rash, and benign intracranial hypertension have been reported with oral route of
administration.
Safety and effectiveness for mild/moderate Crohn disease have been established for children
8–17 yr old weighing ≥25 kg. Safety and efficacy have NOT been established in pediatric patients
for the maintenance of clinical remission of mild/moderate Crohn disease. Although the reported
safety profile in pediatric Crohn disease is consistent with adults, there may be increased risk for
decreased growth velocity due to higher systemic absorption of corticosteroids in children with
Crohn disease.
CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, protease inhibitors) or significant hepatic
impairment may increase systemic exposure of budesonide (inhalation and PO routes).
Onset of action for oral inhalation and nebulized suspension is within 1 day and 2–8 days, respectively, with peak effects at 1–2 wk and 4–6 wk, respectively.

Nasal inhalation:
≥6 to <12 yr: Start at 1 spray in each nostril once daily. If needed, increase to 2 sprays each nostril
once daily. Then reduce dose back to initial dose when symptoms improve. Max. nasal dose:
128 mCg/24 hr (4 sprays/24 hr).
≥12 yr to adult: Start at 2 sprays in each nostril once daily. When symptoms improve, reduce dose
to 1 spray each nostril once daily. Usual max. dose is 128 mCg/24 hr (4 sprays/24 hr) but some
may require 256 mCg/24 hr (8 sprays/24 hr) initially with a subsequent reduced dosage to improve
symptoms.
Crohn disease (Encort EC and generics):
Child ≥6 yr (see remarks): Data are limited; only the following dosages have been reported.
Additional studies are needed.
Active disease: 9 mg PO once daily × 7–8 wk
Maintenance of remission: 6 mg PO once daily × 3–4 wk
In addition, a report in 10–19 yr old children demonstrated higher remission rates with an induction dose of 12 mg PO once daily × 4 wk, followed by 9 mg PO once daily × 3 wk, followed by
6 mg PO once daily × 3 wk.
Adult:
Active disease: 9 mg PO QAM × 8 wk; if remission is not achieved, a second 8-wk course may be
given.
Maintenance of remission: 6 mg PO once daily for up to 3 mo. If symptom control is maintained
at 3 mo, taper dosage to compete cessation. Remission therapy beyond 3 mo has not shown to
provide substantial clinical benefit.
Ulcerative colitis, induction of remission (Uceris and generics):
Adult:
Extended release oral tablet: 9 mg PO QAM for up to 8 wk
Rectal foam: 2 mg PR BID × 2 wk followed by 2 mg PR once daily × 4 wk

See Budesonide and Formoterol for remarks. Should only be used for patients not adequately
controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low-to-medium dose inhaled
corticosteroids) or whose disease severity requires the use of two maintenance therapies.
Titrate to the lowest effective strength after asthma is adequately controlled.
Reported side effects at ≥3% and more frequently compared with budesonide alone include URI,
pharyngitis, headache, and rhinitis.
As needed rescue therapy with budesonide/formoterol was found to be noninferior to maintenance
budesonide and PRN terbutaline for controlling symptoms in mild asthmatics ≥12 yr old (Ref.
N Engl J Med 378[20]:1877).
Proper patient education including dosage administration technique is essential; see patient package

Epidiolex is a schedule V controlled substance. Common side effects include somnolence,
decreased appetite, diarrhea, elevated transaminase (dose related), fatigue, malaise and
asthenia, rash, insomnia, and sleep disorder. Suicidal behavior and ideation and
respiratory failure have been reported.
Monitor ALT, AST, and total bilirubin at baseline and 1, 3, 6 mo initially and periodically thereafter.
More frequent monitoring is recommended with concurrent valproic acid or clobazam. Reduce dose
or discontinue use in the presence of hepatic impairment.
Epidiolex is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4; other moderate/strong inducers or inhibitors for
these enzymes may affect its overall exposure. May increase the effects/toxicity of clobazam and
diazepam because it may inhibit CYP 450 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19. May inhibit the UGT 1A9
and 2B7 transporters.
Teratogen data limited only to animal studies with evidence of developmental toxicities at similar
exposure concentrations in humans receiving therapeutic doses. Patients exposed to cannabidiol
during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy
Registry at www.aedpregnancyregistry.org.
Administration with high-fat or high-calorie meals may increase absorption. Gradually taper when
discontinuing medication; avoid abrupt discontinuation.
Each bottle of oral solution must be stored in the original bottle in the upright position at 59–86°F.

CAPTOPRIL continued

Onset within 15–30 min of administration. Peak effect within 1–2 hr. Adjust dose with renal
failure (see Chapter 31). Should be administered on an empty stomach 1 hr before or 2
hr after meals. Titrate to minimal effective dose. Lower doses should be used in patients
with sodium and water depletion because of diuretic therapy.
Use with caution in collagen vascular disease and concomitant potassium sparing diuretics. Avoid
use with dialysis with high-flux membranes as anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. May
cause rash, proteinuria, neutropenia, cough, angioedema (head, neck and intestine), hyperkalemia,
hypotension, or diminution of taste perception (with long term use). Known to decrease aldosterone
and increase renin production. Do not coadminister with angiotensin receptor blockers or aliskiren
as use has been associated with increased risks for hypotension, hyperkalemia, and acute renal
failure. Captopril is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate. Use with sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus, or
sacubitril may increase risk for angioedema.

Intravenous dosage form (Carnexiv; see remarks) cont.:
Adult (IV; indicated as replacement therapy for PO carbamazepine when PO route is not feasible):
Determine IV daily dose by taking 70% of the established total daily oral dosage and dividing into
4 equal doses to be administered Q6 hr. Each dose is further diluted in 100 mL of compatible fluid
and infused over 30 min. Use is NOT recommended >7 days.
Contraindicated for patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or who are sensitive to
tricyclic antidepressants. Should not be used in combination with clozapine, owing to increased
risk for bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis. Increased risk for severe dermatologic
reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN]) has been
associated with the HLA-B*1502 (prevalent among Asian descent) and HLA-A*3101 (prevalent
among Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian, and some Arabic ancestry) alleles.
Erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, cefixime, cimetidine, itraconazole, aprepitant, and INH may increase
serum levels. Carbamazepine may decrease activity of warfarin, direct-acting oral anticoagulants
(e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban), doxycycline, oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, theophylline, phenytoin,
benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and valproic acid. Carbamazepine is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and
inducer of CYP 450 1A2, 2C, and 3A3/4. The enzyme-inducing effects may increase effects/toxicity of
cyclophosphamide. CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase carbamazepine levels/toxicity.
Suggested dosing intervals for specific dosage forms: extended-release tabs or caps (BID); chewable
and immediate-release tablets (BID–TID); suspension (QID).
Doses may be administered with food. Do not crush or chew extended-release dosage forms. Shake
bottle well prior to dispensing oral suspension dosage form, and do not administer simultaneously
with other liquid medicines or diluents.
Drug metabolism typically increases after the first month of therapy initiation due to hepatic
autoinduction.
Therapeutic blood levels for seizures: 4–12 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time: obtain trough
level within 30 min prior to an oral dose. Steady state is typically achieved 1 mo following the initiation of therapy (following enzymatic autoinduction). Levels obtained prior to steady state are useful for
preventing toxicity. Blood trough levels of 7–10 mg/L have been recommended for bipolar disorders.
Side effects include sedation, dizziness, diplopia, aplastic anemia, neutropenia, urinary retention,
nausea, SIADH, and SJS. Suicidal behavior or ideation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and onychomadesis have been reported. Approximately one-third of patients who had hypersensitivity reactions will
also experience the hypersensitivity to oxcarbazepine. Pretreatment complete blood counts (CBCs)
and liver function tests (LFTs) are suggested. Patient should be monitored for hematologic and
hepatic toxicity. Most common side effects with the IV route, dizziness, somnolence, blurred vision,
diplopia, headache, infusion-related reaction, infusion site pain, and anemia.
Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31). Do not use IV dosage form in moderate/severe
renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min) due to accumulation of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium,
which may be nephrotoxic.

Use with caution in penicillin-allergic patients or in presence of renal impairment. Good
gram-positive cocci activity but may be inadequate for penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
May cause diarrhea (especially in children <2 yr), headache, vaginitis, and false-positive
urine-reducing substance (Clinitest) and Coombs test. Eosinophilia and abnormal LFTs
have been reported with higher than usual doses.
Once-daily dosing has not been evaluated in pneumonia and skin infections. Probenecid increases
serum cefdinir levels. Avoid concomitant administration with iron and iron-containing vitamins
and antacids containing aluminum or magnesium (space 2 hr apart) to reduce the risk for
decreasing antibiotic’s absorption. May cause red stools when administered with iron and ironcontaining products. Doses may be taken without regard to food. Adjust dose in renal failure

Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for dental and upper respiratory procedures:
Infant and child: 50 mg/kg IV/IM (max. dose: 1 g) 30 min before procedure
Adult: 1 g IV/IM 30 min before procedure
Contraindicated in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. Do not administer with IV calciumcontaining solutions or products (mixed or administered simultaneously via different lines)
in neonates (<28 days old) because of risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium salt.
Cases of fatal reactions with calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in lung and kidneys in
preterm and full-term neonates have been reported. Do not administer simultaneously with
IV calcium-containing solutions via a Y-site for any age group. IV calcium-containing
products may be administered sequentially only when the infusion lines are thoroughly
flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid.
Use with caution in penicillin allergy; patients with gallbladder, biliary tract, liver, or pancreatic disease;
presence of renal impairment; or in neonates with continuous dosing (risk for hyperbilirubinemia). In
neonates, consider using an alternative third-generation cephalosporin with similar activity. Unlike
other cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is significantly cleared by the biliary route (35%–45%).
Rash, injection site pain, diarrhea, and transient increase in liver enzymes are common. May cause reversible
cholelithiasis, sludging in gallbladder, and jaundice. May interfere with serum and urine creatinine assays
(Jaffe method) and cause false-positive urinary protein and urinary reducing substances (Clinitest).
For IM injections, dilute drug with either sterile water for injection or 1% lidocaine to a concentration of 250 or 350 mg/mL (250 mg/mL has lower incidence of injection site reactions). Assess
the potential risk/benefit for using lidocaine as a diluent; see Lidocaine for additional remarks
especially risk for methemoglobinemia.

Capsules: 50, 100, 200, 400 mg

Contraindicated for perioperative pain with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Use
with caution in patients with systemic-onset JRA due to risk for serious adverse reactions
(e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation). In adults, serious cardiovascular and GI risks
reported include thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, GI bleed, GI ulceration, and GI
perforation. Common adverse effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertension.
TEN, SJS, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia have also been reported.
Celecoxib is a substrate of CYP 450 2C9. Poor metabolizers of 2C9 should start with half the lowest
recommended dose and use with caution, or consider alternative therapy. Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, loop diuretics, and sodium phosphates may increase risk for renal
dysfunction. Oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, SSRIs, smoking,
alcohol use, older age, and poor health status may increase risk for GI bleeds with prolonged treatment courses. Celecoxib may reduce the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors and increase the
levels/toxicity of lithium, metoprolol, and methotrexate.
Not recommended for use in severe renal dysfunction and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh
Class C). Reduce dose by 50% and monitor patient closely in moderate hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B).
Pregnancy category is “C” for prior to 30 wk’s gestation and “D” for 30 wk and greater.

Generally not recommended for treating URIs for infants. No proven benefit for infants and
young children with URIs. The FDA does not recommend use for URIs in children <2 yr
because of reports of increased fatalities.
May cause headache, pharyngitis, GI symptoms, dry mouth, and sedation. Aggressive reactions and
convulsions have been reported. Has NOT been implicated in causing cardiac arrhythmias when
used with other drugs that are metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole,
erythromycin).
In hepatic impairment, the following doses have been recommended:
Cetirizine:
<6 yr: Use not recommended
6–11 yr: <2.5 mg PO once daily
≥12 yr–adult: 5 mg PO once daily
Cetirizine in combination with pseudoephedrine:
≥12 yr–adult: 1 tablet PO once daily
Doses may be administered regardless to food. For Zyrtec-D 12 Hr, see Pseudoephedrine for additional
remarks. Pregnancy category is “B” for cetirizine and “C” when combined with pseudoephedrine.
Dosage adjustment is recommended in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).
OPHTHALMIC USE: Common side effects include application site pain, ocular hyperemia, and reduced
visual acuity. Oculogyric crisis has been reported. Do not touch dropper tip to anything, and remove

Max. dose (all ages): 4 g/24 hr
Dose recommendations are just guidelines for therapy; monitoring of blood levels is essential.
Follow hematologic status for dose-related or idiosyncratic marrow suppression. “Gray
baby” syndrome may be seen with levels >50 mg/L. Use with caution in G6PD deficiency,
renal or hepatic dysfunction, and neonates.
Concomitant use of phenobarbital and rifampin may lower chloramphenicol serum levels. Phenytoin
may increase chloramphenicol serum levels. Chloramphenicol may increase the effects/toxicity
of phenytoin, chlorpropamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and oral anticoagulants and decrease
absorption of vitamin B12. Chloramphenicol is an inhibitor of CYP 450 2C9.
Therapeutic levels: Peak: 15–25 mg/L for meningitis and 10–20 mg/L for other infections. Trough:
5–15 mg/L for meningitis and 5–10 mg/L for other infections. Recommended serum sampling
time: trough within 30 min prior to next dose; peak 30 min after the end of infusion. Time to
achieve steady state: 2–3 days for newborns; 12–24 hr for children and adults.

Adult: 600 mg/dose PO × 1; followed by 300 mg/dose 6, 24, and 48 hr after the initial dose.
Contraindicated in the presence of retinal or visual field changes and known hypersensitivity
to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. Use with caution in liver disease, preexisting auditory
damage or seizures, G6PD deficiency, psoriasis, porphyria, or concomitant hepatotoxic
drugs. May cause nausea, vomiting, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, prolonged QT
interval, blurred vision, retinal and corneal changes (reversible corneal opacities),
headaches, confusion, skeletal muscle weakness, increased liver enzymes, and hair
depigmentation. SJS, TEN, anaphylactic reactions, and maculopathy and macular
degeneration have been reported. False-positive test for urine amphetamine screen may
occur.
Antacids, ampicillin, and kaolin may decrease the absorption of chloroquine (allow 4-hr interval
between these drugs and chloroquine). Cimetidine may increase effects/toxicity of chloroquine. May
increase serum cyclosporine levels. Coadministration with mefloquine may increase risk of convulsions. May reduce the antibody response to intradermal human diploid-cell rabies vaccine.
Monitor CBCs periodically with therapies of prolonged duration. Adjust dose in renal failure (see
Chapter 31).

Biologic potency and oral absorption may be greater than ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).
Requires activation by the liver (25-hydroxylation) and kidney (1-hydroxylation) to the
active form, calcitriol. Recommended time period to recheck serum 25-OH vitamin D is 3
mo after initiation or change in dosage.
Monitor serum Ca2+, PO4, 25-0H vitamin D (goal level for infant and child: ≥20 ng/mL) and alkaline
phosphate. Serum Ca2+, PO4 product should be <70 mg/dL to avoid ectopic calcification. Serum
25-OH vitamin D level of ≥35 ng/mL has been used in cystic fibrosis patients to decrease the risk
of hyperparathyroidism and bone loss.
Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels ≥100 ng/mL is considered toxic. Toxic effects in infants may result
in nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, polydipsia, polyuria, muscle
weakness, muscle/joint pain, confusion, and fatigue; renal damage may also occur.
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in doses above the U.S. RDA.

Ciclesonide is a prodrug hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, des-ciclesonide via esterases in
nasal mucosa and lungs; further metabolism via hepatic CYP3A4 and 2D6. Concurrent use
with ketoconazole and other CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors may increase systemic des-ciclesonide
levels. Use with caution and monitor in hepatic impairment.
Oral inhalation (asthma): Rinse mouth after each use. May cause headache, arthralgia, nasal
congestion, nasopharyngitis, and URIs. Routinely monitor growth of pediatric patients. Maximum
therapeutic benefit may not be achieved until 4 wk after initiation; consider dose increase if
response is inadequate after 4 wk after initial dosage.
Intranasal (allergic rhinitis): Clear nasal passages prior to use. May cause otalgia, epistaxis,
nasopharyngitis, and headache. Nasal septal perforation has been reported. Patients should be
free of nasal disease, except for allergic rhinitis, before starting therapy. Monitor linear growth of
pediatric patients routinely. Onset of action: 24–48 hr; further improvement observed over 1–2 wk

Systemic fluoroquinolones are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side
effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.
Can cause GI upset, renal failure, and seizures. GI symptoms, headache, restlessness, and rash are
common side effects. Peripheral neuropathy, pseudotumor cerebri, severe hepatic necrosis, and
psychiatric reactions have been reported. Use with caution in children <18 yr (like other quinolones, tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy, especially with concomitant corticosteroid
use), alkalinized urine (crystalluria), seizures, excessive sunlight (photosensitivity), and renal
dysfunction (adjust systemic dose in renal failure; see Chapter 31). Blood glucose disturbances
(hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) have been reported in diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral
hypoglycemic agent.
Do not use otic suspension with perforated tympanic membranes and with viral infections of the
external ear canal.
For dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = ideal body weight + 0.45
(total body weight − ideal body weight).
Combinational antimicrobial therapy is recommended for anthrax. For penicillin-susceptible strains,
consider changing to high-dose amoxicillin (25–35 mg/kg/dose TID PO). See www.bt.cdc.gov for
the latest information.
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2. Ciprofloxacin can increase effects and/or toxicity of caffeine, methotrexate,
theophylline, warfarin, tizanidine (excessive sedation and dangerous hypotension), and cyclosporine. Probenecid increases ciprofloxacin levels.
Do not administer antacids or other divalent salts with or within 2–4 hr of oral ciprofloxacin dose.
Do not administer oral suspension through feeding tubes, because this dosage form adheres to
the tube.

Seizures (generalized or partial, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy; limited data and
prescribing information from Canada and the United Kingdom):
Infant and child (<2 yr): Start at 0.5–1 mg/kg/24 hr (max. dose: 5 mg/24 hr) PO ÷ BID, if needed
and tolerated, slowly increase dosage at 5–7 days intervals up to the maximum of 10 mg/kg/24 hr.
2–16 yr: Start at 5 mg PO once daily, if needed and tolerated, slowly increase dosage at 5–7 day
intervals up to the maximum of 40 mg/kg/24 hr. Usual dosage range: 10–20 mg/24 hr or 0.3–1
mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID.
Use with caution in hepatic impairment (dose adjustment may be needed). Do not
discontinue use abruptly, as seizures/withdrawal symptoms may occur. Common side
effects include constipation, drooling, ataxia, drowsiness, insomnia, aggressive behavior,
cough, and fever. SJS, TEN, urinary retention, hypothermia, leukopenia, and
thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Do not use in combination with azelastine, olanzapine, sodium oxybate, and thioridazine; increased
risk of adverse events. Proton pump inhibitors, azole antifungal agents (e.g., itraconazole and
ketoconazole), St. John’s Wort, grapefruit juice, CNS depressants, cimetidine, and calcium channel
blockers may increase the effects/toxicity of clobazam. Use with opioids may result in profound
sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and mortality. Carbamazepine, rifamycin derivatives (e.g.,
rifampin), and theophylline may decrease the effects of clobazam. Clobazam is a major substrate
for CYP 450 2C19 and P-glycoprotein, minor substrate for CYP 450 2B6 and 3A4, inhibitor of CYP
450 2D6, and inducer of CYP 3A4. Carefully review the patient’s medication profile for other drug
interactions each time clobazam is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing
clobazam.
Doses may be taken with or without food. Tablets may be crushed and mixed with applesauce.
Oral film (Sympazan) uses same PO dosage with the following method for administration: apply film
on top of the tongue, allow it to dissolve, and swallow saliva in a normal manner. Do not chew,
spit, or talk while film is dissolving. Doses may be taken with or without food but do not administer
with liquids.

Side effects: Dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, anorexia, arrhythmias,
and local skin reactions with patch. Somnolence, fatigue, URIs irritability, throat pain,
insomnia, nightmares, and emotional disorder were reported as common side effects in
ADHD clinical trials. May worsen sinus node dysfunction and AV block especially for
patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Do not abruptly discontinue; signs of
sympathetic overactivity may occur; taper gradually over >1 wk.
β-blockers may exacerbate rebound hypertension during and following the withdrawal of clonidine. If
patient is receiving both clonidine and a β-blocker and clonidine is to be discontinued, the β-blocker
should be withdrawn several days prior to tapering the clonidine. If converting from clonidine over to
a β-blocker, introduce the β-blocker several days after discontinuing clonidine (after taper).
Monitor heart rate when used with digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and β-blockers. Use with diltiazem or verapamil may result in sinus bradycardia. Use with neuroleptics may induce/exacerbate
orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and fatigue. Consider using lower dosages in renal impairment
because the drug is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine and signs of bradycardia, sedation, and hypotension may occur.
T½: 44–72 hr (neonate), 6–20 hr (adult). Onset of action (antihypertensive): 0.5–1 hr for oral route,
2–3 days for transdermal route. Do not use transdermal route while patient is undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure; transdermal patches contains metals and may result in
serious patient burns when undergoing MRI.

May increase bosentan, dabigatran, methotrexate, repaglinide, and anthracycline antibiotics (e.g.,
doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) levels/effects/toxicity. Use with nifedipine may result in
gingival hyperplasia. Cyclosporine is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein.
Children may require dosages 2–3 times higher than adults. Plasma half-life 6–24 hr.
Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after
3–5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay
methodology (RIA monoclonal vs. RIA polyclonal vs. HPLC), as well as whole blood vs. serum
sample. Additional monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary in renal and hepatic
impairment or when changing dosage forms.
For ophthalmic use: Ocular burning may occur. Remove contact lens prior to use; lens may be inserted

Contraindicated in uncontrolled hypertension and patients hypersensitive to albumin/
polysorbate 80 or epoetin alfa. Darbepoetin alfa is not intended for patients requiring acute
correction of anemia. Use with caution in seizures and liver disease. Erythema multiforme,
SJS, and TEN have been reported. Evaluate serum iron, feritin, and TIBC; concurrent iron
supplementation may be necessary. Red cell aplasia and severe anemia associated with
neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported.
USE IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Higher doses may be needed for pediatric patients being switched
from epoetin alfa than those for naïve patients. May cause edema, fatigue, GI disturbances, headache, blood pressure changes, fever, cardiac arrhythmia/arrest, infections and myalgia. Higher risk
for mortality and serious cardiovascular events have been reported with higher targeted hemoglobin
levels (>11 g/dL). If hemoglobin levels do not increase or reach targeted levels despite appropriate
dose titrations over a 12 wk period, (1) do not administer higher doses and use the lowest dose that

symptoms were seen in adults after discontinuing therapy lasting <6 hr in duration.
Hypotension and bradycardia are common side effects; may be more pronounced in hypovolemia,
diabetes or chronic hypertension. Transient hypertension has been observed during loading doses. QT
prolongation, hypernatremia, sinus arrest, and polyuria have been reported. Do not abruptly withdraw
therapy, as withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and agitation) are possible; taper the dose

DEXMETHYLPHENIDATE: Use the equivalent mg dosage amount.
Dexmethylphenidate is the d-enantiomer of methylphenidate and accounts for the majority of
clinical effects for methylphenidate. Contraindicated in glaucoma, anxiety disorders, motor
tics, and Tourette syndrome. Do not use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor;
hypertensive crisis may occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of MAO inhibitor. See
methylphendate for additional warnings and drug interactions.

Use with caution in presence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal or hepatic
impairment (drug elimination may be decreased). Avoid use in known serious structural
cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery
disease, or other serious cardiac problems that may increase risk of sympathomimetic
effects of amphetamines (sudden death, stroke, and MI have been reported). Do not give
with MAO inhibitors (also within 14 days of discontinuance) or general anesthetics. Use with
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce the effectiveness of either dextroamphetamine or
the combination with amphetamine.
DEXTROAMPHETAMINE AND AMPHETAMINE: Serotonin syndrome may occur when used with serotonergic neurotransmitter medications such as MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, and TCAs. CYP 450 2D6 inhibitors may increase the effects/
toxicity of the combination medication.
Not recommended for <3 yr. Medication should generally not be used in children <5 yr old, as diagnosis of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in this age group is extremely difficult
(use in consultation with a specialist). Interrupt administration occasionally to determine need for
continued therapy. Many side effects, including insomnia (avoid dose administration within 6 hr of
bedtime), restlessness/irritability, anorexia, psychosis, visual disturbances, headache, vomiting,
abdominal cramps, dry mouth, and growth failure. Paranoia, mania, peripheral vasculopathy
(including Raynaud phenomenon), priapism, bruxism, and auditory hallucination have been
reported. Assess for risk of abuse and dependence prior to prescribing. Tolerance develops. Same
guidelines as for methylphenidate apply. See Amphetamine for amphetamine-containing products.

with caution in hepatic and renal dysfunction, glaucoma, shock, and depression. Do not
use in combination with protease inhibitors. Concurrent use with CNS depressants,
cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and valproic acid may enhance the effects of
diazepam. Use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma
and mortality. Diazepam is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A5-7, and minor
substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 2C19 and 3A3/4. The active desmethyldiazepam
metabolite is a CYP 450 2C19 substrate.
Administer the conventional IV product undiluted no faster than 2 mg/min and do not mix with
IV fluids.
In status epilepticus, diazepam must be followed by long-acting anticonvulsants. Onset of

Hypoglycemia should be treated initially with IV glucose; diazoxide should be introduced only
if refractory to glucose infusion. Should not be used in patients hypersensitive to thiazides
unless benefit outweighs risk. Thiazides may enhance diazoxide’s hyperglycemic effects.
Use with caution in renal impairment (clearance of drug is reduced); consider dosage
reduction.
Sodium and fluid retention is common in young infants and adults and may precipitate congestive
heart failure (CHF) in patients with compromised cardiac reserve (usually responsive to diuretics). Hirsutism (reversible), GI disturbances, transient loss of taste, tachycardia, ketoacidosis,
palpitations, rash, headache, weakness, and hyperuricemia may occur. Pulmonary hypertension
in newborns/infant treated for hypoglycemia has been reported as resolution/improvement of the
condition was achieved after discontinuance of diazoxide. Monitor BP closely for hypotension.
Hyperglycemic effect with PO administration occurs within 1 hr, with a duration of 8 hr.

Contraindicated in patients with ventricular dysrhythmias. Use should be avoided in
patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. Use with caution in renal failure,
with calcium channel blockers (may result in heart block), and with adenosine (enhanced
depressant effects on sinoatrial [SA] and atrioventricular [AV] nodes). May cause AV block
or dysrhythmias. In patients treated with digoxin, cardioversion, or calcium infusion, may
lead to ventricular fibrillation (pretreatment with lidocaine may prevent this). Patients with
beri beri heart disease may not respond to digoxin if underlying thiamine deficiency is not
treated concomitantly. Decreased serum potassium and magnesium, or increased
magnesium and calcium may increase risk for digoxin toxicity. For signs and symptoms of
toxicity, see Chapter 3.
Excreted via the kidney; adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Therapeutic concentration:
0.8–2 ng/mL. Higher doses may be required for supraventricular tachycardia. Neonates, pregnant
women, and patients with renal, hepatic, or heart failure may have falsely elevated digoxin levels,
due to the presence of digoxin-like substances.
Digoxin is a CYP450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate. Calcium channel blockers, captopril,
carvedilol, amiodarone, quinidine, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tetracycline, and macrolide
antibiotics may increase digoxin levels. Use with β-blockers and ivabradine may increase risk for
bradycardia. Succinylcholine may cause arrhythmias in digitalized patients.
T1/2: Premature infants, 61–170 hr; full-term neonates, 35–45 hr; infants, 18–25 hr; and children,
35 hr.
Recommended serum sampling at steady state: Obtain a single level from 6 hr postdose to just
before the next scheduled dose following 5–8 days of continuous dosing. Levels obtained prior to
steady state may be useful in preventing toxicity.

Serum Digoxin Concentration (ng/mL)

aUse 1 mg/mL DigiFab concentration for dose accuracy

Dosage Administration:
Reconstitute each vial with 4 mL NS for a 10 mg/mL concentration and infuse IV dose over 30 min.
If an infusion rate reaction occurs, stop infusion and restart at a slower rate. In situations of
cardiac arrest, DigiFab can be administered as a bolus injection, but expect an increased risk
for infusion-related reactions. For smaller doses, vials may be reconstituted with 36 mL NS for
a 1 mg/mL concentration.
Contraindicated if hypersensitive to sheep products. Use with caution in renal or cardiac
failure. May cause rapidly developing severe hypokalemia, decreased cardiac output (from
withdrawal of digoxin’s inotropic effects), rash, edema, and phlebitis. Digoxin therapy may
be reinstituted in 3–7 days, when toxicity has been corrected. Digoxin-immune FAB will
interfere with digitalis immunoassay measurements to result in misleading concentrations.

Contraindicated in idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS). Tachycardia,
arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]), and hypertension may
occasionally occur (especially at higher infusion rates). Correct hypovolemic states before
use. Increases AV conduction, and may precipitate ventricular ectopic activity.
Dobutamine has been shown to increase cardiac output and systemic pressure in pediatric patients
of every age group. However, in premature neonates, dobutamine is less effective than dopamine in
raising systemic blood pressure without causing undue tachycardia, and dobutamine has not been
shown to provide any added benefit when given to such infants already receiving optimal infusions
of dopamine.
Monitor BP and vital signs. T1/2: 2 min. Peak effects in 10–20 min. Use with linezolid may potentially
increase blood pressure. Use with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (e.g., entacapone) may increase heart rate, arrhythmias, and changes in blood pressure.

DOLASETRON continued

May cause hypotension and prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly QTc
interval (dose-dependent effect). Common side effects include dizziness, headache,
sedation, blurred vision, fever, chills, and sleep disorders. Rare cases of sustained
supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, fatal cardiac arrest, and MI have been
reported in children and adolescents.
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, or with
concurrent use with other drugs that increase QTc interval (e.g., erythromycin, cisapride). Drug’s
active metabolite (hydrodolasetron) is a substrate for CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 isoenzymes;
concomitant use of enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) may increase risk for side effects, and use
of enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease dolasetron’s efficacy. Serotonin syndrome has
been associated with concurrent use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (e.g., duloxetine,
venlafaxine), MAO inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and IV methylene blue.
Although no dosage adjustments are necessary, hydrodolasetron’s clearance decreases 42% with
severe hepatic impairment and 44% with severe renal impairment.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, bradyarrhythmias or
renal impairment.
IV doses may be administered undiluted over 30 sec.

Low dose: 2–5 mCg/kg/min IV; increases renal blood flow; minimal effect on heart rate
and cardiac output
Intermediate dose: 5–15 mCg/kg/min IV; increases heart rate, cardiac contractility,
cardiac output, and to a lesser extent, renal blood flow.
High dose: >15 mCg/kg/min IV; α adrenergic effects are prominent; decreases renal perfusion.
Max. dose recommended: 20–50 mCg/kg/min IV
To prepare infusion: see IV infusions on page i.
Do not use in pheochromocytoma, tachyarrhythmias, or hypovolemia. Monitor vital signs and
blood pressure continuously. Correct hypovolemic states. Tachyarrhythmias, ectopic beats,
hypertension, vasoconstriction, and vomiting may occur. Use with caution with phenytoin
because hypotension and bradycardia may be exacerbated. Use with linezolid may potentially
increase blood pressure.
Newborn infants may be more sensitive to the vasoconstrictive effects of dopamine. Children
<2 yr of age clear dopamine faster, and high variability in neonates is exhibited.
Should be administered through a central line or large vein. Extravasation may cause tissue necrosis;
treat with phentolamine. Do not administer into an umbilical arterial catheter.

Use with caution in hepatic and renal disease. Generally not recommended for use in
children <8 yr due to risk for tooth enamel hypoplasia and discoloration. However, the AAP
Redbook recommends doxycycline as the drug of choice for rickettsial disease regardless of
age and the use in children <8 yr for short treatment courses (≤21 days). May cause GI
symptoms, photosensitivity, hemolytic anemia, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.
Increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), TEN, DRESS, erythema multiforme,
and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported.
Doxycycline is approved for the treatment of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) in combination with one or
two other antimicrobials. If meningitis is suspected, consider using an alternative agent because
of poor CNS penetration. Consider changing to high-dose amoxicillin (25–35 mg/kg/dose TID PO)
for penicillin-susceptible strains. See www.bt.cdc.gov for the latest information.
Rifampin, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may increase clearance of doxycycline.
Doxycycline may enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin. See Tetracycline for additional drug/food interactions and remarks.

ENOXAPARIN continued

­

Inhibits thrombosis by inactivating factor Xa without significantly affecting bleeding time,
platelet function, PT, or aPTT at recommended doses. Dosages of enoxaparin, heparin, or
other LMWHs CANNOT be used interchangeably on a unit-for-unit (or mg-for-mg) basis
because of differences in pharmacokinetics and activity. Peak anti–factor Xa LMWH
activity is achieved 4 hr after a SC dose. Anti–factor Xa LMWH is NOT THE SAME as
unfractionated heparin anti–factor Xa level (used for monitoring heparin therapy).
Contraindicated in major bleeding, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and pork hypersensitivity.
Use with caution in uncontrolled arterial hypertension, bleeding diathesis, history of recurrent GI
ulcers, diabetic retinopathy, and severe renal dysfunction (reduce dose by increasing the dosage
interval from Q12 hr to Q24 hr if GFR <30 mL/min). Prophylactic use is not recommended in
patients with prosthetic heart valves (especially in pregnant women) due to reports of fatalities
in patients and fetuses. Concurrent use with spinal or epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture
has resulted in long-term or permanent paralysis; potential benefits must be weighed against
the risks. May cause fever, confusion, edema, nausea, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia (including
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ± thrombosis [HIT/HITTS]), hypochromic anemia, and pain/
erythema at injection site. Allergic reactions, headache, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and
cholestatic liver injury, and osteoporosis (long-term use) have been reported. Protamine sulfate is
the antidote; 1 mg protamine sulfate neutralizes 1 mg enoxaparin.
DVT prophylaxis for patients with epidural catheters/neuraxial anesthesia: If placing needle, hold
anticoagulation for 12 hr and restart dosing no sooner than 4 hr after needle insertion. If removing
catheter, hold anticoagulation for 12 hr and restart dosing no sooner than 2 hr after catheter
removal.
Recommended anti–factor Xa LMWH levels obtained 4 hr after subcutaneous dose after the third
consecutive dose for children (anti–factor Xa LMWH response in children is highly variable
compared to adults):
DVT treatment: 0.5–1 units/mL
DVT prophylaxis: 0.1–0.3 units/mL
Administer by deep SC injection by having the patient lie down. Alternate administration between the
left and right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall. See package insert for
detailed SC administration recommendations. To minimize bruising, do not rub the injection site.
IM route of administration is not recommended.
For additional information, see Chest 2008;133:887–968 and Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine

EPINEPHRINE HCL continued

High-dose rescue therapy for in-hospital cardiac arrest in children after failure of an initial
standard dose has been reported to be of no benefit compared to standard dose (N Engl J
Med 2004;350:1722–1730).
May produce arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypertension, headaches, nervousness, nausea, vomiting, and
rare cases of stress cardiomyopathy. Necrosis may occur at site of repeated local injection. Rare
cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis, have
been reported with IM or deep SC injections.
Concomitant use of noncardiac selective β-blockers, MAO inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, clonidine, or
tricyclic antidepressants may enhance epinephrine’s pressor response. Chlorpromazine, diuretics,
nitrates, or α-blockers may reverse the pressor response. Do not use products containing chlorobutanol for ophthalmic use, as it may be harmful to the corneal endothelium.
ETT doses should be diluted with NS to a volume of 3–5 mL before administration. Follow with several
positive pressure ventilations.
Hypersensitivity reactions: For bronchial asthma and certain allergic manifestations (e.g., angioedema,
urticaria, serum sickness, anaphylactic shock), use epinephrine SC. Patients with anaphylaxis may benefit from IM administration. The adult IV dose for hypersensitivity reactions or to relieve bronchospasm
usually ranges from 0.1 to 0.25 mg injected slowly over 5–10 min Q5–15 min as needed. Neonates may
be given a dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight; for infants, 0.05 mg is an adequate initial dose, and this
may be repeated at 20- to 30-min intervals in the management of asthma attacks.
Due to the inconsistent availability of autoinjector products, periodic reeducation of available device
may be necessary. See respective autoinjector product for proper dose administration methods
including methods to prevent injury and/or inadvertent dose administration to the individual administering the dose. Accidental injection into the digits, hand, or feet may result in the loss of blood flow
to the affected area. Do not inject into the buttock area.

Anemia in chronic renal failure (see remarks for dosage adjustment and withholding
therapy): SC/IV (IV preferred for hemodialysis patients)
Initial dose:
Child and adolescent: Start at 50 U/kg/dose 3 times per week. Reported dosage range for children
(3 mo–20 yr) not requiring dialysis, 50–250 U/kg/dose 3 times per week. Reported dosage range
for children receiving hemodialysis, 50–450 U/kg/dose 2–3 times per week.
Adult: Start at 50–100 U/kg/dose 3 times per week
Maintenance dose: Dose is individualized to achieve and maintain the lowest Hgb level sufficient to
avoid transfusions and not to exceed 11 g/dL.
Anemia in cancer (use until chemotherapy is completed; see remarks for dosage reduction and
withholding therapy):
Initial dose:
Child (5–18 yr): Start at 600 U/kg (max. dose: 40,000 U) IV once weekly.
Adult: Start at 150 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per week or 40,000 U SC once every week.
Increasing doses (if needed):
Three-times-a-week dosing regimen (adult): If no increase in Hgb >1 g/dL and Hgb remains <10
g/dL after initial 4 wk of therapy, increase dosage to 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per week.
Weekly dosing regimen: If no increase in Hgb >1 g/dL and Hgb remains <10 g/dL after initial 4
wk of therapy:
Child: Increase dose to 900 U/kg/dose IV (max. dose: 60,000 U) once weekly.
Adult: 60,000 U SC once weekly.
For all ages, discontinue use after 8 wk of therapy if transfusions are still required or no hemoglobin
response is observed.
AZT-treated HIV patients (Hgb should not exceed 12 g/dL): SC/IV
Child: Reported dosage range in children (≥3 mo–17 yr), 50–400 U/kg/dose 2–3 times per wk.
Adult (with serum erythropoietin ≤500 milliunits/mL and receiving ≤4200 mg AZT per week): Start
at 100 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk ×8 wk. If response is NOT satisfactory in reducing transfusion
requirements or increasing Hgb levels after 8 wk of therapy, dose may be increased by 50–100 U/
kg/dose given 3 times per wk and reevaluated every 4–8 wk thereafter. Patients are unlikely to
respond to doses >300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk.
For all ages, withhold therapy if Hgb >12 g/dL and resume therapy by decreasing dosage by 25%
once Hgb falls below 11 g/dL. For adults, discontinue therapy if Hgb does not increase after 8 wk of
the 300 U/kg/dose 3 times per wk dosage.
Anemia of prematurity (many regimens exist):
250 U/kg/dose SC 3 times per wk ×10 doses; alternatively, 200–400 U/kg/dose IV/SC 3–5 times per
wk for 2–6 wk (total dose per wk is 600–1400 U/kg). Administer with supplemental iron at 3–6 mg
elemental iron/kg/24 hr.

serious cardiovascular events, and thrombosis in various cancer patients, especially with Hgb levels
>12 g/dL, have been reported with epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
Evaluate serum iron, ferritin, TIBC before therapy. Iron supplementation recommended during therapy
unless iron stores are already in excess. Monitor Hct, BP, clotting times, platelets, BUN, serum
creatinine. Peak effect in 2–3 wk.
DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR ANEMIA IN CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
Reduce dose by ≥25%: when Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-wk period. Dose reductions can be
made more frequently than once every 4 wk if needed.
Increase dose by 25%: when Hgb does not increase by 1 g/dL after 4 wk of therapy. Dosage increments should not be made more frequently than once every 4 wk.
Withholding therapy: when Hgb >11 g/dL; restart therapy at a 25% lower dose after Hgb
decreases to target levels or <11 g/dL.
Inadequate response after a 12-week dose escalation: Use minimum effective dosage that will
maintain hemoglobin levels to avoid the need for recurrent blood transfusions and evaluate
other causes of anemia. Discontinue use if patient remains transfusion dependent.
DOSAGE REDUCTION ADJUSTMENT/WITHHOLDING THERAPY FOR ANEMIA IN CANCER:
If Hgb exceeds a level needed to avoid blood transfusion: Withhold dose and resume therapy at a
reduced dosage by 25% when Hgb approaches a level where blood transfusions may be needed.
If Hgb increases >1 g/dL in any 2-wk period or Hgb reaches a level to avoid blood transfusion:
Reduce dose by 25%.
May cause hypertension, seizure, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, edema, dizziness. SC route
provides sustained serum levels compared to IV route. For IV administration, infuse over 1–3 min.
Do not use multi-dose vial preparation for breastfeeding mothers because of concerns for benzyl
alcohol.

Contraindicated in heart failure caused by decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Use with
caution in bleeding disorders; inhibits platelet aggregation.
Dose-dependent side effects of nausea, diarrhea, jaw pain, bone pain, and headaches are
common. Other common side effects include hypotension, flushing, diarrhea, loss of appetite,
and chest and musculoskeletal pain. Reported complications include sepsis, local site infection,
and catheter dislodgement resulting in severe sepsis or rebound pulmonary hypertension (avoid
abrupt dose withdrawal and monitor for IV line interruptions). Hypoxia, flushing, and tachycardia
may suggest an overdose.
Use with medications exhibiting antiplatelet effects (e.g., SSRI antidepressants, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, NSAIDs, and anticoagulants) may increase risk for bleeding. May increase digoxin levels.
Systemic T1/2 is 2–5 min. Continuous IV infusion is administered via central venous catheter with

Avoid use in patients with known QT prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., hypokalemia,
hypomagnesemia, significant bradycardia), and receiving class IA or class III antiarrhythmic
agents, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors metabolized by CYP 450 3A4 (e.g., lovastatin or
simvastatin; increases risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis), cisapride, or pimozide.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in neonates receiving prophylactic therapy for pertussis; lifethreatening episodes of ventricular tachycardia associated with prolonged QTc interval; and
exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have been reported. May produce false-positive urinary
catecholamines, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, and 17-ketosteroids.
GI side effects common (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps). Cardiac dysrhythmia, anaphylaxis,
interstitial nephritis, and hearing loss have been reported. Use with caution in liver disease. Estolate
formulation may cause cholestatic jaundice, although hepatotoxicity is uncommon (2% of reported
cases). Inhibits CYP 450 1A2, 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May produce elevated digoxin, theophylline, carbamazepine, clozapine, cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone levels. Adjust dose in renal failure (see
Chapter 31). Use ideal body weight for obese patients when calculating doses.
Oral therapy should replace IV as soon as possible. Give oral doses after meals. Because of different
absorption characteristics, higher oral doses of EES are needed to achieve therapeutic effects. Avoid
IM route (pain, necrosis). For ophthalmic use, avoid contact of ointment tip with eye or skin.

Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD; limited data)
6–17 yr: A 10-wk open-label trial in which 28 subjects were given a weekly PRN increasing PO
dosage regimen of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/24 hr. Mean dosage of responders with significant
improvement at 11.1 ± 6.5 mg/24 hr. 25% of subjects responded at doses <10 mg/24 hr and

subjects could not tolerate the 10-mg/24 hr dose.
Social Anxiety Disorder (limited data):
10–17 yr: A 12-wk open-label trial in which 20 subjects were given an initial PO dosage of 5 mg
once daily × 7 days followed by 10 mg once daily. If needed and tolerated, increase by 5 mg/24 hr
at weekly intervals up to a maximum of 20 mg/24 hr. Two subjects did not complete the trial due
to lack of efficacy and tolerability. Sixty-five percent of the remaining subjects met the response
criteria with a mean final dose of 13 ± 4.1 mg/24 hr. Common adverse events included somnolence
(25%), insomnia (20%), flu symptoms (15%), increased appetite (15%), and decreased appetite
(15%).

Increased risk for serotonin syndrome when used with MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of
discontinuance), linezolid, or methylene blue; concurrent use considered contraindicated. Do
not use with pimozide because of risk for increased QTc interval. Use with caution with
hepatic or severe renal impairment; dosage adjustment may be needed. Avoid abrupt
discontinuation to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
Diaphoresis, GI discomfort, xerostomia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, sexual dysfunction,
and fatigue are common side effects. Abnormal bleeding, depression, QTc prolongation, and suicidal
ideation have been reported.
Primarily metabolized by the CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4 enzymes and is a weak inhibitor for CYP 450 2D6
enzyme. Consider an alternative medication (not significantly metabolized by CYP 450 2C19) for
individuals with ultrarapid CYP 450 2C19 activity. Poor CYP450 2C19 metabolizers can either initiate
therapy at 50% the usual dose and titrate to response or consider alternative therapy.
Taking with other medications with QTc prolongation may further increase that risk. Omeprazole may
increase the toxicity of escitalopram. Doses may be administered with or without food.

Contraindicated in serious infections, sepsis, or hypersensitivity to any of medication components.
Use with caution in patients with history of recurrent infections (including hepatitis B) or
underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections (including concomitant
immunosuppressive therapy), CNS demyelinating disorders, malignancies, immune-related
diseases, and latex allergy. Common adverse effects in children include headache, abdominal pain,
vomiting, and nausea. Injection site reactions (e.g., discomfort, itching, swelling), rhinitis,
dizziness, rash, depression, infections (varicella, aseptic meningitis, rare cases of TB, and fatal/
serious infections and sepsis), bone marrow suppression (e.g., aplastic anemia), sarcoidosis,
vertigo, and CNS demyelinating disorder have also been reported. Malignancies (some fatal and
∼50% were lymphomas) have been reported in children and adolescents.
Do not administer live vaccines concurrently with this drug. In JRA, it is recommended that before
initiating therapy, the patient be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines.
Onset of action is 1–4 wk, with peak effects usually within 3 mo.
Patients must be properly instructed on preparing and administering the medication (see specific
product information). For multi-dose vial, reconstitute vial by gently swirling its contents with the
supplied diluent (do not shake or vigorously agitate), as some foaming will occur. Reconstituted
solutions should be clear and colorless; unused portions must be stored in the refrigerator and used
within 14 days. Do not store Auto Touch auto-injector device in the refrigerator.
Drug is administered subcutaneously by rotating injection sites (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm) with
a max. single injection site dose of 25 mg. Administer new injections ≥1 inch from an old site and
NEVER where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

Obtain serum levels of concurrent anticonvulsants. Monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, CBC
with differential, platelets at baseline, and every 1–2 wk. Doses should be decreased by
50% in renally impaired patients.
When initiating adjunctive therapy (all ages), doses of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are reduced
by 20% to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and
carbamazepine. Further reductions of concomitant AED dosage may be necessary to minimize side
effects caused by drug interactions.
When converting to monotherapy, reduce other AEDs by one-third at the start of felbamate therapy.
Then after 2 wk and at the start of increasing the felbamate dosage, reduce other AEDs by an
additional one-third. At wk 3, continue to reduce other AEDs as clinically indicated.
Carbamazepine levels may be decreased; however, phenytoin and valproic acid levels may be increased.

cavity (above a rear molar, between the upper cheek and gum) and letting the tablet dissolve for
15–25 min. A second 100 mCg dose, if needed, may be administered 30 min after the start of the
first dose. If needed, increase dose initially in multiples of 100 mCg tablet when patients require >1
dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes. Must wait at least 4 hr before
treating another episode with buccal tabs. If titration requires >400 mCg/dose, use 200 mCg tabs.
Lozenges (≥16 yr): Start with 200 mCg by placing lozenge in the mouth between the cheek and
lower gum. If needed, may repeat dose 15 min after the completion of the first dose (30 min after
start of prior dose). If therapy requires >1 lozenge per episode, consider increasing the dose to the
next higher strength. Do not give more than 2 doses for each episode of breakthrough pain and
reevaluate long-acting opioid therapy if patient requires >4 doses/24 hr. Must wait at least 4 hr
before treating another episode with lozenges.

Use with caution in bradycardia, respiratory depression, and increased intracranial pressure.
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Fatalities and life-threatening respiratory
depression have been reported with inappropriate use (overdoses, use in opioid-naïve
patients, changing the patch too frequently, and exposing the patch to a heat source) of
the transdermal route.
Highly lipophilic and may deposit into fat tissue. IV onset of action 1–2 min with peak effects in
10 min. IV duration of action 30–60 min. Give IV dose over 3–5 min. Rapid infusion may cause
respiratory depression and chest wall rigidity. Respiratory depression may persist beyond the period
of analgesia. Transdermal onset of action 6–8 hr with a 72-hr duration of action. See Chapter 6 for
pharmacodynamic information with transmucosal and transdermal routes.
Buccal tabs and oral lozenges are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in
patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy. Buccal tabs (Fentora),
transdermal patches (Duragesic), and lozenge (Actiq) dosage forms are available through a restricted
distribution program (REMS) and are NOT bioequivalent (see package insert for conversion).
Intranasal route of administration for analgesia has an onset of action at 10–30 min. Pediatric studies has demonstrated that the intranasal fentanyl is equivalent to and better than morphine (PO/
IV/IM) and equivalent to intravenous fentanyl for providing analgesia.
Fentanyl is a substrate for the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme. Be aware of medications that inhibit or induce
this enzyme, for it may increase or decrease the effects of fentanyl, respectively.
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if drug is used for prolonged periods or in high doses at term.

Indication

Use with other medications known to prolong the QT interval and which are metabolized via
the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme (e.g., erythromycin) are considered contraindicated. May cause
nausea, headache, rash, vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatitis, cholestasis, and diarrhea.
Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, exfoliative skin disorders (e.g., SJS, TEN,
DRESS), and adrenal insufficiency (reversible) have been reported. Use with caution in
hepatic or renal dysfunction and in patients with hypokalemia, proarrhythmic conditions,
or advanced cardiac failure.
Inhibits CYP 450 2C9/10 and CYP 450 3A3/4 (weak inhibitor). May increase effects, toxicity, or
levels of cyclosporine, midazolam, phenytoin, rifabutin, tacrolimus, theophylline, warfarin, oral
hypoglycemics, and AZT. Rifampin increases fluconazole metabolism.
Consider using higher doses in morbidly obese patients. Adjust dose in renal failure (see
Chapter 31).
Pregnancy category is “C” for single 150 mg use for vaginal candidiasis, but a Danish study reports
a higher risk for miscarriages for during weeks 7–22 of gestation. Pregnancy category “D” is
for all other indications (high-dose use during first trimester of pregnancy may result in birth
defects).

Benzodiazepine overdose (IV, see remarks):
Child (limited data): 0.01 mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min PRN to a max. total
cumulative dose of 1 mg. As an alternative for repeat bolus doses, a continuous
infusion of 0.005–0.01 mg/kg/hr have been used.
Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 30 sec, if needed, give 0.3 mg 30 sec later over 30 sec. Additional doses
of 0.5 mg given over 30 sec Q1 min PRN up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg (usual cumulative dose: 1–3
mg). Patients with only partial response to 3 mg may require additional slow titration to a total of 5 mg.
Reversal of benzodiazepine sedation (IV):
Child: Initial dose: 0.01 mg/kg (max dose: 0.2 mg) given over 15 sec, if needed after 45 sec, 0.01
mg/kg (max. dose: 0.2 mg) Q1 min to a max. total cumulative dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 1 mg,
whichever is lower. Usual total dose: 0.08–1 mg (average 0.65 mg).
Adult: Initial dose: 0.2 mg over 15 sec, if needed after 45 sec, give 0.2 mg Q1 min to a max. total
cumulative dose of 1 mg. Doses may be repeated at 20 min interval (max. dose of 1 mg per 20
min interval) up to a max. dose of 3 mg in 1 hr.
Does not reverse narcotics. Onset of benzodiazepine reversal occurs in 1–3 min. Reversal
effects of flumazenil (T1/2 approximately 1 hr) may wear off sooner than benzodiazepine
effects. If patient does not respond after cumulative 1–3 mg dose, suspect agent other
than benzodiazepines.
May precipitate seizures, especially in patients taking benzodiazepines for seizure control or in
patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Fear and panic attacks in patients with history of
panic disorders have been reported.
Use with caution in liver dysfunction; flumazenil’s clearance is significantly reduced. Use normal
dose for initial dose and decrease the dosage and frequency for subsequent doses.

Contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (e.g., linezolid) due to possibility of seizures,
hyperpyrexia, and coma. Use with caution in patients with angle-closure glaucoma, receiving
diuretics, or with liver (reduce dose with cirrhosis) or renal impairment. May increase the effects
of tricyclic antidepressants. May cause headache, insomnia, nervousness, drowsiness, GI
disturbance, and weight loss. Increased bleeding diathesis with unaltered prothrombin time may
occur with warfarin. Hyponatremia has been reported. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression
and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
May displace other highly protein-bound drugs. Inhibits CYP 450 2C19, 2D6, and 3A3/4 drug metabolism isoenzymes, which may increase the effects or toxicity of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.
For example, use with pimozide or thioridazine may increase the risk for prolonged cardiac QTc
interval and is considered contraindicated. Use with serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, methylene
blue) and drugs that impair serotonin metabolism (MAOIs) may increase the risk for serotonin
syndrome. Carefully review the patients’ medication profile for potential interactions.
Delayed-release capsule is currently indicated for depression and is dosed at 90 mg Q7 days. It is
unknown if weekly dosing provides the same protection from relapse as does daily dosing.
Breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer, as adverse events to nursing infants have
been reported. Fluoxetine and metabolite are variable and are higher when compared with other
SSRIs. Maternal use of SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum may result in more difficult breastfeeding. Infants exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy may also have an increased risk for persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.

Contraindicated with hypersensitivity to milk proteins. See Fluticasone Preparations for
remarks. Vilanterol is a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist with a faster onset and longer
duration of action compared to salmeterol.
Hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycemia, muscle spasms, and tremor have been reported.
Titrate to the lowest effective strength after asthma is adequately controlled. This dosage form’s
breath-activated device requires a minimum inspiratory flow rate of 60 mL/min for proper dose
activation. Proper patient education including dosage administration technique is essential; see

Contraindicated with coadministration of cisapride, pimozide, thioridazine, tizanidine, or
MAO inhibitors. Use with caution in hepatic disease (dosage reduction may be necessary
as drug is extensively metabolized by the liver) and in combination with serotonergic drugs
(e.g., TCAs, triptans, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St.
John’s Wort). Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior
following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes.
Major substrate for CYP 450 1A2 and 2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6 should consider an
initial dose reduction of 25%–50% and titrate to response or use an alternative medication not
metabolized by this enzyme.
Inhibits CYP 450 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A3/4, which may increase the effects or toxicity of
drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Dose-related use of thioridazine with fluvoxamine may cause
prolongation of QT interval and serious arrhythmias. May increase warfarin plasma levels by 98%
and prolong PT. May increase toxicity and/or levels of theophylline, caffeine, and tricyclic antidepressants. Side effects include: headache, insomnia, somnolence, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia,
and dry mouth.
Titrate to lowest effective dose. Use a gradual taper when discontinuing therapy to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
Consider the benefits to potential risk for maternal use in breastfeeding. Maternal use during
pregnancy and postpartum may result in breastfeeding difficulties.

avoiding nephrotoxic medications may reduce risk). Hypocalcemia (increased risk if given with
pentamidine), hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia may also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions has
been reported. Use with ciprofloxacin may increase risk for seizures.
Correction of dehydration and adequate hydration reduces the risk for nephrotoxicity. 10–20 mL/kg

Contraindicated in patients with history of phenytoin or other hydantoin hypersensitivity. Use
with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and porphyria (consider amount of phosphate delivered by fosphenytoin in patients with phosphate restrictions). Drug is also metabolized to
liberate small amounts of formaldehyde, which is considered clinically insignificant with short-term
use (e.g., 1 wk). Side effects: hypokalemia (with rapid IV administration), slurred speech, dizziness,
ataxia, rash, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g., TEN, SJS; increased risk with patients with HLA-B*1502
allele), nystagmus, diplopia, and tinnitus. Angioedema has been reported. Increased unbound
phenytoin concentrations may occur in patients with renal disease or hypoalbuminemia; measure
“free” or “unbound” phenytoin levels in these patients.
Abrupt withdrawal may cause status epilepticus. BP and ECG monitoring should be present during
IV loading dose administration. Max. IV infusion rate: 2 mg PE/kg/min up to a max. of 150 mg PE/

Neonate (see remarks): 0.5–1 mg/kg/dose Q8–24 hr; max. dose: 2 mg/kg/dose
Infant and child: 1–2 mg/kg/dose Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 6 mg/kg/dose not to exceed
200 mg/dose
Adult: 20–40 mg/24 hr ÷ Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 200 mg/dose
PO:
Neonate: Bioavailability by this route is poor; doses of 1–3 mg/kg/dose once daily to BID have been
used.
Infant and child: Start at 2 mg/kg/dose; may increase by 1–2 mg/kg/dose no sooner than 6–8 hr
following the previous dose. Max. dose: 6 mg/kg/dose. Dosages have ranged from 1–6 mg/kg/dose
Q12–24 hr.
Adult: 20–80 mg/dose Q6–12 hr; max. dose: 600 mg/24 hr
Continuous IV infusion:
Infant and child: 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 0.05–0.4 mg/kg/hr infusion and titrate to effect
Adult: 40–100 mg IV bolus followed by 10–40 mg/hr infusion and titrate to effect
Contraindicated in anuria and hepatic coma. Use with caution in hepatic disease (hepatic
encephalopathy has been reported); cirrhotic patients may require higher than usual
doses. Ototoxicity may occur in presence of renal disease (especially when used with
aminoglycosides and other nephrotoxic drugs), with rapid IV injection (do not infuse >4
mg/min in adults), or with hypoproteinemia. May cause hypokalemia, alkalosis,
dehydration, hyperuricemia, and increased calcium excretion. Rash with eosinophilia and
systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported.
Prolonged use in premature infants and in children <4 yr may result in nephrocalcinosis.
May increase risk for PDA in premature infants during the first week of life.
Furosemide-resistant edema in pediatric patients may benefit with the addition of
metolazone. Some of these patients may have an exaggerated response leading to
hypovolemia, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension requiring fluid replacement. Severe
hypokalemia has been reported with a tendency for diuresis persisting for up to 24 hr after
discontinuing metolazone, prolonged use of laxatives, or concomitant use of
corticosteroids, ACTH, and large amounts of licorice.
High doses of furosemide may inhibit binding of thyroid hormones to carrier proteins and result in
transient increase in free thyroid hormones followed by an overall decrease in total thyroid hormone
levels.
Max. rate of intermittent IV dose: 0.5 mg/kg/min. For patients receiving ECMO, do not administer IV
doses directly into the ECMO circuit as the medication is absorbed in the circuit, which may result
in diminished effects and the need for higher doses.
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in pregnancy-induced hypertension.

Contraindicated in insulinoma, pheochromocytoma, and history of hypersensitivity to
glucagon and components. Drug product is genetically engineered and identical to
human glucagon. High doses have a cardiac stimulatory effect and have been used
with some success in β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. May cause
nausea, vomiting, urticaria, and respiratory distress. Necrolytic migratory erythema
(NME) has been reported with continuous IV infusion; assess benefit/risk for
continued use.
Do not delay glucose infusion; dose for hypoglycemia is 2–4 mL/kg of dextrose 25%.
Glucagon may increase the effects/toxicity of warfarin. Indomethacin use may decrease the effects
of glucagon.
Sufficient hepatic glycogen is necessary for effect; patients in states of starvation, with adrenal or
chronic hypoglycemia, may not have adequate levels of glycogen. Onset of action: IM: 8–10 min; IV:
1 min. Duration of action: IM: 12–27 min; IV: 9–17 min.
INTRANASAL USE: See product information for dose administration instructions. Dose does not need
to be inhaled and can be administered if the patient has nasal congestion or the common cold.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, rhinorrhea, nasal discomfort/congestion, cough, epistaxis, and irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. In type-1 pediatric diabetes
trials, the time to increase glucose ≥20 mg/dL from nadir was 11–15 min and peak plasma levels

severe symptoms
Contraindicated in severe toxic CNS depression, comas, Parkinson disease, and dementia
Lewy bodies. Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease (risk of hypotension), renal
or hepatic dysfunction, thyrotoxicosis, and in patients with epilepsy since the drug lowers
the seizure threshold. Extrapyramidal symptoms, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia, ECG
changes, nausea, and vomiting can occur. Higher than recommended doses are associated
with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and torsades de pointes. Leukopenia/neutropenia,
including agranulocytosis and rhabdomyolysis (IM route), and transient dyskinetic signs
(following abrupt withdrawal from maintenance therapies) have been reported.

HALOPERIDOL continued
Drug is metabolized by CYP 450 1A2, 2D6, and 3A3/4 isoenzymes. May also inhibit CYP 450 2D6 and
3A3/4 isoenzymes. Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) may increase levels
and effects of haloperidol. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital may decrease levels and effects of
haloperidol. Monitor for encephalopathic syndrome when used in combination with lithium.
For poor metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6, consider a 50% reduction of initial dose and titrate to
response, OR use an alternative medication not metabolized by this enzyme system.
Acutely aggravated patients may require doses as often as Q60 min. Decanoate salt is given every
3–4 wk in doses that are 10–15 times the individual patient’s stabilized oral dose.

Drug Dosages

These laboratory measurements are best measured 4–6 hr after initiation or changes in infusion rate.
Do not collect blood levels from the heparinized line or same extremity as site of heparin infusion.
If unfractionated heparin anti-Xa or aPTT levels are not available, a ratio of aPPT 1.5–2.5 times
control value has been used in the past. Unfractionated heparin anti-Xa level is NOT THE SAME as
low molecular weight heparin anti-Xa (used for monitoring low molecular weight heparin products
such as enoxaparin).
Use with IV nitroglycerin may decrease the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with subsequent
rebound upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Antithrombin III (human) and NSAIDs may increase
heparin’s anticoagulant effects and bleeding risk.
Use preservative-free heparin in neonates. Note: heparin flush doses may alter aPTT in small
patients; consider using more dilute heparin in these cases.
Use actual body weight when dosing obese patients. Due to recent regulatory changes to the manufacturing process, heparin products may exhibit decreased potency.
Antidote: Protamine sulfate (1 mg per 100 U heparin in previous 4 hr). For low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH), see Enoxaparin.

For IV use, give slowly over 30–60 min at a concentration ≤5 mg/mL to reduce risk for
nausea (lowering the rate may reduce severity). Adverse effects: thrombophlebitis, pruritus,
urticaria, GI symptoms, seizures, dizziness, hypotension, elevated LFTs, blood dyscrasias,
and penicillin allergy. Greater risk for seizures may occur with CNS infections, concomitant
use with ganciclovir, higher doses, and renal impairment. CSF penetration is variable but
best with inflamed meninges. Not recommended in CNS infections for neonates due to
cilastatin accumulation and seizure risk.
Do not administer with probenecid (increases imipenem/cilastatin levels) and ganciclovir (increased
risk for seizures). May significantly reduce valproic acid levels.

Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma and patients who used MAO inhibitors within 14 days.
See Chapter 3 for management of toxic ingestion. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression
and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Use
with caution in renal or hepatic impairment. Side effects include sedation, urinary retention,
constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, and arrhythmia. QHS dosing during first weeks
of therapy will reduce sedation. Monitor ECG, BP, CBC at start of therapy and with dose
changes. Tricyclics may cause mania. False-positive test for urine PCP screen may occur.
Therapeutic reference range for depression (sum of imipramine and desipramine) =
150–250 ng/mL. Levels >1000 ng/mL are toxic; however, toxicity may occur at >300 ng/mL.
Recommended serum sampling times at steady-state: Obtain trough level within 30 min prior to the
next scheduled dose after 5–7 days of continuous therapy.
Imipramine is a major substrate for CYP 450 2C19 and 2D6. See the remarks in amitriptyline for
pharmacogenomic dosing considerations. Carbamazepine may reduce imipramine levels, and
cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, labetalol, quinidine may increase imipramine levels.
Onset of antidepressant effects: 1–3 wk. Do not discontinue abruptly in patients receiving long-term
high-dose therapy.
Pregnancy category has not been officially assigned by the FDA as congenital abnormalities have

Intramuscular (IM) preparations:
Measles, postexposure prophylaxis for high-risk patients: 0.5 mL/kg/dose (max. dose: 15 mL) IM × 1
within 6 days of exposure.
IM administration: Administer in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or deltoid muscle of the
upper arm. Avoid gluteal region due to risk of injury to sciatic nerve. Consider splitting doses for
multiple injection sites to address age specific maximum IM injection volumes.
Use with caution in patients with increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., hypercoagulable states,
prolonged immobilization, in-dwelling catheters, estrogen use, thrombosis history,
cardiovascular risks, and hyperviscosity) or hemolysis (e.g., non-O blood type, associated
inflammatory conditions, and receiving high cumulative doses of immune globulins over
several days).
May cause flushing, chills, fever, headache, and hypotension. Hypersensitivity reaction may occur
when IV form is administered rapidly. Maltose-containing products may cause an osmotic diuresis.
May cause anaphylaxis in lgA-deficient patients due to varied amounts of lgA. Some products are
lgA depleted; consult a pharmacist.
To decrease risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, IV preparations containing
sucrose should not be infused at a rate such that the amount of sucrose exceeds 3 mg/kg/min.
SC route provides higher serum trough levels, lower rate of adverse reactions, and shorter administration time when compared with the IV route. Use of adjusted body weight [ABW = Ideal Body Weight +
0.5 (Actual Body Weight − Ideal Body Weight] for dosing in obese patients has been recommended.
Delay immunizations after immune globulin administration (see latest AAP Red Book for details).

Avoid use with history of severe cutaneous reactions to iohexol. Use with caution in
dehydration, previous allergic reaction to a contrast medium, iodine sensitivity, asthma,
hay fever, food allergy, congestive heart failure, severe liver or renal impairment, diabetic
nephropathy, multiple myeloma, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and sickle cell
disease. Allergic reactions, arrhythmias, hypothyroidism, transient thyroid suppression,
and nephrotoxicity have been reported.
Children at higher risk for adverse events with contrast medium administration may include those
having asthma, sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, or those aged <12 mo.
Use NOT recommended with drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., phenothiazines), amiodarone
(increased risk of cardiotoxicity), and metformin (lactic acidosis and acute renal failure).
Many other uses exist, see package insert for additional information. Iohexol is particularly useful
when barium sulfate is contraindicated in patients with suspected bowel perforation or those
where aspiration of contrast medium is of concern. Oral dose is poorly absorbed from the
normal GI tract (0.1%–0.5%); absorption increases with bowel perforation or bowel obstruction.
Concentrations 302–755 mg iohexol/mL have osmolalities from 1.1 to 3 times that of plasma (285
mOsm/kg) and CSF (301 mOsm/kg) and may be hypertonic.

IPRATROPIUM BROMIDE ± ALBUTEROL continued
Inhalation spray (Combivent Respimat):
Ipratroprium in combination with albuterol (Acute use in the ED or ICU; cont.):
<12 yr: 4–8 sprays Q20 min × 3
≥12 yr: 8 sprays Q20 min × 3
Contraindicated in atropine hypersensitivity. Use with caution in narrow-angle glaucoma or
bladder neck obstruction, though ipratropium has fewer anticholinergic systemic effects
than atropine. May cause anxiety, dizziness, headache, GI discomfort, and cough with
inhaler or nebulized use. Epistaxis, nasal congestion, and dry mouth/throat have been
reported with the nasal spray. Reversible anisocoria may occur with unintentional
aerosolization of drug to the eyes, particularly with mask nebulizers. Proven efficacy of
nebulized solution in pediatrics is currently limited to reactive airway disease management
in the emergency room and intensive care unit areas.
Current aerosol inhaler product does not contain soy products. Combination ipratropium and
albuterol products are currently approved for use only in adults and has not been formally studied
in children. See albuterol for additional remarks if using the combination product.
Bronchodilation onset of action is 1–3 min with peak effects within 1.5–2 hr and duration of action
of 4–6 hr.
Shake inhaler well prior to use with spacer. Nebulized solution may be mixed with albuterol (or use
the combination product).
Pregnancy category is “C” for Combivent Respimat. Breastfeeding safety extrapolated from safety
of atropine.

FERRIC GLUCONATE (IV):
Iron deficiency anemia in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis who are receiving
supplemental erythropoietin therapy (most require 8 doses at 8 sequential dialysis
treatments to achieve a favorable response):
Child ≥6 yr: 1.5 mg/kg elemental Fe (0.12 mL/kg) IV; max. dose: 125 mg elemental Fe/dose. Dilute
dose in 25 mL NS and infuse over 1 hr.
Adult: 125 mg elemental Fe in 100 mL NS IV; infuse over 1 hr. Most require a minimum cumulative
dose of 1 g elemental Fe administered over 8 sessions.
IRON DEXTRAN (IV or IM):
Iron deficiency anemia (≥4 mo, child, adolescent):
Test dose (IV over 5 min or IM; may initiate treatment dose 1 hr after test dose):
<10 kg: 10 mg
10–20 kg: 15 mg
≥20 kg: 25 mg
Total replacement dose of iron dextran (mL) = 0.0476 × lean body wt (kg) × (desired Hb [g/dL] −
measured Hb [g/dL]) + 1 mL per 5 kg lean body weight (up to max. of 14 mL). Total replacement
dose is divided into smaller daily doses if exceeds respective IV or IM daily max. doses (see below).
Acute blood loss: Total replacement dose of iron dextran (mL) = 0.02 × blood loss (mL) × hematocrit
expressed as decimal fraction. Assumes 1 mL of RBC = 1 mg elemental iron.
If no reaction to test dose, give remainder of replacement dose ÷ over 2–3 daily doses.
Max. daily IV dose: 100 mg
Max. daily IM dose:
<5 kg: 0.5 mL (25 mg)
5–10 kg: 1 mL (50 mg)
>10 kg: 2 mL (100 mg)

IV administration: Dilute in NS at a max. concentration of 50 mg/mL and infuse over 1–6 hr at a
max. rate of 50 mg/min.
IRON SUCROSE (IV):
Test dose (optional): Infuse 25% of first day dose up to a max. of 25 mg undiluted over 30 min.
Iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease:
Child:
ESRD on hemodialysis: (limited data from 14 children): 1 mg/kg/dialysis was adequate for
correcting ferritin levels and 0.3 mg/kg/dialysis was successful in maintaining ferritin levels
between 193 and 250 mCg/L. Doses were administered during the last hr of each dialysis and
are recommended at a frequency of 3 times a week. A 10 mg test dose was administered.
Non-renal iron deficiency, refractory to PO therapy (limited data): Calculate total iron
replacement dose (mg) = 0.6 × wt (kg) × (100 − [measured Hb ÷ desired Hb × 100]).
Replacement dose is administered by giving an initial dose of 5–7 mg/kg (max. dose: 100
mg/24 hr) followed by a maintenance dose of 5–7 mg/kg/dose (max. dose: 300 mg/24 hr)
Q3–7 days until total iron replacement dose is achieved.
Adult:
Hemodialysis-dependent: 100 mg elemental Fe 1–3 times a wk during dialysis up to a total
cumulative dose of 1000 mg. May continue to administer at lowest dose to maintain target
Hb, Hct, and iron levels.
Nonhemodialysis-dependent: 200 mg elemental Fe on 5 different days over a 2 wk period (total
cumulative dose: 1000 mg).
IV administration: May administer undiluted over 2–5 min. For an infusion, dilute each 100 mg with
a max. of 100 mL NS and infuse over at least 15 min.

Oral therapy with iron salts is preferred, injectable routes are painful. Gluconate and sucrose
salts may be better tolerated than iron dextran. Adverse effects include hypotension, GI
disturbances, fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgias, cramps, and headaches. Hypersensitivity
reactions have been reported for iron dextran and sucrose products; use of test dose prior
to first therapeutic dose is recommended.
IM administration is only possible with iron dextran salt. Follow infusion recommendations for
specific product. Monitor vital signs during IV infusion. TIBC levels may not be meaningful within
3 wk after dosing.
Efficacy and safety of iron sucrose for maintenance therapy has been evaluated in children 2 yr
and older with CKD and receiving erythropoietin therapy. Common side effects include headache,
respiratory tract viral infection, peritonitis, vomiting, pyrexia, dizziness, and cough.
Pregnancy category is “B” for ferric gluconate and iron sucrose, and “C” for iron dextran.

Oral solution and capsule dosage form should NOT be used interchangeably; oral solution is
more bioavailable. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or
esophageal candidiasis. Contraindicated in CHF and certain interacting drugs (see below).
Use with caution in hepatic and/or renal impairment, cardiac dysrhythmias, and azole
hypersensitivity. May cause GI symptoms, headaches, rash, liver enzyme elevation,
hepatitis, and hypokalemia. Double/blurred vision, dizziness, and tremor have been
reported.
Like ketoconazole, it inhibits the activity of the CYP-450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme. Thus, the
coadministration of cisapride, dofetilide, felodipine, methadone, nisoldipine, pimozide, quinidine,
triazolam, lovastatin, simvastatin, ergot derivatives, and oral midazolam is contraindicated. May
increase systemic hormone concentrations of oral contraceptives. See remarks in Ketoconazole for
additional drug interaction information.
Steady-state serum concentrations of >0.25 mg/L itraconazole and >1 mg/L hydroxyitraconazole
(metabolite) have been recommended. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: any
time after 2 wk after continuous dosing. Itraconazole has a 34–42-hour T1/2.
Administer oral solution on an empty stomach but administer capsules with food. Oral capsule
bioavailability has been shown to be reduced in immunocompromised patients. Achlorhydria
reduces absorption of the drug. Do not use oral liquid dosage form in patients with GFR <30 mL/
min because of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin excipient has reduced clearance with renal failure.

respiratory depression, and stimulation of salivary secretions. Cystitis has been reported
with chronic use/abuse. Intravenous use may induce general anesthesia. Diplopia and
nystagmus have been noted following IV administration. False-positive test for urine
phencyclidine (PCP) screen may occur.
Coadministration of an anticholinergic agent may be added in situations of clinically significant
hypersalivation in patients with impaired ability to mobilize secretions. Benzodiazepine may
be used in the presence of a ketamine-associated recovery reaction (prophylaxis use in adults
may be beneficial). Ondansetron prophylaxis can slightly reduce vomiting. See Ann Emerg Med.
2001;57:449–461 for additional use information in the emergency department.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C9 and 3A4 isoenzymes. Consider potential drug interactions
with respective enzyme inhibitors and inducers, especially with prolonged use.
Rate of IV infusion should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min and should not be administered in less than 60
sec. For additional information including onset and duration of action, see Chapter 6.

The systemic dosage form should NOT be first-line treatment for any fungal infection due to
concerns of hepatotoxicity and adrenal gland effects (per the FDA).
Monitor LFTs in long-term use and adrenal function for patients at risk. Drugs that decrease
gastric acidity will decrease absorption. May cause nausea, vomiting, rash, headache,
pruritus, and fever. Hepatotoxicity (including fatal cases) has been reported; use with hepatic
impairment is contraindicated. High doses may decrease adrenocortical function and serum
testosterone levels. Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), has been reported with
all dosage forms.
Safety and efficacy with topical use in seborrheic dermatitis for patients >12 yr of age has been
established. Avoid topical use on breast or nipples in nursing mothers.

Inhibits CYP 450 3A4. Contraindicated when used with cisapride, disopyramide, methadone,
mefloquine, quinidine, terfenadine, pimozide, or any drug that can prolong the QT interval (because
of risk for cardiac arrhythmias), and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., simvastatin, and lovastatin). Excessive sedation and prolonged hypnotic effects with triazolam use (also contraindicated). May increase levels/effects of phenytoin, digoxin, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, nevirapine,
protease inhibitors, and warfarin. Achlorhydria, phenobarbital, rifampin, isoniazid, H2 blockers,
antacids, and omeprazole can decrease levels of oral ketoconazole.
Administering oral doses with food or acidic beverages and 2 hr prior to antacids will increase
absorption. For topical products, avoid contact with eyes and other mucous membranes.

Converting from other single antiepileptic drug (AED) to lacosamide monotherapy: administer lacosamide in combination with the established single AED for at least 3 days before tapering. Gradually
withdrawing the concomitant AED over 6 wk is recommended.
IV use: Use same dose when converting from PO to IV and vice versa. IV use should be considered for
short-term use and has not been studied in pediatrics.
­

Use with caution with known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., second-degree AV block),
severe cardiac disease (e.g., MI or heart failure), concomitant use with drugs known to
prolong PR interval, and renal (see Chapter 31) and hepatic impairment. Lacosamide
undergoes 95% renal excretion; a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is
recommended for adult and pediatric patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/
min and ESRD), or with mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in
severe hepatic impairment. Dose reduction may be also necessary with concurrent strong
inhibitor of CYP 450 3A4 or 2C9 medication. Patients with mild/moderate hepatic
impairment should be observed closely during dose titration. Oral bioavailability is
approximately 100%.
Most common side effects in adults include diplopia, headache, dizziness, and nausea.
Somnolence and irritability were frequently reported in pediatric studies. Patients should
be advised of potential dizziness, ataxia, and syncope with use. Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (including DRESS, affecting the skin, kidney and liver), worsening of seizures,
agranulocytosis, and euphoria (high doses) have been reported. As with other AEDs, monitor for
suicidal behavior and ideation.
Oral doses may be administered with or without food. Swallow tablets whole; do not cut tablets. IV
doses should be administered over 30–60 min. Do not abruptly withdraw therapy; gradually taper
to prevent potential seizures.

See aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines for remarks for use in HIV. Oral tablet dosage form is
preferred over oral solution for children ≥14 kg treated for HIV because subjects in the
ARROW clinical trial receiving oral solution had lower rates of HIV viral suppression, lower
plasma lamivudine exposure, and developed viral resistance more frequently.
May cause headache, fatigue, GI disturbances, rash, and myalgia/arthralgia. Lactic acidosis, severe
hepatomegaly with steatosis, post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis B and ALT elevations,

Enzyme-inducing AEDs include carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. StevensJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and other potentially life-threatening rashes
have been reported in children (0.3%–0.8%) and adults (0.08%–0.3%) for adjunctive
therapy in seizures. Reported rates for adults treated for bipolar/mood disorders as
monotherapy and adjunctive therapy are 0.08% and 0.13%, respectively. May cause
fatigue, drowsiness, ataxia, rash (especially with valproic acid), headache, nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. Diplopia, nystagmus, aseptic meningitis, hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis, aggression, and alopecia have also been reported. False-positive test
for urine phencyclidine (PCP) screen may occur.
Use during the first 3 mo of pregnancy may result in a higher chance for cleft lip or cleft palate in the
newborn. Suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported.
If converting from immediate-release to extended-release dosage form, initial dose of extendedrelease should match the total daily dose of the immediate-release dosage and be administered
once daily. Adjust dose as needed with the recommended dosage guidelines.
Reduce maintenance dose in renal failure. Reduce all doses (initial, escalation, and maintenance) in
liver dysfunction defined by the Child-Pugh grading system as follows:
Grade B: moderate dysfunction, decrease dose by ∼50%
Grade C: severe dysfunction, decrease dose by ∼75%
Withdrawal symptoms may occur if discontinued suddenly. A stepwise dose reduction
over ≥2 wk (∼50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more
rapid withdrawal.
Lamotrigine is metabolized by uridine 5′- diphospho-glucuronyl transferases (UGT). Strong
and moderate inducers of CYP 450 3A4 are known to induce UGT to increase lamotrigine
clearance. Acetaminophen, carbamazepine, oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol), phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, and rifampin may decrease levels of lamotrigine. Valproic
acid may increase levels. False positive urine drug screen for phencyclidine (PCP) has been
reported.
Safety and efficacy for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder in 10–17 yr olds were not established
in a RCT in 301 subjects.

Do not abruptly withdraw therapy, to reduce risk for seizures. Use with caution in renal
impairment (reduce dose; see Chapter 31) , hemodialysis, and neuropsychiatric
conditions.
May cause loss of appetite, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, somnolence, agitation, depression, and
mood swings. Drowsiness, fatigue, nervousness, and aggressive behavior have been reported in
children. Nonpsychotic behavioral symptoms reported in children are approximately 3 times greater
than in adults (37.6% vs. 13.3%). Suicidal behavior or ideation, serious dermatological reactions
(e.g., Stevens Johnson and TEN), hematologic abnormalities (e.g., anemia, leukopenia), hyponatremia, and hypertension have been reported. Levetiracetam may decrease carbamazepine’s effects.
Ginkgo may decrease levetiracetam’s effects.
Drug has excellent PO absorption. For IV use, use similar immediate-release PO dosages only when
the oral route of administration is not feasible. Extended-release tablet is designed for once-daily
administration at similar daily dosage of the immediate-release forms (e.g., 1000 mg once daily
of the extended release tablet is equivalent to 500 mg BID of the immediate release tablet).
Disintegrating tabs (Spritam) may be administered by allowing the tablet to disintegrate in the
mouth when taken with a sip of liquid or made into a suspension (see package insert); do not

Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to other quinolones. Avoid in patients with history of
QTc prolongation or taking QTc prolonging drugs, and excessive sunlight exposure.
Use with caution in diabetes, seizures, myasthenia gravis, children <18 yr, and renal
impairment (adjust dose, see Chapter 31). May cause GI disturbances, headache, and
blurred vision with the ophthalmic solution. Musculoskeletal disorders (e.g.,
arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, and gait abnormality) may occur. Peripheral
neuropathy and uveitis have been reported. Safety in pediatric patients treated more
than 14 days has not been evaluated. Like other quinolones, tendon rupture can occur
during or after therapy (risk increases with concurrent corticosteroids). Psychiatric
adverse events, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and blood glucose
disturbances have been reported. Use with NSAIDs may increase risk of CNS
stimulation and seizures.
Infuse IV over 1–1.5 hr; avoid IV push or rapid infusion because of risk of hypotension. Do not
administer antacids or other divalent salts with or within 2 hr of oral levofloxacin dose; otherwise
may be administer with or without food.

Contraindications include acute MI, thyrotoxicosis, and uncorrected adrenal insufficiency.
May cause hyperthyroidism, rash, growth disturbances, hypertension, worsening of diabetic
control, decreased bone mineral density (primarily in post-menopausal females),
arrhythmias, diarrhea, and weight loss. Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral
epiphysis have been reported in children. Overtreatment may cause craniosynostosis in
infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children.
Total replacement dose may be used in children unless there is evidence of cardiac disease; in that
case, begin with one-fourth of maintenance and increase weekly. Titrate dosage with clinical
status and serum T4 and TSH.
Increases the effects of warfarin. Phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, iron and calcium supplements, antacids, grapefruit juice, and orlistat may decrease levothyroxine levels. Tricyclic
antidepressants and SSRIs may enhance toxic effects. Use with ketamine may cause hypertension
and tachycardia. High doses of propranolol or dexamethasone, and amiodarone may decrease the
conversion of T4 to T3.
100 mCg levothyroxine = 65 mg thyroid USP. Administer oral doses on an empty stomach and
tablets with a full glass of water. Iron and calcium supplements and antacids may decrease
absorption; do not administer within 4 hr of these agents. Excreted in low levels in breast milk;

For cardiac arrest, amiodarone is the preferred agent over lidocaine; lidocaine may used only
when amiodarone is not available.
Contraindicated in Stokes-Adams or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndromes and SA, AV, or
intraventricular heart block without a pacemaker. Solutions containing dextrose may be
contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products. Side effects include
hypotension, asystole, seizures, and respiratory arrest. Anaphylaxic reactions have been reported.
Local anesthetic use has been associated with methemoglobinemia.
CYP 450 2D6 and 3A3/4 substrate. Use with caution in severe liver or renal disease. Decrease dose
in hepatic failure or decreased cardiac output. Do not use topically for teething. Prolonged infusion
may result in toxic accumulation of lidocaine, especially in infants. Do not use epinephrinecontaining solutions for treatment of arrhythmias.
Therapeutic levels 1.5–5 mg/L. Toxicity occurs at >7 mg/L. Toxicity in neonates may occur at >5 mg/L
due to reduced protein binding of drug. Elimination T1/2: premature infant: 3.2 hr, adult: 1.5–2 hr.
When using the topical patch, avoid exposing the application site to external heat sources as this
may increase the risk for toxicity.

Contraindicated in premature infants and seizure disorders. Use with caution with drugs
that lower seizure threshold. Systemically absorbed. Risk of toxic effects is greater in
young children; use other agents (permethrin) in infants, young children (<2 yr), and
during pregnancy. Lindane is considered second-line therapy owing to side-effect risk and
reports of resistance.
May cause a rash; rarely may cause seizures or aplastic anemia. For scabies, change clothing and bed
sheets after starting treatment and treat family members. For pediculosis pubis, treat sexual contacts.
Avoid contact with face, urethral meatus, damaged skin, or mucous membranes. Do not use any

LISINOPRIL continued
Use lower initial dose (50% of recommended dose) if using with a diuretic or with the
presence of hyponatremia, hypovolemia, severe CHF, or decreased renal function.
Contraindicated in hypersensitivity and history of angioedema with other ACE inhibitors, and
in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril). Do not use with aliskiren in patients
with diabetes. Avoid use with dialysis with high-flux membranes because anaphylactoid reactions
have been reported. Use with caution in aortic or bilateral renal artery stenosis, and hepatic
impairment. Side effects include cough, dizziness, headache, hyperkalemia, hypotension (especially with concurrent diuretic or antihypertensive agent use), rash, and GI disturbances. Mood
alterations, including depressive symptoms, have been reported.
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with lisinopril and angiotensin receptor antagonists
(e.g., losartin) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment. Diabetic patients on lisinopril treated with oral antidiabetic agents
should be monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of use. NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin) may decrease linsinopril’s effects. Use with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, everolimus)
may increase risk for angioedema. Adjust dose in renal impairment (see Chapter 31).
Onset of action: 1 hr with maximal effect in 6–8 hr. Long-term blood pressure monitoring is recommended at Q2–4 wk until good control is achieved, followed by Q3–4 mo.
Additional indications with limited data in children include proteinuria associated with mild IgA
nephropathy, and renal protection for diabetes or renal parenchymal disease.
Lisinopril should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.

Contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma and severe hypotension. Use with caution in
renal insufficiency (glucoronide metabolite clearance is reduced), hepatic insufficiency
(may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; decrease dose with severe hepatic impairment),
compromised pulmonary function, and use of CNS depressant medications. May cause
respiratory depression, especially in combination with opioids and other sedatives. May
also cause sedation, dizziness, mild ataxia, mood changes, rash, and GI symptoms.
Paradoxical excitation has been reported in children (10%–30% of patients <8 yr old).
When compared to diazepam for status epilepticus (3 mo–17 yr), lorazepam was found to be more
sedating with a longer time to return to baseline mental status.
Significant respiratory depression and/or hypotension has been reported when used in combination
with loxapine. Probenecid and valproic acid may increase the effects/toxicity of lorazepam and oral
contraceptive steroids may decrease lorazepam’s effects.
Injectable product may be given rectally. Benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol may be toxic to newborns at higher doses.

Use with caution in angioedema (current or past), excessive hypotension (volume depletion),
hepatic (use lower starting dose) or renal (contains potassium) impairment, hyperkalemia
(including use with medications that can cause hyperkalemia), renal artery stenosis and
severe CHF. Not recommended in patients <6 yr or in children with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73
m2, owing to lack of data.
Discontinue use as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected because injury and death to developing fetus may occur. Pregnancy category is “C” during the first trimester but changes to “D” for
the second and third trimesters.
Diarrhea, asthenia, dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension are common. Thrombocytopenia, rhabdomyolysis, hallucinations, and angioedema have been rarely reported.
Losartan is a substrate for CYP 450 2C9 (major) and 3A4. Fluconazole and cimetidine may increase
losartan effects/toxicity. Rifampin, phenobarbital, and indomethacin may decrease its effects.
Losartan may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Do not use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes or with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system
with losartin and ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril) or aliskiren is associated with increased risk for

Dosage modification when used with CYP 450 3A inhibitors:
Already taking Orkambi and initiating a strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole): no
dosage adjustment
Already taking a strong CYP 450 3A inhibitor and initiating Orkambi: Reduce Orkambi dosage to
1 tablet or 1 packet of granules every other day × the first week followed by the recommended
daily dose. If Orkambi is interrupted for >1 wk and re-initiated while taking strong CYP 450 3A
inhibitors, Orkambi should be reintroduced with the reduced dosage of 1 tablet or 1 packet of
granules every other day × 1 wk followed by the recommended daily dose.
Works on CFTR trafficking defect by acting as a CFTR corrector (lumecaftor) and in
combination with a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor). Indicated for individuals with homozygous
F508del CFTR mutation.
Respiratory events, such as chest discomfort, dyspnea and abnormal respiration, may occur during the initiation of therapy and may vary from transient to severe (requiring discontinuation).
Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, fatigue, nasal discharge, and
URIs. Increased liver enzymes and cataracts may occur; monitor AST/ALT and ocular exam at
baseline. Repeat AST/ALT every 3 mo for the first year followed by annual assessments. Repeat
ocular exams annually. Hypertension has been reported. May cause a false positive urine drug
screen for cannabinoids.
Use with caution with CrCl ≤30 mL/min and ESRD. Reduce dose with moderate/severe hepatic
impairment (see dosage section) or when initiating therapy while taking a strong CYP 450 3A4
inhibitor.
Lumecaftor is a strong inducer of CYP 450 3A and ivacaftor is a CYP 450 3A substrate; see dose
modification table in the dosing section. Use with strong CYP 450 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin,
rifabutin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort) are not recommended. Lumecaftor/ivacaftor may reduce
the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives and increase the incidence of menstruation-associated
side effects (e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and irregular menses). Always evaluate potential
drug-drug interactions; see https://www.orkambihcp.com/drug-interactionsddi–tool. Avoid food or
drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.
Administer all doses with high-fat foods to assure absorption. Oral granules can be mixed with 5 mL
of soft foods or liquids such as puréed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, applesauce, water, breast milk,
infant formula, milk, or juice. Once mixed, it should be consumed within an hour. If a dose (all
dosage forms) is missed within 6 hr of a scheduled dose, administer a dose immediately. However,
if the missed dose is >6 hr, skip that dose and resume therapy at the next scheduled dose. Never
take a double dose for a missed dose.

cardiac dysrhythmias and neurologic disease. May cause dizziness, ringing of the ears,
headache, syncope, psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, paranoia, depression,
hallucinations, and psychotic behavior), seizures, ocular abnormalities, GI symptoms,
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. If neurologic or psychiatric side effects occur,
discontinue therapy and use an alternative medication. Most adverse events occur within 3
doses with prophylaxis use. Monitor liver enzymes and ocular exams for therapies >1 yr.
Mefloquine is a substrate and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and may reduce valproic acid levels.
ECG abnormalities may occur when used in combination with quinine, quinidine, chloroquine,
halofantrine, and β-blockers. If any of the aforementioned antimalarial drugs is used in the
initial treatment of severe malaria, initiate mefloquine at least 12 hr after the last dose of any
of these drugs. Do not initiate halofantrine or ketoconazole within 15 days of the last dose
of mefloquine. Use with chloroquine may increase risk for seizures. Rifampin may decrease
mefloquine levels.
Do not take on an empty stomach. Administer with at least 240 mL (8 oz) water. Treatment failures
in children may be related to vomiting of administered dose. If vomiting occurs less than 30
min after the dose, administer a second full dose. If vomiting occurs 30–60 min after the dose,

discomfort, pancreatitis, pericarditis, and rash. Angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
DRESS, fatal infections (e.g., sepsis and pneumonia; discontinue use), and photosensitivity
have been reported. May cause a false-positive urinary normetanephrine test.
Safety and efficacy of Asacol in children 5–17 yr for mild/moderate acute ulcerative colitis have been
established over a 6 wk period. However, efficacy for maintenance of remission was not established
in a 26 wk RCT (potential factors affecting outcome included improper dosage used and premature
termination of trial). Safety and efficacy of Canasa suppositories have not been demonstrated for
mild/moderate active ulcerative proctitis in a 6-wk open-label study in 49 patients 5–17 yr old.
Do not administer with lactulose or other medications that can lower intestinal pH. Use with myelosuppressive drugs (e.g., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine may increase risk for blood disorders,
bone marrow failure and associated complications.
Two Delzicol 400-mg capsules have not been shown to be interchangeable or substitutable with one

Assess patient’s eGFR prior to initiating therapy. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment
(<30 mL/min/1.73 m2), hepatic impairment (increased risk for lactic acidosis), CHF, and
metabolic acidosis and during radiology studies using iodinated contrast media. Use with
caution when transferring patients from chlorpropamide therapy (potential hypoglycemia
risk), excessive alcohol intake, hypoxemia, dehydration, surgical procedures, mild/moderate
renal impairment, hepatic disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Fatal lactic acidosis (diarrhea; severe muscle pain, cramping; shallow and fast breathing; unusual
weakness and sleepiness) and decrease in vitamin B12 levels have been reported. May cause GI
discomfort (∼50% incidence), anorexia, and vomiting. Transient abdominal discomfort or diarrhea have been reported in 40% of pediatric patients. Organic cationic transporter-2 (OCT2)and
multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine), furosemide, and nifedipine may
increase the effects/toxicity of metformin. In addition to monitoring serum glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin, monitor renal function and hematologic parameters (baseline and annual).
Adult patients initiated on 500 mg PO BID may also have their dose increased to 850 mg PO BID after
2 wk.
COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULFONYLUREAS: If patient has not responded to 4 wk of maximum
doses of metformin monotherapy, consider gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea with continued
maximum metformin dosing (even if failure with sulfonylurea has occurred). Attempt to identify the
minimum effective dosage for each drug (metformin and sulfonylurea) because the combination
can increase risk for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. If patient does not respond to 1–3 mo of
combination therapy with maximum metformin doses, consider discontinuing combination therapy
and initiating insulin therapy.

Detoxification or maintenance: See package insert.
Unintentional overdoses have resulted in fatalities and severe adverse events such as
respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias. Use with caution in hepatic (avoid in
severe cases) and biliary tract impairment. May cause respiratory depression, sedation,
increased intracranial pressure, hypotension, and bradycardia. Cardiac QT interval
prolongation and serious arrhythmias have occurred mostly with higher doses; avoid use
with other medications which may prolong QT interval.
Average T½: children 19 hr, and adults 35 hr. Duration of action PO is 6–8 hr initially and 22–48 hr
after repeated doses. Respiratory effects last longer than analgesia. Accumulation may occur with
continuous use making it necessary to adjust dose.

Nevirapine may decrease serum levels of methadone. Fatalities have been reported with abuse in
combination with benzodiazepines. Serotonin syndrome has been reported with use with selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), TCAs,
5-HT3 antagonists, MAO inhibitors, and drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter
system (e.g., trazodone, tramadol). Methadone is a substrate for CYP 450 3A3/4, 2D6, and 1A2 and
inhibitor of 2D6.
See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing and onset of action. Adjust dose in renal failure (see
Chapter 31).
A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)is required for healthcare providers to
ensure the benefits outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. See www.fda.gov/

Drug Dosages

May increase serum concentrations/effects of tricyclic antidepressants, dopamine agonists (e.g.,
haloperidol), phenytoin, phenobarbital, and warfarin. May decrease the effects of antihypertensive
drugs. Effect of methylphenidate may be potentiated by MAO inhibitors; hypertensive crisis may
also occur if used within 14 days of discontinuance of the MAO inhibitor.
Extended/sustained-release dosage forms have either an 8- or 24-hr dosage interval (as
stipulated previously). Concerta dosage form delivers 22.2% of its dose as an immediate-release
product with the remaining amounts as an extended-release product (e.g., 18-mg strength: 4 mg
as immediate release and 14 mg as extended release). Jornay PM is dosed only in the evening and
should NOT be taken in the morning. Do not consume alcohol with Ritalin LA dosage form, because
it may result in a more rapid release of the drug. Do not expose transdermal application site to
external heat sources (e.g., electric blankets, heating pads); this may increase drug release.

steroids, may cause hypertension, leukocytosis, pseudotumor cerebri, acne, Cushing
syndrome, adrenal axis suppression, GI bleeding, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis.
Barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampin may enhance methylprednisolone clearance. Erythromycin,
itraconazole, and ketoconazole may increase methylprednisolone levels. Methylprednisolone may

Contraindicated in sinus bradycardia, heart block >1st degree, sick sinus syndrome (except with
functioning pacemaker), cardiogenic shock, and uncompensated CHF. Use with caution in
hepatic dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, history of severe anaphylactic
hypersensitivity drug reactions, pheochromocytoma, and concurrent use with verapamil,
diltiazem, or anesthetic agents that may decrease myocardial function. Should not be used
with bronchospastic diseases. Reserpine and other drugs that deplete catecholamines (e.g.,
MAO inhibitors) may increase the effects of metoprolol. Metoprolol is a CYP 450 2D6 substrate.
Poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP 2D6 inhibitors will
have significant increases in metoprolol blood levels to decrease its cardioselectivity.
Avoid abrupt cessation of therapy in ischemic heart disease; angina, ventricular arrhythmias, and MI
have occurred. Common side effects include bradyarrhythmia, heart block, heart failure, pruritus,
rash, GI disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, and depression. Bronchospasm, dyspnea, and elevations

Avoid use in first-trimester pregnancy. Use with caution in patients with CNS disease, blood
dyscrasias, severe liver (reduce dose by 50% with Child-Pugh C), or renal disease (GFR
<10 mL/min; see Chapter 31). If using single 2-g dose in a breast-feeding mother,
discontinue breastfeeding for 12–24 hr to allow excretion of the drug.
Nausea, diarrhea, urticaria, dry mouth, leukopenia, vertigo, metallic taste, and peripheral neuropathy
may occur. Candidiasis may worsen. May discolor urine. Patients should not ingest alcohol
for 24–48 hr after dose (disulfiram-type reaction). Fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported with
individuals with Cockayne syndrome.
Single-dose oral regimen no longer recommended in bacterial vaginosis due to poor efficacy. May
increase levels or toxicity of phenytoin, lithium, and warfarin. Phenobarbital and rifampin may
increase metronidazole metabolism.
IV infusion must be given slowly over 1 hr. For intravenous use in all ages, some references recommend a 15-mg/kg loading dose.

No dosing adjustments are required based on race or gender, or in patients with severe renal
dysfunction or mild to moderate hepatic function impairment. Effect of severe hepatic function
impairment on micafungin pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated. Higher dosage requirements
in premature and young infants may be attributed to the faster drug clearance due to lower protein
binding. Higher treatment doses in infants and children have been reported at 8.6–12 mg/kg/dose
IV once daily.
May cause GI disturbances, phlebitis, rash, hyperbilirubinemia, liver function test elevation, headache, fever, and rigor. Anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, TEN, Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, and hemolysis have been reported. Micafungin is CYP450 3A isoenzyme substrate and
weak inhibitor. May increase the effects/toxicity of nifedipine and sirolimus.
Safety and efficacy in children ≥4 mo have been demonstrated based on well-controlled studies and

sedation that is uncharacteristic of the patient during a seizure episode. Max. dose: 10 mg/dose
per episode; not to exceed one episode every 3 days and 5 episodes per month.
Contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and shock. Use with caution in
CHF, renal impairment (adjust dose; see Chapter 31), pulmonary disease, hepatic
dysfunction, and neonates. Causes respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia.
Cardiovascular monitoring is recommended. Use lower doses or reduce dose when given in
combination with narcotics or in patients with respiratory compromise.
Higher recommended dosage for younger patients (6 mo–5 yr) is attributed to the water-soluble
properties of midazolam and the higher percent body water for younger patients.
Drug is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4. Serum concentrations may be increased by cimetidine, clarithromycin, diltiazem, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ranitidine, and protease inhibitors (use
contraindicated). Sedative effects may be antagonized by theophylline. Effects can be reversed
by flumazenil. For pharmacodynamic information, see Chapter 6.

MOMETASONE FUROATE ± FOMOTEROL FUMARATE continued
Mometasone is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate; concurrent administration with ketoconazole and other
CYP 450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors) may increase mometasone levels, resulting
in Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Blurred vision, cataracts, and glaucoma have
been reported. Use with caution with hepatic impairment; increased drug exposure is possible.
INTRANASAL: Clear nasal passages and shake nasal spray well before each use. Onset of action for
nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 11 hr after the first dose. Nasal
burning and irritation may occur. Nasal septal perforation and taste and smell disturbances have
been rarely reported. A clinical trial in children 6–17 yr old was not able to demonstrate effectiveness for treating nasal polyps.
ORAL INHALATION (all forms): Rinse mouth after each use. Fever, allergic rhinitis, URI, UTI, GI discomfort,
and sore throat have been reported in children. Musculoskeletal pain, oral candidiasis, arthralgia, and
fatigue may occur. May potentially worsen tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infection, or
ocular herpes simplex. Do not use Asmanex Twisthaler if allergic to milk proteins. The Twisthaler dosage
form requires a minimum 30–60 L/min inspiratory flow rate to assure proper dose delivery. Breast-feeding
information is currently unknown, but most experts consider use of inhaled corticosteroids acceptable.
MOMETASONE + FOMOTEROL (Dulera): Common side effects include nasopharyngitis, sinusitis,
and headache. Angioedema, anaphylaxis, and arrhythmias have been reported. See Formoterol for
additional remarks.
TOPICAL USE: HPA axis suppression and skin atrophy have been reported with cream and ointment
use in infants 6–23 mo. Avoid application/contact to face, eyes, underarms, groin, and mucous
membranes. Occlusive dressings and use in diaper dermatitis are not recommended.

Naloxone may be used to reverse effects, especially respiratory depression. Causes
histamine release resulting in itching and possible bronchospasm. Low-dose naloxone
infusion may be used for itching. Inflammatory masses (e.g., granulomas) have been
reported with continuous infusions via indwelling intrathecal catheters.
Dosage reduction may be necessary with liver cirrhosis. See Chapter 6 for equianalgesic dosing.
Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used for prolonged periods or in higher doses at term.
Rectal dosing is same as oral dosing but is not recommended due to poor absorption. Controlled/
sustained-release oral tablets must be administered whole. Controlled-release oral capsules may
be opened and the entire contents sprinkled on applesauce immediately prior to ingestion. Be
aware of the various oral solution concentrations; the concentrated oral solution (100 mg/5 mL)
has been associated with accidental overdoses. Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).
The FDA has assigned a REMS for Opioid Analgesia; see www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. The
REMS strongly encourages the (1) completion of a REMS-compliant education program; (2) counsel
patients/caregivers on prescription safe use, risks, storage, and disposal; (3) emphasize the
importance of reading the Medication Guide provided by pharmacists at all times; and (4) consider
other methods for improving patient, household, and community safety.

Delayed-release tabs (Myfortic): 720–1080 mg PO BID
­

Check specific transplantation protocol for specific dosage. Mycophenolate mofetil is a
prodrug for mycophenolic acid. Owing to differences in absorption, the delayed-release
tablets should not be interchanged with other oral-dosage forms on an equivalent
milligram-to-milligram basis. Increases risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and increased
risk of congenital malformations (especially external ear and facial abnormalities including
cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, and esophagus).
Common side effects may include headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, anemia, fever, opportunistic infections, and sepsis. May cause drowsiness and increase the risk
for bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections, and lymphomas or other malignancies. GI bleeds
and increased risk for rejection in heart transplant patients switched from calcineurin inhibitors
(e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and CellCept to sirolimus and CellCept have been reported. Cases
of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and hypogammaglobulinemia have also been reported.
Use of mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) should be avoided in patients with hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome)
because it may exacerbate disease symptoms characterized by increased uric acid leading to acute
arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis, and renal failure.
Use with caution in patients with active GI disease or renal impairment (GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2)
outside of the immediate posttransplant period. In adults with renal impairment, avoid doses >2
g/24 hr and observe carefully. Dose should be interrupted or reduced in the presence of neutropenia
(ANC <1.3 × 103/microliter). No dose adjustment is needed for patients experiencing delayed graft
function postoperatively.

Drug interactions: (1) Displacement of phenytoin or theophylline from protein-binding sites will
decrease total serum levels and increase free serum levels of these drugs. Salicylates displace
mycophenolate to increase free levels of mycophenolate. (2) Competition for renal tubular secretion
results in increased serum levels of acyclovir, ganciclovir, probenecid, and mycophenolate (when
any of these are used together). (3) Avoid live and live attenuated vaccines (including influenza);
decreases vaccine effectiveness. (4) Proton pump inhibitors, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, and telmisartan may reduce mycophenolate levels.
Administer oral doses on an empty stomach. Infuse intravenous doses over 2 hr. Oral suspension may
be administered via NG tube with a minimum size of 8 Fr.

Continuous infusion (child and adult): 0.005 mg/kg loading dose followed by infusion of 0.0025 mg/
kg/hr has been recommended. A range of 0.0025–0.16 mg/kg/hr has been reported. Taper gradually to avoid relapse.
Adult: 0.4–2 mg/dose. May repeat PRN Q2–3 min. Use 0.1- to 0.2-mg increments in opiate-dependent
patients.
Intranasal route for opiate intoxication (full reversal):
All ages: 4 mg (0.1 mL) of nasal liquid (Narcan) into one nostril Q2–3 min PRN in alternating nostrils.
Opioid-dependent patient at risk for opioid withdrawal: Use lower 2 mg (0.1 mL) nasal liquid (Narcan)
into one nostril Q2–3 min PRN in alternating nostrils. Alternatively, the 2 mg/2 mL intravenous (IV)
syringe dosage form with nasal adapter may be used by administering 1 mg (1 mL) per nostril.
Opiate-induced pruritus (limited data): 0.25–2 mCg/kg/hr IV; a dose-finding study in 59 children
suggests a minimal dose of 1 mCg/kg/hr when used as prophylactic therapy. Doses ≥3 mCg/kg/hr
increases the risk for reduced pain control.
­

Short duration of action may necessitate multiple doses. For severe intoxication, doses of 0.2
mg/kg may be required. If no response is achieved after a cumulative dose of 10 mg,
reevaluate diagnosis. In the nonarrest situation, use the lowest dose effective (may
start at 0.001 mg/kg/dose). See Chapter 6 for additional information.
Will produce narcotic withdrawal syndrome in patients with chronic dependence. Use with caution in
patients with chronic cardiac disease. Abrupt reversal of narcotic depression may result in nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and tremulousness. Aggressive behavior has
been reported in abrupt reversal of an opioid overdose. False-positive test for urine opiates screen
may occur.
IV administration is preferred. Onset of action may be delayed with other routes of administration.

Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Contraindicated in moderate/
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) and postexposure (occupational or
nonoccupational) prophylactic regimens. Most frequent side effects with continuous therapy
include skin rash (may be life-threatening, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and DRESS;
permanently discontinue and never restart), fever, abnormal liver function tests, headache, and
nausea. Discontinue therapy if any of the following occurs: severe rash; rash with fever, blistering,
oral lesions, conjunctivitis or muscle aches. Permanently discontinue and do not restart therapy if
symptomatic hepatitis, severe transaminase elevations or hypersensitivity reactions occur.
Life-threatening hepatotoxicity has been reported primarily during the first 12 wk of continuous
therapy. Patients with increased serum transaminase or a history of hepatitis B or C infection prior
to nevirapine are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity. Women, including pregnant women, with CD4 cell
counts >250/mm3 or men with CD4 cell counts >400/mm3 are at risk for hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver
function tests (obtain transaminases immediately after development of hepatitis signs/symptoms,
hypersensitivity reactions, or rash) and complete blood counts. Hypophosphatemia has been reported.
Nevirapine induces the CYP 450 3A4 drug metabolizing isoenzyme to cause an autoinduction of its
own metabolism within the first 2–4 wk of therapy and has the potential to interact with many
drugs. Carefully review the patient’s drug profile for other drug interactions each time nevirapine is initiated or when a new drug is added to a regimen containing nevirapine.
Doses can be administered with food and concurrently with didanosine.

a max. dose of 15 mg/hr. Following attainment of desired BP, decrease infusion to 3 mg/hr and
adjust rate as needed to maintain desired response.
Reported use in children has been limited to a small number of preterm infants, infants, and
children.
Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis. Avoid systemic hypotension in patients following
an acute cerebral infarct or hemorrhage. Use with caution in hepatic or renal dysfunction by
carefully titrating dose. The drug undergoes significant first-pass metabolism through the liver and
is excreted in the urine (60%). Use caution when converting to another dosage form; they are NOT
equivalent on a milligram-per-milligram basis.
May cause headache, dizziness, asthenia, peripheral edema, and GI symptoms. Nicardipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A and inhibitor of CYP 450 2 C9/19. Cimetidine increases the effects/toxicity of
nicardipine. Nicardipine may increase effect/toxicity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. See Nifedipine
for additional drug and food interactions.
Onset of action for orally administered drug is 20 min with peak effects in 0.5 to 2 hr. Onset of action
of intravenously administered drug is 1 min. Duration of action following a single IV or PO dose is
3 hr. To reduce the risk for venous thrombosis, phlebitis, and vascular impairment with IV administration, do not use small veins (e.g., dorsum of hand or wrist). Avoid intra-arterial administration

­

Use of immediate-release dosage form in children is controversial and has been abandoned
by many. Use with caution in children with acute CNS injury due to increased risk for
stroke, seizure, hepatic impairment, and altered level of consciousness. To prevent rapid
decrease in blood pressure in children, an initial dose of ≤0.25 mg/kg is recommended.
Use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis, GI obstruction/
narrowing (bezoar formation), and cirrhosis (reduced drug clearance). May cause severe hypotension, peripheral edema, flushing, tachycardia, headaches, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, and
syncope. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been reported.
Although overall use in adults has been abandoned, the immediate-release dosage form is
contraindicated in adults with severe obstructive coronary artery disease or recent MI and in
hypertensive emergencies.
Nifedipine is a substrate for CYP 450 3A3/4, and 3A5-7. Do not administer with grapefruit juice; may
increase bioavailability and effects. Itraconazole and ketoconazole may increase nifedipine levels
and/or effects. CYP 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) may reduce nifedipine’s effects. Nifedipine may increase phenytoin, cyclosporine, and digoxin
levels. For hypertensive emergencies, see Chapter 4.
For sublingual (SL) administration, capsule must be punctured and liquid expressed into the
patient’s mouth. A small amount is absorbed via the SL route. Most effects are due to swallowing
and oral absorption. Do not crush or chew sustained-release tablet dosage form.

Contraindicated in glaucoma, with increased ICP, cerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain
injury, shock, severe anemia, concurrent phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil),
and concurrent guanylate cyclase stimulator (e.g., riociguat). In small doses (1–2 mCg/kg/
min) acts mainly on systemic veins and decreases preload. At 3–5 mCg/kg/min acts on
systemic arterioles to decrease resistance. May cause headache, flushing, hypersensitivity
reactions, hypotension, GI upset, blurred vision, and methemoglobinemia. Use with caution
in severe renal impairment, and hepatic failure. IV nitroglycerin may antagonize
anticoagulant effect of heparin.
Decrease dose gradually in patients receiving drug for prolonged periods to avoid withdrawal reaction. Must use polypropylene infusion sets to avoid adsorption of drug to plastic tubing. Use in
heparized patients may result in a decrease of PTT with subsequent rebound effect on discontinuation of nitroglycerin.
Onset (duration) of action: IV: 1–2 min (3–5 min); sublingual: 1–3 min (30–60 min); PO sustained

See imipramine for contraindications and common side effects. Also contraindicated with
linezolid or IV methylene blue due to increased risk for serotonin syndrome. Avoid use in
patients with Brugada syndrome. Fewer CNS and anticholinergic side effects than with
amitriptyline. May cause mild pupillary dilation, which can lead to narrow angle glaucoma.
Lower doses and slower dose titration are recommended in hepatic impairment. Therapeutic antidepressant effects occur in 7–21 days. Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after dose changes. Do not discontinue abruptly.
Nortriptyline is a substrate for the CYP 450 1A2 and 2D6 drug-metabolizing enzymes. Use and
dosing considerations have been recommended based on the following CYP 450 2D6 phenotypes:
Ultrarapid metabolizer: Use of alternative drug not metabolized by CYP 2D6. If use warranted, titrate
to the highest target dose and monitor serum levels.
Intermediate metabolizer: Reduce recommended initial dose by 25% and monitor serum levels.
Poor metabolizer: Avoid use to prevent potential side effect and use alternative drug not metabolized by
CYP 2D6. If use is warranted, reduce recommended initial dose by 50% and monitor serum levels.
Rifampin may increase the metabolism of nortriptyline.
Therapeutic nortriptyline levels for depression: 50–150 ng/mL. Recommended serum sampling time:
obtain a single level 8 or more hours after an oral dose (following 4 days of continuous dosing for
children and after 9–10 days for adults).

Corneal ulcer: 1–2 drops to affected eye(s) Q30 min while awake and Q4–6 hr while asleep at
night × 2 days, followed by Q1 hr while awake × 5 days, and then QID until treatment has been
completed.
Pruritus, local irritation, taste perversion, dizziness, earache have been reported with otic
use. Ocular burning/discomfort is frequent with ophthalmic use. Consult with
ophthalmology in corneal ulcers.
When otic solution is being used, the solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for
1–2 min. The use of cold solutions may result in dizziness. For otitis externa, the patient should lie
with the affected ear upward before instillation and remain in the same position after dose administration for 5 min to enhance drug delivery. For acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes, the
patient should lie in the same position prior to instillation and the tragus should be pumped 4
times after the dose to assist in drug delivery to the middle ear.
Systemic use of ofloxacin is typically replaced by levofloxacin, its S-isomer, which has a more favorable side effect profile than ofloxacin. See levofloxacin.

Use with caution in cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hypotensive conditions,
diabetes/hyperglycemia, elevated serum lipids and cholesterol, paralytic ileus, hepatic
impairment, seizure disorders, narrow angle glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy.
Medication exhibits anticholinergic effects.
Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, hyperprolactinemia, appetite simulation, weight gain (greater in adolescents than adults; monitoring
is recommended), hypertriglyceridemia, constipation, xerostomia, akathisia, asthenia, dizziness,
somnolence, tremor, and personality disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, dystonia, cognitive
and motor impairment, tardive dyskinesia (irreversible with cumulative high doses), neutropenia,
leukopenia, agranulocytosis, suicidal intent, acute pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, increases in
liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT), DRESS, and hyperthermia have been reported.
Olanzapine is a major substate for CYP 450 1A2 and minor substrate for 2D6. It also is a weak inhibitor to CYP 450 1A2, 2C9/19. Do not use in combination with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opiates
due to increased risk for sedation and cardiopulmonary depression. Caution is also indicated
with anticholinergic agents (e.g., azelastine, glycopyrrolate), as olanzapine may enhance the
anticholinergic effects. Use with QTc-prolonging medications may further increase the risk for QTc
prolongation. Metoclopramide may enhance neurological side effects of olanzapine. Do not use oral
disintegrating tablets in phenylketonuria.
T½: 37 hr for children and 21–54 hr for adults via PO route. Short-acting IM T½ in adults is similar to
PO route but long-acting IM T½ is ∼30 days in adults.
Maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia has not been systematically evaluated in adolescents. Therefore it is recommended to utilize the lowest dose to maintain efficacy and
to reassess the need for maintenance treatment periodically for this age group.

have been reported. Fundic gland polyps has been associated with long-term use of PPIs.
Has been associated with increased risk for Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea.
Drug induces CYP 450 1A2 (decreases theophylline levels) and is also a substrate and inhibitor of CYP
2C19. Recommended dosage modification for ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 2C19 is to increase the
usual dose by threefold. Increases T½ of citalopram, diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin. May decrease
the effects of itraconazole, ketoconazole, clopidogrel, iron salts, and ampicillin esters. St. John’s wort
and rifampin may decrease omeprazole effects. May be used in combination with clarithromycin and
amoxicillin for Helicobacter pylori infections. Omeprazole may interfere with serum chromogranin A
(CgA) diagnostic test for neuroendocrine tumors; discontinue use at least 14 days prior to testing.
Bioavailability may be increased with hepatic dysfunction or in patients of Asian descent. Safety and
efficacy for GERD in children <1 mo have not been established.
Administer all doses before meals. Administer 30 min prior to sucralfate. Capsules contain entericcoated granules to ensure bioavailability. Do not chew or crush capsule. For doses unable to be
divided by 10 mg, capsule may be opened and intact pellets may be administered in an acidic
beverage (e.g., apple juice, cranberry juice) or applesauce. The extemporaneously compounded oral

Avoid use in congenital long-QTc syndrome. Bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypokalemia,
seizures, headaches, lightheadedness, constipation, diarrhea and transient increases in
AST, ALT, and bilirubin may occur. Transient blindness (resolution within a few min up to
48 hr), arthralgia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN, hepatic dysfunction, and rare/transient
ECG changes (including QTc-interval prolongation) have been reported. Data limited for
use in children below 3 yr of age.
ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, or bradyarrhythmias. Drug clearance is higher for surgical and cancer patients <18 yr as compared with adults.
Clearance is slower for children 1–4 mo old compared with children >4–24 mo old.
Ondansetron is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A3/4 drug metabolizing enzymes. It is
likely that the inhibition/loss of one of the previously listed enzymes will be compensated by others
and may result in insignificant changes to the elimination of ondansetron, which may be affected
by CYP 450 enzyme inducers. Ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP 450 2D6 is associated with decreased
response and use of an alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP 2D6 (e.g.,
granisetron) is recommended. Follow theophylline, phenytoin, or warfarin levels closely, if used in
combination. Use with apomorphine may result in profound hypotension and loss of consciousness
and is contraindicated.
To administer the oral film dosage form (Zuplenz), film must be placed on top of patient’s tongue,
allowed to dissolve completely in 4–20 sec, and swallowed with or without liquid.

within 2 days of exposure.
Currently indicated for the treatment of influenza A and B strains. Use in children <1 yr of
age has not been recommended due to concerns of excessive CNS penetration and
fatalities in 7-day-old rats.
Nausea and vomiting generally occur within the first 2 days and are the most common adverse
effects. Insomnia, vertigo, seizures, hypothermia, neuropsychiatric events (may result in fatal
outcomes), arrhythmias, rash, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. If the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 10–30 mL/min, reduce treatment dose to 75 mg PO once daily
× 5 days for adults. (See Chapter 31.)
PROPHYLACTIC USE: Oseltamivir is not a substitute for annual flu vaccination. Safety and efficacy
have been demonstrated for ≤6 wk of therapy; duration of protection lasts for as long as dosing
is continued. Adjust prophylaxis dose if GFR is 10–30 mL/min by extending the dosage interval to
once every other day.
Probenecid increases oseltamivir levels. Oseltamivir decreases the efficacy of the nasal influenza
vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist); avoid administration of vaccine within 2 wk
before or 48 hr after oseltamivir administration unless medically indicated.
Dosage adjustments in hepatic impairment, severe renal disease, and dialysis have not been

Adult:
Adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures: Start with 600 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Dose may be
increased at weekly intervals, as clinically indicated, by a maximum of 600 mg/24 hr. Usual maintenance dose is 1200 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Doses ≥2400 mg/24 hr are generally not well tolerated
due to CNS side effects.
Conversion to monotherapy for partial-onset seizures: Start with 600 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID and
simultaneously initiate dosage reduction of concomitant AEDs. Dose may be increased at weekly
intervals as clinically indicated, by a max of 600 mg/24 hr to achieve a dose of 2400 mg/24 hr PO
÷ BID. Concomitant AEDs should be terminated gradually over approximately 3–6 wk.
Initiation of monotherapy for partial-onset seizures: Start with 600 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID. Then
increase by 300 mg/24 hr every 3 days up to 1200 mg/24 hr PO ÷ BID.
EXTENDED RELEASE TABS (Oxtellar XR; see remarks):
Child 6–17 yr of age:
Adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures: Start with 8–10 mg/kg/24 hr PO once daily up to a
max. dose of 600 mg/24 hr. Then gradually increase at weekly intervals in increments of 8–10
mg/kg/24 hr (max. dosage increment: 600 mg) to the following maintenance doses:
20–29 kg: 900 mg PO once daily
29.1–39 kg: 1200 mg PO once daily
≥39.1 kg: 1800 mg PO once daily
Adult:
Adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures: Start with 600 mg PO once daily (consider using
900 mg if patient is receiving concomitant enzyme-inducing AEDs). Then gradually increase at
weekly intervals in 600 mg/24 hr increments to the maintenance dose of 1200–2400 mg once
daily.

Clinically significant hyponatremia may occur; generally seen within the first 3 mo of
therapy. May also cause headache, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus,
urticaria, diplopia, abnormal gait, and GI discomfort. About 25%–30% of patients with
carbamazepine hypersensitivity will experience a cross reaction with oxcarbazepine.
Serious dermatologic reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and TEN), multiorgan
hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., DRESS), bone marrow depression, osteoporosis,
pancreatitis, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, rare cases of anaphylaxis and
angioedema, and suicidal behavior or ideation have been reported. Increased risk for
severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., SJS and TEN) has been associated with the HLAB*1502 (prevalent among persons of Asian descent) alleles.

Inhibits CYP 450 2C19 and induces CYP 450 3A4/5 drug metabolizing enzymes. Carbamazepine,
cyclosporine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, valproic acid and verapamil may decrease oxcarbazepine levels. Oxcarbazepine may increase phenobarbital and phenytoin levels. Oxcarbazepine
can decrease the effects of oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, felodipine, and lamotrigine.
If GFR <30 mL/min, adjust dosage by administering 50% of the normal starting dose (max. dose:
300 mg/24 hr) followed by a slower than normal increase in dose if necessary (see Chapter 31). No
dosage adjustment is required in mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Use is not recommended in
severe hepatic impairment due to lack of information.
Extended release and immediate release products are not bioequivalent, as higher doses of the

There is a potential for abuse; CNS and respiratory depression, increased ICP, histamine
release, constipation, and GI distress may occur. Use with caution in severe renal
impairment (increases T½) and mild/moderate hepatic dysfunction (use of one-third to
one-half of usual dose has been recommended). Naloxone is the antidote. See Chapter 6
for equianalgesic dosing. Check dosages of acetaminophen or aspirin when using
combination products (e.g., Percocet, Percodan). Oxycodone is metabolized by the CYP 450
3A4 (major) and 2D6 (minor) isoenzyme.
When controlled-released tablets (e.g., Oxycontin) are being used, determine patient’s total 24-hr
requirement should be determined and divided by 2 to administer on a Q12 hr dosing interval.
Oxycontin 80-mg tablet is USED ONLY for opioid-tolerant patients; this strength can cause fatal
respiratory depression in opioid-naive patients. Controlled-release dosage form should not be used

RSV season typically November through April in the northern hemisphere but may begin
earlier or persist later in certain communities. IM is currently the only route of
administration, so use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation
disorder. The following adverse effects have been reported at slightly higher incidences
when compared with placebo: rhinitis, rash, pain, increased liver enzymes, pharyngitis,
cough, wheeze, diarrhea, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and anemia. Rare acute hypersensitivity
reactions have been reported (first or subsequent doses).
Does not interfere with the response to routine childhood vaccines. May interfere with immunologicbased RSV diagnostic tests (some antigen detection–based assays and viral culture assays) but
not with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays.
Palivizumab is currently indicated for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants only. Efficacy and safety
have not been demonstrated for treatment of RSV.
Cardiopulmonary bypass and ECMO will significantly reduce serum concentrations; administer a dose
immediately after the bypass procedure or ECMO even if it is <1 mo from the previous dose.
Each dose should be administered IM in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. It is recommended to
divide doses with total injection volumes >1 mL. Avoid injection in the gluteal muscle because of
risk for damage to the sciatic nerve.

May cause occult GI bleeding, allergic reactions to porcine proteins, hyperuricemia, and
hyperuricosuria with high doses. Dose should be titrated to eliminate diarrhea and to
minimize steatorrhea. Do not chew microspheres or microtabs. Concurrent administration
with H2 antagonists or gastric acid pump inhibitors may enhance enzyme efficacy. Doses
higher than 6000 U lipase/kg/meal have been associated with colonic strictures in children
<12 yr. Nonenteric coated dosage forms (e.g., powder and tablet) are not preferred, owing
to potential GI mucosal ulceration. Patients who are unable to swallow capsules intact
may mix the contents with small amount of acidic soft foods (pH ≤4.5; such as
applesauce) and swallow immediately after mixing.
Avoid use of generic pancreatic enzyme products because they been associated with treatment failures. Products not approved by the FDA are no longer allowed to be distributed in the United States.

GI disturbance, hematuria, rash, ototoxicity, and hypocholesterolemia. Bacterial overgrowth
of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi, may occur. May decrease the effects of
digoxin.

Contraindicated in patients taking MAO inhibitors (within 14 days of discontinuing MAO
inhibitors), linezolid, methylene blue, pimozide, or thioridazine. Use with caution in
patients with history of seizures, renal or hepatic impairment, cardiac disease, suicidal
concerns, mania/hypomania, concurrent use with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans,
fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, amphetamines, or St. John’s Wort), and diuretic use. Patients
with severe renal or hepatic impairment should initiate therapy at 10 mg/24 hr and
increase dose as needed up to a max. of 40 mg/24 hr.
Common side effects include anxiety, nausea, anorexia, and decreased appetite. Monitor for clinical
worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of therapy or after
dose changes. Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported.
Paroxetine is an inhibitor and substrate for CYP 450 2D6. Ultrametabolizers of CYP 2D6 should avoid
use of paroxetine and use an alternative medication not metabolized by this enzyme system. A 50%
initial dose reduction for poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers has been recommended. May increase the
effects/toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and warfarin. May decrease the effects
of tamoxifen. Cimetidine, ritonavir, MAO inhibitors (fatal serotonin syndrome), dextromethorphan,
phenothiazines, and type 1C antiarrhythmics may increase the effect/toxicity of paroxetine.
Weakness, hyperreflexia, and poor coordination have been reported when taken with sumatriptan.
Do not discontinue therapy abruptly; may cause sweating, dizziness, confusion, and tremor. May be
taken with or without food.

Contraindicated in porphyria, severe respiratory disease with dyspnea, or obstruction.
Use with caution in hepatic or renal disease (reduce dose). IV administration may cause
respiratory arrest or hypotension. Side effects include drowsiness, cognitive impairment,
ataxia, hypotension, hepatitis, rash, respiratory depression, apnea, megaloblastic anemia,
and anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. Paradoxic reaction in children (not dose
related) may cause hyperactivity, irritability, or insomnia. Induces several liver enzymes
(CYP 450 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8/9, 3A4), P-glycoprotein, and glucoronidation (UGT1A1),
thus decreases blood levels of many drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants). IV push not to exceed
1 mg/kg/min.
T½ is variable with age: neonates, 45–100 hr; infants, 20–133 hr; children, 37–73 hr. Owing to long
half-life, consider other agents for sedation for procedures.
Therapeutic levels: 15–40 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: trough level
obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 10–14 days of continuous dosing.

Drug Dosages

973

Contraindicated in patients with heart block or sinus bradycardia; those who are receiving
delavirdine (decrease virologic response); and history of hydantoin hypersensitivity. Use
with caution in patients with pacemakers or cardiac dysrhythmias because of its class IB
antiarrhythmic properties. IM administration is not recommended because of erratic
absorption and pain at injection site; consider fosphenytoin. Side effects include gingival
hyperplasia, hirsutism, dermatitis, blood dyscrasia, ataxia, lupus-like and Stevens-Johnson
syndromes, lymphadenopathy, liver damage, and nystagmus. Suicidal behavior or ideation,
bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and multiorgan hypersensitivity (DRESS) have been reported.
An increased risk for serious skin reactions (e.g., TEN and Stevens-Johnson) may occur in
patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele; do not use this medication in individuals who carry
this genotype.
Many drug interactions: levels may be increased by cimetidine, chloramphenicol, INH, sulfonamides,
trimethoprim, etc. Levels may be decreased by some antineoplastic agents. Phenytoin induces
hepatic microsomal enzymes (CYP 450 1A2, 2C8/9/19, and 3A3/4), leading to decreased effectiveness of oral contraceptives, fosamprenavir (used without ritonavir), quinidine, valproic acid,
theophylline, and other substrates to the previously listed CYP 450 hepatic enzymes. May increase
levels of amprenavir when administered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir. May cause resistance
to neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g.,
pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium) and decrease concentrations of T4 and
T3 (typically without clinical hypothyroidism).
The following initial maintenance dose modifications for HLA-B*1502 allele noncarriers and CYP 450
2C9 phenotypes have been recommended:
CYP 2C9 intermediate metabolizer: 25% reduction with therapeutic drug monitoring
CYP 2C9 poor metabolizer: 50% reduction with therapeutic drug monitoring
Ideal body weight should be used for calculating dosages. Suggested dosing intervals for specific
oral dosage forms: extended release caps (once daily–BID); chewable tablets, and oral suspension
(TID). Oral absorption reduced in neonates. T½ is variable (7–42 hr) and dose dependent. Drug is
highly protein bound; free fraction of drug will be increased in patients with hypoalbuminemia.
For seizure disorders, therapeutic levels: 10–20 mg/L (free and bound phenytoin) OR 1–2 mg/L (free
only). Monitor free phenytoin levels in hypoalbuminemia or renal insufficiency. Recommended
serum sampling times: trough level (PO/IV) within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose; peak
or postload level (IV) 1 hr after the end of IV infusion. Steady state is usually achieved after 5–10
days of continuous dosing. For routine monitoring, measure trough.
IV push/infusion rate: Not to exceed 0.5 mg/kg/min in neonates, or 1 mg/kg/min infants, children,
and adults with maximum of 50 mg/min; may cause cardiovascular collapse. Consider fosphenytoin in situations of tenuous IV access and risk for extravasation.

Status epilepticus: See Chapter 1 and remarks.
Loading dose (all ages): 20 mg/kg IV; max. dose: 1500 mg/24 hr
Maintenance for seizure disorders (initiate 12 hr after administration of loading dose):
Neonate: start with 5 mg/kg/24 hr PO/IV ÷ Q12 hr; usual range 4–8 mg/kg/24 hr PO/IV ÷ Q8–12 hr.
Infant/child: start with 5 mg/kg/24 hr ÷ BID–TID PO/IV; usual dose range (doses divided BID–TID):

Tazobactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor, thus extending the spectrum of piperacillin. Like other
penicillins, CSF penetration occurs only with inflamed meninges. GI disturbances, pruritus,
rash, and headaches are common. Abnormal platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding,
serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson, DRESS, acute generalized exanthematous
pustulosis, and TEN) have been reported. Cystic fibrosis patients have an increased risk
for fever and rash. Increases in renal failure risk (in critically ill adults) and incidence of
acute kidney injury (in combination with IV vancomycin) have been reported.
Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly with high doses of heparin,
warfarin, or other drugs affecting blood coagulation or thrombocyte function. May falsely decrease aminoglycoside serum levels if the drugs are infused close to one another; allow a minimum of 2 hr between
infusions to prevent this interaction. May prolong the neuromuscular blockade effects of vecuronium.
Prolonging the dose administration time to 4 hr will maximize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
properties by prolonging the time of drug concentration above the MIC; especially for pathogens
with piperacillin MICs of 8–16 mCg/mL. Adjust dose in renal impairment, (see Chapter 31).

See Chapter 10 for physiologic replacement, relative steroid potencies, and doses based on
body surface area. Methylprednisolone is preferable in hepatic disease because prednisone
must be converted to methylprednisolone in the liver.
Side effects may include: mood changes, seizures, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal
distension, GI bleeding, HPA axis suppression, osteopenia, cushingoid effects, and cataracts with
prolonged use. Prednisone is a CYP 450 3A3/4 substrate and inducer. Barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and isoniazid may reduce the effects of prednisone, whereas estrogens
may enhance the effects. Pregnancy category changes to “D” if used in the first trimester.

Use with caution in renal or hepatic disease and pulmonary insufficiency. Primidone is
metabolized to phenobarbital and has the same drug interactions and toxicities (see
Phenobarbital). In addition, primidone may cause vertigo, nausea, leukopenia, malignant
lymphoma-like syndrome, diplopia, nystagmus, and systemic lupus-like syndrome. Monitor
for suicidal behavior or ideation. Acetazolamide may decrease primidone absorption. Adjust
dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31).

Contraindicated in asthma, Raynaud syndrome, heart failure, and heart block. Not indicated
for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Use with caution in presence of obstructive
lung disease, diabetes mellitus, or renal or hepatic disease. May cause hypoglycemia,
hypotension, nausea, vomiting, depression, weakness, impotence, bronchospasm, and
heart block. Cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson, TEN, exfoliative dermatitis,
erythema multiforme, and urticaria have been reported. Acute hypertension has occurred
after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients on propranolol.
Therapeutic levels for beta-blockade: 50–100 ng/mL; ventricular arrhythmia: 40–85 ng/mL. Drug is
metabolized by CYP 450 1A2, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 isoenzymes. Concurrent administration with barbiturates, indomethacin, or rifampin may cause decreased activity of propranolol. Concurrent administration
with cimetidine, hydralazine, flecainide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, or verapamil may lead to increased
activity of propranolol. Avoid IV use of propranolol with calcium channel blockers; may increase effect of
calcium channel blocker. Use with amiodarone may increase negative chronotropic effects.
For infantile hemangioma, monitor BP and HR 2 hr after initiating therapy and after dose increases.
To reduce risk of hypoglycemia, administer doses during or right after a feeding; hold doses if
child is not eating or is vomiting. Infants <6 mo must be fed every 4 hr. Common adverse effects
(>10%) reported in clinical trials with Hemangeol include sleep disorders, aggravated respiratory
tract infections (e.g., bronchitis and bronchiolitis) associated with cough/fever, diarrhea, and
vomiting. Readjust dose periodically with changes (increases) in child’s body weight.

Pyrimethamine is a folate antagonist. Supplementation with folinic acid leucovorin at 5–15
mg/24 hr is recommended. Contraindicated in megaloblastic anemia secondary to folate
deficiency. Use with caution in G6PD deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism,
pregnancy, and renal or hepatic impairment. Pyrimethamine can cause glossitis, bone
marrow suppression, seizures, rash, and photosensitivity. For congenital toxoplasmosis,
see Clin Infect Dis 1994;18:38–72. Zidovudine and methotrexate may increase risk for
bone marrow suppression. Aurothioglucose, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole may
increase risk for blood dyscrasias. Administer doses with meals. Most cases of acquired
toxoplasmosis do not require specific antimicrobial therapy.
Outpatient prescriptions may need to be processed through a specialty pharmacy program via the
manufacturer; see http://www.daraprimdirect.com/healthcare-providers.

QUETIAPINE continued
Do not abruptly discontinue medication as acute withdrawal symptoms occur. Dosage adjustment in
hepatic impairment may be necessary as it is primarily hepatically metabolized. Quetiapine is a
major substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and minor substrate for 2D6. Opioids and other CNS depressants
may enhance CNS depressant effects. Carbamazepine may decrease the effects of quetiapine.
Quetiapine may decrease dopamine agonist effects (e.g., anti-parkinson agents) but may enhance
the anticholinergic and QTc prolongation effects to those medications processing these risks.
Always check for drug interactions as effects can be mild to severe.
Non–extended release dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Extended-release tabs
must be swallowed whole and administered preferably in the evening without food (a light meal
of ≤300 calories is allowed). May convert patients from immediate-release to extended-release
tablets at the equivalent total daily dose and administer once daily; individual dosage adjustments
may be necessary.

Quinidine is a substrate of CYP 450 3A3/4 and 3A5–7 enzymes, and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2D6 and
3A3/4 enzymes. Can cause increase in digoxin levels. Quinidine potentiates the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents, beta blockers, anticholinergics, and warfarin. Amiodarone, antacids,
delavirdine, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, saquinavir, ritonavir, verapamil, or cimetidine may enhance
the drug’s effect. Barbiturates, phenytoin, cholinergic drugs, nifedipine, sucralfate, or rifampin
may reduce quinidine’s effect. Use with caution in renal insufficiency (15%–25% of drug is
eliminated unchanged in the urine), myocardial depression, sick sinus syndrome, G6PD deficiency,
and hepatic dysfunction.
Therapeutic levels (antiarrhythmic): 3–7 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling times at steady
state: trough level obtained within 30 min prior to the next scheduled dose after 1–2 days of
continuous dosing (steady state).
MALARIA USE: Continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and serum glucose is
recommended, especially in pregnant women and young children.

inflammation and edema at the intravenous infusion site, thrombophlebitis, and
thrombosis, GI disturbances, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, increased liver enzymes,
hyperbilirubinemia, and headache. Dose frequency reductions (Q 8 hr–Q 12 hr) or
discontinuation can improve severe cases of arthralgia and myalgia. Use total body weight
for obese patients when calculating dosages.
Drug is an inhibitor to the CYP 450 3A4 isoenzyme. Avoid use with CYP 450 3A4 substrates, which
can prolong QTc interval. May increase the effects/toxicity of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus,
delavirdine, nevirapine, indinavir, ritonavir, diazepam, midazolam, carbamazepine, methylprednisolone, vinca alkaloids, docetaxel, paclitaxel, quinidine and some calcium channel blockers.

ORAL RIBAVIRIN: Contraindicated in pregnancy, significant or unstable cardiac disease,
autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic decompensation (Child-Pugh score >6; class B or C),
hemoglobinopathies, and creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Use with caution in
preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary disease and sarcoidosis. Anemia (most common),
insomnia, depression, irritability, and suicidal behavior (higher in adolescent and pediatric
patients) have been reported with the oral route.
Combination therapy with peginterferon for Hep C is no longer recommended due to poor efficacy.
Tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and homicidal ideation have been
reported in combination with interferon. Pancytopenia has been reported in combination with
interferon and azathioprine. Increased risk for hepatic decompensation with cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C patients treated with α interferons or with HIV coinfection receiving HAART and interferon
alfa-2a. Growth inhibition (delays in weight and height increases) was observed in children (5–17
years old) receiving combination therapy for up to 48 weeks.
May decrease the effects of zidovudine, stavudine; and increase risk for lactic acidosis with nucleoside analogues. Reduce or discontinue dosage for toxicity as follows:
Patient with no cardiac disease:
Hgb < 10 g/dL and ≥8.5 g/dL:
Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily
Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM
(tablets)
Hgb < 8.5 g/dL: Discontinue therapy permanently.
Patient with cardiac disease:
≥2 mg/dL decrease in Hgb during any 4-week period during therapy:
Child: 12 mg/kg/dose PO once daily; may further reduce to 8 mg/kg/dose PO once daily
(monitor weekly)
Adult: 600 mg PO once daily (capsules or solution) or 200 mg PO QAM and 400 mg PO QPM
(tablets)
Hgb < 12 g/dL after 4 weeks of reduced dose: Discontinue therapy permanently
INHALED RIBAVIRIN: Use of ribavirin for RSV is controversial and not routinely indicated. Aerosol
therapy may be considered for selected infants and young children at high risk for serious RSV
disease (see most recent edition of the AAP Redbook). Most effective if begun early in course
of RSV infection; generally in the first 3 days. May cause worsening respiratory distress, rash,
conjunctivitis, mild bronchospasm, hypotension, anemia and cardiac arrest. Avoid unnecessary
occupational exposure to ribavirin due to its teratogenic effects. Drug can precipitate in the
respiratory equipment.

Never use as monotherapy except when used for prophylaxis. Patients with latent tuberculosis
infection should NOT be treated with rifampin and pyrazinamide because of the risk of severe
liver injury. Use is NOT recommended in porphyria. Use with caution in diabetes.
May cause GI irritation, allergy, headache, fatigue, ataxia, muscle weakness, confusion, fever, hepatitis,
transient LFT abnormalities, blood dyscrasias, interstitial nephritis, and elevated BUN and uric acid.
Causes red discoloration of body secretions such as urine, saliva and tears (which can permanently
stain contact lenses). Bleeding and vitamin K–dependent coagulation disorders have been reported.
Induces several hepatic enzymes and transporters (CYP 450 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4; UGT1A1,
P-glycoprotein, and OATP1B1/1B3), which may decrease plasma concentration of digoxin, corticosteroids, buspirone, benzodiazepines, fentanyl, calcium channel blockers, β blockers, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, itraconazole, ketoconazole, oral anticoagulants, barbiturates, and theophylline. May reduce the
effectiveness of oral contraceptives and anti-retroviral agents (protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Use is contraindicated with praziquantel due to decreased praziquantel levels; rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks prior to initiating praziquantel and rifampin
can be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel. Hepatotoxicity is a concern when used in
combination with pyrazinamide and ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (use is contraindicated).
Adjust dose in renal failure (see Chapter 31). Reduce dose in hepatic impairment. Give oral doses 1
hr before or 2 hr after meals.
For Haemophilus influenzae type b prophylaxis, see latest edition of the Red Book.

Preferred over amantadine for influenza due to lower incidence of adverse events. Individuals
immunized with live attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist) should not receive rimantadine
prophylaxis for 14 days after the vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis does not interfere with immune
response to inactivated influenza vaccine.
May cause GI disturbance, xerostoma, dizziness, headache and urinary retention. CNS disturbances
are less than with amantadine. Contraindicated in amantadine hypersensitivity. Use with caution
in renal or hepatic insufficiency; dosage reduction may be necessary. A dosage reduction of 50%

Use with caution in cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, renal or hepatic impairment (dose
reduction necessary), hypothermia or hyperthermia, seizures, breast cancer or other prolactin
dependent tumors, and dysphagia. Common side effects include abdominal pain and other
GI disturbances, arthralgia, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence (use QHS
dosing), EPS, cough, fever, pharyngitis, rash, rhinitis, sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, and
weight gain. Weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue were common side effects reported in the
autism studies. Priapism, QTc prolongation, hypothermia, sleep apnea syndrome, sleep
walking, ileus, urinary retention, diabetes mellitus, and hypoglycemia have been reported in
post marketing reports. Very rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with use of the IM
dosage form in patients who have previously tolerated the oral dosage form.
In the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment or risk for hypotension, the following adult
dosing has been recommended: Start with 0.5 mg PO BID. Increase dose, if needed and tolerated,
in increments no more than 0.5 mg BID. Increases to doses >1.5 mg BID should occur at intervals
of at least 1 week; slower titration may be required in some patients.
Limited studies in pediatric related Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior in
psychiatric disorders are reported. Autistic disorder safety and efficacy in children <5 years of age
have not been established. If therapy has been discontinued for a period of time, therapy should be
reinitiated with the same initial titration regimen.
Drug is a CYP 450 2D6 and 3A4 isoenzyme substrate. Concurrent use of isoenzyme inhibitors (e.g.,
fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, cimetidine) and inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin) may increase and decrease the effects of risperidone, respectively. Alcohol,
CNS depressants, and St. John’s wort may potentiate the drug’s side effect. Risperidone may
enhance the hypotensive effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
Oral dosage forms may be administered with or without food. Oral solution can be mixed in water,
coffee, orange juice, or low-fat milk but is incompatible with cola or tea. Do not split or chew the
orally disintegrating tablet. Use IM suspension preparation within 6 hr after reconstitution.

Use with caution in hepatic impairment and history of anaphylaxis with other neuromuscular
blocking agents. Hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting,
bronchospasm, wheezing, hiccups, rash, and edema at the injection site may occur. Myopathy
after long-term use in an intensive care unit (ICU) and QT interval prolongation in pediatric
patients receiving general anesthetic agents have been reported. Severe anaphylactic reactions
and malignant hypothermia have been reported. Increased neuromuscular blockade may occur
with concomitant use of aminoglycosides, clindamycin, tetracycline, magnesium sulfate, quinine,
quinidine, succinylcholine and inhalation anesthetics (for continuous infusion, reduce infusion by
30%–50% at 45–60 min after intubating dose).
Caffeine, calcium, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenylephrine, azathioprine, and theophylline may
reduce neuromuscular blocking effects.
Use must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. Peak effects occur in 0.5–1 min for
children and in 1–3.7 min for adults. Duration of action: 30–40 min in children and 20–94 min in
adults (longer in geriatrics). Recovery time in children 3 months to 1 year of age is similar to that in
adults. To prevent residual paralysis, extubate patient only after the patient has sufficiently recovered

Contraindicated in Familial short-QT syndrome. Use is not recommended in severe hepatic
impairment (Child-Pugh 10–15). Use with caution when taking other medications that can
shorten the QT interval, performing tasks requiring mental alertness, and in mild/moderate
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 5–9).
Common side effects include fatigue, blurred vision, diplopia, ataxia, dizziness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting and shortening of cardiac QT interval. Serious side effects of leukopenia,
severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), multiorgan hypersensitivity
reactions (e.g., DRESS), and suicidal ideation have been reported.
Rufinamide is a weak inhibitor of CYP 450 2E1 and weak inducer of 3A4. May decrease levels/
effects of nifedipine, nimodipine, piperaquine, calcifediol, clozapine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine,
triazolam, orlistat, and hormonal contraceptives. May increase the levels/effects of phenytoin and
phenobarbital. Primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may decrease the levels/
effects of rufinamide. Whereas valproic acid may increase the levels/effects of rufinamide.
The effectiveness data for 1- to 4-year-old children is based on bridging pharmacokinetic (PK) and
safety data as their PK and safety data are similar to children ≥4 years old and adults.
Consider dose adjustment for drug loss in patients receiving hemodialysis (rufinamide is dialyzable).

Persistent asthma (see remarks):
≥4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation (50 mCg) Q 12 hr
Prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm:
≥4 yr and adult: 1 inhalation 30 to 60 min before exercise. Additional does should not be used for
another 12 hr. Patients who are already using 12-hr dosing for persistent asthma should not use
additional salmeterol doses for this indication and use alternative therapy (e.g., albuterol) prior to
exercise.
­

For long-term asthma control, should be used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.
Should not be used to relieve symptoms of acute asthma. It is long acting and has its
onset of action in 10 to 20 min with a peak effect at 3 hr. May be used at QHS (1
inhalation of the dry powder inhaler [DPI]) for nocturnal symptoms. Salmeterol is a chronic
medication and is not used in similar fashion to short-acting β agonists (e.g., albuterol).
Patients already receiving salmeterol every 12 hr should not use additional doses for
prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm; consider alternative therapy. Asthma
exacerbations or hospitalizations were reported to be lower when this medication was used
with an inhaled corticosteroid.
WARNING: Long-acting β-2-agonists as monotherapy increase the risks of asthma-related
death and asthma-related hospitalizations. Monotherapy without concomitant use of an inhaled
corticosteroid is contraindicated in asthma. Use salmeterol only as additional therapy for patients
not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low- to medium-dose
inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly requires initiation of treatment with two
maintenance therapies. Contraindicated in milk allergies; contains milk proteins.
Should not be used in conjunction with an inhaled, long-acting β-2 agonist and is not a substitute
for inhaled or systemic corticosteroid. Use with strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole,
HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, and telithromycin) is not
recommended due to risk for cardiovascular adverse events (e.g., QTc prolongation, tachycardia).
Salmeterol is a CYP450 3A4 substrate.
Proper patient education is essential. Use with caution in hepatic impairment. Side effects are
similar to those of albuterol. Hypertension and arrhythmias have been reported. See Chapter 24 for
recommendations for asthma controller therapy.

Drug is contraindicated in combination (or within 14 days of discontinuing use) with a
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (e.g., linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) or
pimozide (increases adverse/toxic effects of pimozide). Use with caution in patients with
abnormal bleeding, syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion, and
hepatic or renal impairment. Adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, tremor, and
increased sweating. Hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus, rhabdomyolysis, trismus, and
platelet dysfunction have been reported. A positive correlation with length of QTc interval
and serum sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline levels has been reported.
Monitor for clinical worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/behavior following the initiation of
therapy or after dose changes. Use during the late third trimester of pregnancy may increase risk
for withdrawal symptoms and persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.
Use with drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin) may increase risk for
GI bleeds. Use with warfarin may increase PT. Inhibits the CYP 450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme.
Serotonin syndrome may occur when taken with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g.,
amitriptyline, amphetamines, buspirone, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, sympathomimetics).
Sertraline is a substrate for CYP 450 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Poor metabolizers of CYP 450
2C19 should initiate therapy at 50% of the recommended dosage and titrate to desired effect or
consider using an alternative medication not predominantly metabolized by this enzyme. Ultrarapid
2C19 metabolizers should initiate therapy at the recommended starting dose and titrate to the
recommended maintenance dosage or consider using a drug not predominantly metabolized by
this enzyme.
Do not abruptly discontinue use; gradually taper dose (4–6 wk has been recommended) to reduce risk
for withdrawal symptoms.
Mix oral concentrate solution with 4 oz of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade, or orange
juice. After mixing, a slight haze may appear; this is normal. This dosage form should be used
cautiously in patients with latex allergy because the dropper contains dry natural rubber.

Pulmonary hypertension:
Neonate (limited data from case reports and small clinical trials):
PO: Several dosages have been reported and have ranged from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg/dose
Q 6–12 hr PO. A single dose of ∼0.3 mg/kg PO has been used in select patients to facilitate
weaning from inhaled nitric oxide.
IV (case report from 4 neonates >34 wk gestation and <72 hr old): Start with 0.4 mg/kg/dose
IV over 3 hr followed by a continuous infusion of 1.6 mg/kg/24 hr (0.067 mg/kg/hr) for up to
7 days.

SILDENAFIL continued

Contraindicated with concurrent use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) and other nitric oxide
donors; potentiates hypotensive effects. Use with caution in sepsis (high levels of cGMP
may potentiate hypotension), hypotension, sickle cell anemia (use not established) and
with concurrent CYP 450 3A4 inhibiting medications (see discussion that follows) and
anti-hypertensive medications. Hepatic insufficiency or severe renal impairment
(glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <30 mL/min) significantly reduces sildenafil clearance.
Findings from the dose-ranging study in 1- to 17-yr-olds with pulmonary arterial hypertension found
an association of increased mortality risk with long-term use (>2 yr). Headache, pyrexia, upper
respiratory tract infections (URTIs), vomiting, and diarrhea were the most frequently reported side
effect in this study. Optimal dosing based on age and body weight still needs to be determined.
Hazard ratios for mortality were 3.95 (95% CI: 1.46–10.65) for high versus low doses and 1.92
(95% CI: 0.65–5.65) for medium versus low doses in follow-up study for those receiving therapy for
≥3 yr. A subsequent extension open-label study on the same population for an additional 16 weeks
reported a greater hazard ratio for mortality with high- versus low-dose therapy (P = 0.007).
In adults, a transient impairment of color discrimination may occur; this effect could increase risk
of severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates. Common side effects reported in adults have
included flushing, rash, diarrhea, indigestion, headache, abnormal vision, and nasal congestion.
Hearing loss has been reported.
Sildenafil is substrate for CYP 450 3A4 (major) and 2C8/9 (minor). Azole antifungals, cimetidine,
ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine,
verapamil, and grapefruit juice may increase the effects/toxicity of sildenafil. Bosentin, efavirenz,
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort, and high-fat meals may
decrease sildenafil effects.

Increased susceptibility to infection and development of lymphoma may result from
immunosuppression. Fatal bronchial anastomotic dehiscence has been reported in lung
transplantation. Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis have been
reported in liver transplantation when used with tacrolimus. Patients with the greatest
amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein
excretion increased the most after conversion. Increase risk of BK virus associated
nephropathies have been reported. The following adverse effects have been reported when
converting from a calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen to maintenance sirolimus:
Stable liver transplant: increased mortality
Kidney transplant: pneumonia, proteinuria, acute rejection, graft loss and death.
Monitor whole-blood trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state); especially with pediatric
patients; hepatic impairment; concurrent use of CYP 450 3A4 and/or P-gp inducers and inhibitors;
and/or if cyclosporine dosage is markedly changed or discontinued. Steady-state is generally
achieved after 5 to 7 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on specific treatment protocol and assay methodology (HPLC vs immunoassay vs LC/MS/MS). Younger children
may exhibit faster sirolimus clearance compared with adolescents.
Sirolimus is a substrate for CYP 450 3A4 and P-gp. Cyclosporine, diltiazem, protease inhibitors,
erythromycin, grapefruit juice and other inhibitors of CYP 3A4 may increase the toxicity of sirolimus. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John’s wort may decrease the effects of
sirolimus. Strong inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals and clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g.,
rifamycins) are not recommended.
Hypertension, peripheral edema, increase serum creatinine, dyspnea, epistaxis, headache, anemia,
thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and arthralgia may occur. Progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), diabetes mellitus, posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome, ovarian cysts and menstrual disorders have been reported. Urinary tract infections have
been reported in pediatric renal transplant patients with high immunologic risk.
Two milligrams of the oral solution have been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to the 2-mg
tablets. However, it is not known whether they are still therapeutically equivalent at higher
doses. Reduce maintenance dosage by one-third in the presence of hepatic function impairment.
Administer doses consistently with or without food. When administered with cyclosporine, give
dose 4 hr after cyclosporine. Do not crush or split tablets. Measure the oral liquid dosage form
with an amber oral syringe and dilute in a cup with 60 mL of water or orange juice only. Take dose
immediately after mixing, add/mix additional 120 mL diluent into the cup, and drink immediately
after mixing.

Ahmad Abusadeh

Adult (see remarks):
Patients at low/moderate immunologic risk:
In combination with cyclosporine (adjust dose to achieve desired trough blood levels):
<40 kg: 3 mg/m2/dose PO given once immediately after transplantation followed by
1 mg/m2/dose PO once on the next day
≥40 kg: 6 mg PO once immediately after transplantation, followed by 2 mg PO once on the next day
Patients at high immunologic risk:
In combination with cyclosporine (withdrawal of cyclosporine is not recommended): 15 mg PO
once immediately after transplantation, followed by 5 mg PO once on the next day. Adjust dose to
achieve desired trough blood levels.

Injection: 100 mg sodium phenylacetate and 100 mg sodium benzoate per 1 mL (50 mL)

Indicated for hyperammonemia due to enzyme deficiencies of the urea cycle (e.g., carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase [CPS] and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency). Use with caution
in renal and hepatic impairment. Significant amounts of sodium may be administered with
prolonged durations of therapy. Ammonia clearance is most efficient with hemodialysis.
Side effects include hypotension, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, injection site reaction, nausea/vomiting,
altered mental status, fever, metabolic acidosis, cerebral edema, seizures, anemia, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation. CNS side effects are more frequent with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC)
and CPS. Blood and lymphatic system disorders and hypotension are common in patients 30 days old or
younger, whereas nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common in patients more than 30 days old.
Although no formal drug interaction studies have been completed, penicillin antibiotics and probenecid
may increase serum concentrations of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate by competing for
renal tubular secretion. Use of valproic acid or corticosteroids may increase plasma ammonia levels.

Contraindicated in Addison disease, hyperkalemia, use with eplerenone, or severe renal
failure (see Chapter 31). Use with caution in dehydration, hyponatremia, and renal or
hepatic dysfunction. Precipitation of impaired neurologic function, worsening hepatic
encephalopathy, and coma may occur with hepatic disease with cirrhosis and ascites. May
cause hyperkalemia (especially with severe heart failure), GI distress, rash, lethargy,
dizziness, and gynecomastia. May potentiate ganglionic blocking agents and other
antihypertensives. Monitor potassium levels and be aware of other K+ sources, K+-sparing
diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] (all of which can increase
K+).
Do not use with other medications known to cause hyperkalemia (e.g., ACEIs, angiotensin II antagonists, aldosterone blockers, and other potassium-sparing diuretics). Hyperkalemic metabolic
acidosis has been reported with concurrent cholestyramine use. May cause false elevation in serum
digoxin levels measured by radioimmunoassay.

SUCCINYLCHOLINE continued

Contraindicated after the acute phase of an injury following major burns, multiple trauma,
extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury because severe
hyperkalemia and subsequent cardiac arrest may occur. Individuals carrying the RYR1 or
CACNA1S gene have an increased risk for developing malignant hyperthermia with
succinylcholine or halogenated volatile anesthetics; use in these individuals is
contraindicated. Succinylcholine should be avoided in patients who are susceptible to
malignant hyperthermia.
Pretreatment with atropine is recommended to reduce incidence of bradycardia. For rapid sequence
intubation, see Chapter 1.
Cardiac arrest has been reported in children and adolescents primarily with skeletal muscle myopathies
(e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Identify developmental delays suggestive of a myopathy prior to
use. Predose creatine kinase may be useful for identifying patients at risk. Monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for peaked T waves may be useful in detecting early signs of this adverse effect.
May cause malignant hyperthermia (use dantrolene to treat), bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmia,
and hyperkalemia. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been reported; use caution if previous
anaphylactic reaction to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Use with caution in patients
with severe burns, paraplegia, or crush injuries and in patients with preexisting hyperkalemia.
Beware of prolonged depression in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, pseudocholinesterase
deficiency, hypothermia and those receiving aminoglycosides, phenothiazines, quinidine, β blockers, amphotericin B, cyclophosphamide, diuretics, lithium, acetylcholine, and anticholinesterases.
Diazepam may decrease neuromuscular blocking effects. Prior use of succinylcholine may enhance
the neuromuscular blocking effect of vecuronium and its duration of action.
Duration of action 4–6 min IV, 10–30 min IM. Must be prepared to intubate within 1 min.

Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin that binds to rocuronium and vecuronium for
reduced neuromuscular blockade.
Use is not recommended for GFR <30 mL/min or on dialysis. Use with caution in hepatic
impairment, especially in the presence of coagulopathy or severe edema.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and headache. Serious effects include bradycardia,
prolonged QTc interval, hypersensitivity reactions/anaphylaxis, increase creatine kinase, and
bronchospasms. Sugammadex may increase the effects/toxicity of anticoagulants, and decrease
the effects of hormonal contraceptives. Fusidic acid and toremifene may decrease sugammadex
activity.
Limited data in children (especially <2 yr) and dosing in a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group,
dose-finding study in 63 children (28 days to 17 yr of age) and 28 adult surgical patients.
Doses were well tolerated across all ages with dose-response relationship for those 2 yr of age

endotracheal tube with two attendants (one to instill drug and another to monitor and position
patient). Each dose is divided into two aliquots of 1.5-mL/kg each; administer 1.5 mL/kg in each
of two different positions (infant positioned with either the right or left side dependent). Drug is
administered while ventilation is continued over 20 to 30 breaths for each aliquot, with small bursts
timed only during the inspiratory cycles. A pause followed by evaluation of respiratory status and
repositioning should separate the two aliquots. The drug has also been administered by divided dose
into four equal aliquots and administered with repositioning in the prone, supine, right, and left
lateral positions.

Common adverse effects include cyanosis, airway obstruction, bradycardia, reflux of
surfactant into the endotracheal (ET) tube, requirement for manual ventilation, and
reintubation. Monitor O2 saturation and lung compliance after each dose such that oxygen
therapy and ventilator pressure are adjusted as necessary.
All doses administered intratracheally via a 5-french feeding catheter. If suspension settles during
storage, gently swirl the contents; do not shake. Drug is stored in the refrigerator, protected from
light, and does not need to be warmed before administration. Unopened vials that have been
warmed to room temperature (once only) may be refrigerated within 24 hr and stored for future use.
For rescue therapy, repeat doses may be administered as early as 6 hr after the previous dose for a
total of up to four doses if the infant is still intubated and requires at least 30% inspired oxygen to
maintain a PaO2 ≥80 torr.

Tacrolimus is a substrate of the CYP 450 3A4 drug metabolizing enzyme and Pgp transporter. A 1.5–
2-fold higher initial standard dose up to a max. dose of 0.3 mg/kg/24 hr has been recommended
for intermediate or extensive metabolizers for CYP 450 3A5. Calcium channel blockers, imidazole
antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clotrimazole, posaconazole), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin), cisapride, cimetidine, cyclosporine, danazol,
herbal products containing schisandra sphenanthera extracts, methylprednisolone, grapefruit
juice, seville oranges, and severe diarrhea can increase tacrolimus serum levels. In contrast,
carbamazepine, caspofungin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, and sirolimus may
decrease levels. Use with sirolimus may increase risk for hepatic artery thrombosis. Avoid use of
live attenuated vaccines. Use with other CYP 450 3A inhibitors and substrates has the potential to
prolong the cardiac QT interval. Reduce dose in renal or hepatic insufficiency.
Monitor trough levels (just prior to a dose at steady state). Steady state is generally achieved after
2–5 days of continuous dosing. Interpretation will vary based on treatment protocol and assay
methodology (whole blood ELISA vs. MEIA vs. HPLC). Whole blood trough concentrations of 5–20
ng/mL have been recommended in liver transplantation at 1–12 mo. Trough levels of 7–20 ng/
mL (whole blood) for the first 3 mo and 5–15 ng/mL after 3 mo have been recommended in renal
transplantation. African Americans may need to be titrated to higher dosages.
Tacrolimus therapy generally should be initiated 6 hr or more after transplantation. PO is the
preferred route of administration and all PO dosage forms should be administered on an empty
stomach (1 hr before and 2 hr after meals).
Astagraf XL (extended release capsule): Safety and efficacy has been established for de novo and
stable (receiving immediate-release dosage form) pediatric kidney transplant patients. A mg per
mg conversion from immediate release dosage form to Astagraf XL has been recommended.
Envarsus XR (extended release tablet): Currently labeled for use in adult kidney transplant patients
(de novo and stable on immediate-release tacrolimus). When converting to Envarsus XR from
immediate-release dosage form, initiate at 80% of the established immediate-release dosage
form.
All extended-release formulations are NOT interchangeable. IV infusions should be administered at
concentrations between 0.004 and 0.02 mg/mL diluted with NS or D5W.
TOPICAL USE: Not recommended for use in patients with skin conditions with a skin barrier defect
with the potential for systemic absorption. Do not use in children <2 yr, immunocompromised
patients, or with occlusive dressings (promotes systemic absorption). Approved as a second-line
therapy for short-term and intermittent treatment of atopic dermatitis for patients who fail to
respond, or do not tolerate, other approved therapies. Long-term safety is unknown. Skin burn sensation, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reaction, skin erythema, headache, and skin infection
are the most common side effects. Application site edema has been reported. Although the risk is
uncertain, the FDA has issued an alert about the potential cancer risk with the use of this product.

thrombotic microangiopathy, and liver failure (some fatal) have been reported. Monitor
AST/ALT at baseline and repeat with CBC if therapy is >6 wk. Signs and symptoms of liver
disease may include persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal
pain, or jaundice. Discontinue use immediately if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver
injury develops.
Use with caution in renal impairment as terbinafine’s clearance has been shown to decrease by
∼50% in adults with CrCl ≤50 mL/min. Terbinafine inhibits CYP 450 2D6, thus increasing the
effects/toxicity of 2D6 substrates such as amphetamines, risperidone, and fluoxetine.

gastroesophageal reflux, nervousness, tachycardia, seizures, and arrhythmias.
Serum levels should be monitored. Therapeutic levels: bronchospasm: 10–20 mg/L; apnea: 7–13
mg/L. Half-life is age-dependent: 30 hr (newborns); 6.9 hr (infants); 3.4 hr (children); 8.1 hr
(adults). See Aminophylline for guidelines for serum level determinations. Liver impairment,
cardiac failure, and sustained high fever may increase theophylline levels. Theophylline is a
substrate for CYP 450 1A2. Levels are increased with allopurinol, alcohol, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine,
clarithromycin, disulfiram, erythromycin, estrogen, isoniazid, propranolol, thiabendazole, and
verapamil. Levels are decreased with carbamazepine, isoproterenol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and
rifampin. May cause increased skeletal muscle activity, agitation, and hyperactivity when used
with doxapram, and increase quinine levels/toxicity.
Use ideal body weight in obese patients when calculating dosage because of poor distribution into
body fat. Risk factors for increased clearance include: smoking, cystic fibrosis, hyperthyroidism,
and high-protein diet. Factors for decreased clearance include CHF, correction of hyperthyroidism,
fever, viral illness, sepsis, and high carbohydrate diet.

Indicated for schizophrenia unresponsive to standard therapy. Contraindicated in severe CNS
depression, brain damage, narrow-angle glaucoma, blood dyscrasias, and severe liver or
cardiovascular disease. DO NOT co-administer with drugs which may inhibit the CYP 450 2D6
isoenzymes (e.g., SSRIs such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine; and beta-blockers such
as propranolol and pindolol); drugs which may widen the QTc interval (e.g., disopyramide,
procainamide, quinidine); and in patients with known reduced activity of CYP 450 2D6.
May cause drowsiness, extrapyramidal reactions, autonomic symptoms, ECG changes (QTc
prolongation in a dose-dependent manner), arrhythmias, paradoxical reactions, and endocrine
disturbances. Long-term use may cause tardive dyskinesia. Pigmentary retinopathy may occur with
higher doses; a periodic eye exam is recommended. More autonomic symptoms and less extrapyramidal effects than chlorpromazine. Concurrent use with epinephrine can cause hypotension.
Increased cardiac arrhythmias may occur with tricyclic antidepressants.
In an overdose situation, monitor ECG and avoid drugs that can widen QTc interval.

Use with caution in hepatic insufficiency (may need to reduce dose and/or increase dosing
interval). Most common side effects include dizziness, somnolence, depression, confusion,
and asthenia. Nervousness, tremor, nausea, abdominal pain, confusion, and difficulty in
concentrating may also occur. Cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting in
nonconvulsive status epilepticus requiring subsequent dose reduction or drug
discontinuation have been reported. Suicidal behavior or ideation, bullous dermatitis, and
blurred vision have been reported. Off-label use in patients WITHOUT epilepsy is
discouraged due to reports of seizures in these patients.
Tiagabine’s clearance is increased by concurrent hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g.,
phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates), and St. John’s Wort. Lower doses or a slower titration
for clinical response may be necessary for patients receiving non-enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g.,
valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine). Avoid abrupt discontinuation of drug.
TID dosing schedule may be preferred since BID schedule may not be well tolerated. Doses should be
administered with food.

Use with caution in combination with neurotoxic, ototoxic, or nephrotoxic drugs; anesthetics
or neuromuscular blocking agents; pre-existing renal, vestibular, or auditory impairment;
and in patients with neuromuscular disorders. May cause ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and
neuromuscular blockade. Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and
dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis,
erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported rarely. Ototoxic
effects synergistic with furosemide.
Higher doses are recommended in patients with cystic fibrosis, neutropenia, or burns. Adjust dose in
renal failure (see Chapter 31). Monitor peak and trough levels.
Therapeutic peak levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing:
6–10 mg/L in general
8–10 mg/L in pulmonary infections, neutropenia, osteomyelitis, and severe sepsis
Therapeutic trough levels with conventional Q8 hr dosing: <2 mg/L. Recommended serum sampling
time at steady state: trough within 30 min prior to the third consecutive dose and peak 30–60 min
after the administration of the third consecutive dose.
Therapeutic peak and trough goals for high-dose extended-interval dosing for cystic fibrosis:
Peak: 20–40 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time at 30–60 min after the administration of
the first dose.
Trough: <1 mg/L; recommended serum sampling time within 30 min before the second dose.
Serum levels should be rechecked with changing renal function, poor clinical response, and at a
minimum of once weekly for prolonged therapies.
To maximize bactericidal effects, an individualized peak concentration to target a peak/MIC ratio of
8–10:1 may be applied.
For initial dosing in obese patients, use an adjusted body weight (ABW). ABW = Ideal Body Weight +
0.4 (Total Body Weight – Ideal Body Weight).

Drug is metabolized by and inhibits the CYP 450 2C19 isoenzyme. Phenytoin, valproic acid, and
carbamazepine may decrease topiramate levels. Topiramate may decrease valproic acid, digoxin,
warfarin, and ethinyl estradiol (to decrease oral contraceptive efficacy) but may increase phenytoin
levels/effects. Alcohol and CNS depressants may increase CNS side effects. Carbonic anhydrase

liver via CYP 450 2C8 and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the urinary route.
Inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) may increase and decrease
treprostinil effects, respectfully.
Flushing, muscle pain (especially with SC route), headaches, and diarrhea are common side effects with
injectable routes. Central line gram-negative catheter infections have been reported with the IV route.
Recommendations for reducing this risk include using watertight seals in the drug delivery system and
closed-hub systems, replacing the diluent with the diluent used for epoprostenol, and using the SC route.
Thrombocytopenia has been reported with SC administration. Worsening of reactive airway symptoms,
cough, dizziness, bone pain, headache, syncope, and flushing may occur with the inhaled route. Headache,
diarrhea, nausea, and flushing are common side effects with the oral dosage form in clinical trials.
Treprostinil has a longer T1/2 than epoprostenol with better room temperature stability (depending on
specific diluent used).
Do not abruptly withdrawal therapy and have a backup plan for interruptions with IV/SC continuous
therapies (e.g., backup pumps and medications).

31). Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) has been
reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and in bone marrow and renal transplant
recipients. Probenecid or cimetidine can reduce the rate of conversion to acyclovir.
Headache, nausea, and abdominal pain are common adverse events in adults. Headache
is common in children. See Acyclovir for additional drug interactions and adverse effects.
For initial episodes of genital herpes, therapy is most effective when initiated within 48 hr of
symptom onset. Therapy should be initiated immediately after the onset of symptoms in recurrent

Contraindicated in hepatic disease, pregnancy (for migraine indication), urea cycle disorders (e.g.,
OTC deficiency), mitochondrial disorders with mutations in DNA polymerase γ (e.g., AlpersHuttenlocher syndrome), and children <2 yr suspected of the aforementioned mitochondrial
disorder. May cause GI, liver, blood, and CNS toxicity; weight gain; transient alopecia;
pancreatitis (potentially life-threatening); nausea; sedation; vomiting; headache;
thrombocytopenia (dose-related); platelet dysfunction; rash (especially with lamotrigine); and
hyperammonemia. Hepatic failure has occurred especially in children <2 yr (especially those
receiving multiple anticonvulsants, with congenital metabolic disorders, with severe seizure
disorders with mental retardation, and with organic brain disease). Idiosyncratic life-threatening
pancreatitis has been reported in children and adults. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has
been reported in patients with urea cycle disorders. Suicidal behavior or ideation, male infertility,
elevated testosterone, decreased bone mineral density, DRESS, encephalopathy without elevated
ammonia levels, hair texture/color changes, and nail/nail bed disorders have been reported.
Valproic acid is a substrate for CYP 450 2C19 isoenzyme and an inhibitor of CYP 450 2C9, 2D6 and
3A3/4 (weak). It increases amitriptyline/nortriptyline, rufinamide, phenytoin, propofol, diazepam,
and phenobarbital levels. Concomitant estrogen-containing contraceptives, phenytoin, phenobarbital, topiramate, meropenem, cholestyramine, and carbamazepine may decrease valproic acid
levels. Amitriptyline or nortriptyline may increase valproic acid levels. May interfere with urine
ketone and thyroid tests.
Do not give syrup with carbonated beverages. Use of IV route has not been evaluated for >14 days of
continuous use. Infuse IV over 1 hr up to a max. rate of 20 mg/min. Depakote and Depakote ER are
NOT bioequivalent; see package insert for dose conversion.

Contraindicated with aliskiren use in diabetic patients. Discontinue use immediately after
when pregnancy is detected. Use with caution in renal (CrCl <30 mL/min) and liver
insufficiency, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, renal artery stenosis, renal function
changes, and volume depletion.
Hypotension, dizziness, headache, cough, and increases in BUN and sCr are common side effects.
Hyperkalemia (most commonly reported in children <6 yr with underlying renal disease in clinical trials;
also consider salt substitutes, foods, and medications which may increase potassium levels), bullous
dermatitis, angioedema, acute renal failure, and dysgeusia have been reported. May increase lithium
levels resulting in toxicity for those receiving concurrent lithium therapy; monitor lithium levels closely.
Onset of initial antihypertensive effects is 2 hr with maximum effects after 2–4 wk of chronic use.
Patients may require higher doses of oral tablet dosage form than with the oral suspension due to
increased bioavailability with the oral suspension.

Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur and may be exacerbated with concurrent
aminoglycoside use. Greater nephrotoxicity risk has been associated with higher
therapeutic serum trough concentrations (≥15 mg/mL), concurrent piperacillin/tazobactam
therapy, and receiving furosemide in the intensive care unit. Adjust dose in renal failure
(see Chapter 31). Use total body weight for obese patients when calculating dosages. Low
concentrations of the drug may appear in CSF with inflamed meninges. Nausea, vomiting,
and drug-induced erythroderma are common with IV use. “Red man syndrome” associated
with rapid IV infusion may occur. Infuse over 60 min (may infuse over 120 min if 60-min
infusion is not tolerated). NOTE: Diphenhydramine is used to reverse red man syndrome.
Allergic reactions (including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]),
neutropenia, and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Although current extrapolated adult guidelines suggest measuring only trough levels, an additional
post-distributional level may be useful in characterizing enhanced/altered drug clearance for
quicker dosage modification to attain target levels; this may be useful for infants with known
faster clearance and patients in renal compromise. Consult a pharmacist.
The following therapeutic trough level recommendations are based on the assumption that the
pathogen’s Vancomycin MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L.

Peak level measurement (20–50 mg/L) has also been recommended for patients with burns, clinically

Recommended serum sampling time at steady state: Trough within 30 min prior to the
fourth consecutive dose and peak 60 min after the administration of the fourth consecutive
dose. Infants with faster elimination (shorter T1/2) may be sampled around the third consecutive
dose.
Recent evidence strongly suggests moving away from serum trough vancomycin monitoring to
a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) target of area under the curve (AUC) to MIC
ratio. An AUC{24} of 400–600 mg*h/L is associated with clinical efficacy and reduced risk
for AKI. Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring guidelines are currently being revised by the
IDSA in collaboration with PIDS, SIDP, and ASHP and are forthcoming. Consult with an ID
specialist and pharmacist to see how best this monitoring method is operationalized at your
institution.
ORAL USE for C. difficile: Vancomycin (PO) or metronidazole (PO) are currently the recommended
first-line therapy for children, whereas vancomycin (PO) or fidaxomicin is recommended for adults.
See Clinical Infectious Diseases 66(7):e1–e48 for the 2017 IDSA/SHEA Clinical Practice Guidelines.
Common adverse effects with oral vancomycin capsules in adults include nausea, abdominal pain,
and hypokalemia.

A-deficiency (anaphylactic reactions may occur), and known immunity to varicella zoster
virus. See Chapter 16 for indications. Local discomfort, redness, and swelling at the
injection site, and headache may occur.
Hyperviscosity of the blood may increase risk for thrombotic events. Interferes with immune response
to live virus vaccines such as measles, mumps and rubella; defer administration of live vaccines 6
mo or longer after VZIG dose. See latest AAP Red Book for additional information.
Avoid IM injection into the gluteal region due to risk for sciatic nerve damage and do not exceed

Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and neuromuscular disease.
Dose reduction may be necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Infants (7 wk to 1 yr) are more
sensitive to the drug and may have a longer recovery time. Children (1–10 yr) may require
higher doses and more frequent supplementation than adults. Enflurane, isoflurane,
aminoglycosides, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, clindamycin, furosemide,
magnesium salts, quinidine, procainamide, and cyclosporine may increase the potency and
duration of neuromuscular blockade. Calcium, caffeine, carbamazepine, phenytoin,
steroids (chronic use), acetylcholinesterases, and azathioprine may decrease effects. May
cause arrhythmias, rash, and bronchospasm. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been

recommended dose: 1500 mg BID; max. dose: 6000 mg/24 hr. Doses >3 g/24 hr has not shown to
provide additional benefit and is associated with more side effects.
Use with caution in renal impairment (reduce dose; see Chapter 31) and other CNS
depressants (enhanced effects). Can cause progressive and permanent vision loss (risk
increases with dose and duration); periodic vision testing is required. Common side effects
in children and adults include rash, weight gain, GI disturbances, arthralgia, visual
disturbances, vertigo, sedation, headache, confusion, and URIs. Liver failure, anemia,
psychotic disorder, angioedema, Stevens Johnson syndrome, TEN, alopecia, and suicidal
ideation have been reported. Dose-dependent abnormal MRIs and intramyelinic edema (in
postmortem exams) have been reported in infants treated for infantile spasms.
Ketorolac, naproxen, and mefloquine may decrease the effect of vigabatrin. Vigabatrin may decrease
the effects/levels of phenytoin but increase the levels/toxicity of carbamazepine.
Use in adjunctive therapy for refractory complex partial seizure has labeled indication for ≥10-yr-old

High doses above the U.S. RDA are teratogenic (category X). The use of vitamin A in
measles is recommended in children 6 mo–2 yr of age who are either hospitalized or who
have any of the following risk factors: immunodeficiency, ophthalmologic evidence of
vitamin A deficiency, impaired GI absorption, moderate to severe malnutrition, and recent
immigration from areas with high measles mortality. May cause GI disturbance, rash,
headache, increased ICP (pseudotumor cerebri), papilledema, and irritability. Large doses
may increase the effects of warfarin. Mineral oil, cholestyramine and neomycin will reduce
vitamin A absorption. Do not access vitamin A levels during an acute inflammatory

Contraindicated with concomitant administration with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting
barbiturates, ritonavir, efavirenz, rifabutin, ergot alkaloids, or St. John’s Wort (decreases
voriconazole levels); and with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, or sirolimus
(voriconazole increases levels of these drugs to increase side effects). Use with caution in
proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., congenital/acquired QTc prolongation, cardiomyopathy, and sinus
bradycardia), severe hepatic disease, galactose intolerance, and concurrent use with CYP 450
3A4 substrates that can lead to prolonged QTc interval (e.g., cisapride, pimozide, and quinidine).
Drug is a substrate and inhibitor for CYP 450 2C9, 2C19 (major substrate), and 3A4 isoenzymes.
Specific CYP 2C19 phenotype and use recommendation for children and adults are as follows:

VORICONAZOLE continued
Currently approved for use in invasive aspergillosis; candidemia and disseminated candidiasis in
skin, abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds; candidal esophagitis; and serious infections
caused by Fusarium species and Scedosporium apiospermum in children ≥2 yr of age.
Common side effects include GI disturbances, fever, headache, hepatic abnormalities, photosensitivity (higher incidence in children; avoid direct sunlight and use protective measures), rash (6%),
and visual disturbances (30%). Serious but rare side effects include anaphylaxis, liver or renal
failure, and Stevens-Johnsons syndrome. Pancreatitis has been reported in children. Monitor
serum transaminase and bilirubin levels weekly for the first month of therapy followed by reduced
frequency has been recommended. Higher frequency of LFT elevations has reported with children.
Dermatological follow up is recommended for those who develop photosensitivity reactions as
squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in those who experience this adverse reaction.
Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels before and during voriconazole therapy. Adjust
dose in hepatic impairment by decreasing only the maintenance dose by 50% for patients with
a Child-Pugh Class A or B. Do not use IV dosage form for patients with GFR <50 mL/min because
of accumulation of the cyclodextrin excipient; switch to oral therapy if possible. Patients receiving
concurrent phenytoin should increase their voriconazole maintenance doses (IV: 5 mg/kg/dose Q 12
hr; PO: double the usual dose).
Inter-occasion pharmacokinetic variability is high, thus requiring serum level monitoring. Therapeutic
levels: trough: 1–5.5 mg/L. Levels <1 mg/L have resulted in treatment failures and levels >5.5
mg/L have resulted in neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy. Recommended serum sampling time:
obtain trough within 30 min prior to a dose. Steady state is typically achieved after 5–7 days of
initiating therapy.
Oral bioequivalence of the oral suspension and tablet has not been evaluated in children. Administer
IV over 1–2 hr with a max. rate of 3 mg/kg/hr at a concentration ≤ 5 mg/mL. Administer oral doses

Side effects include fever, skin lesions, skin necrosis (especially in protein C deficiency),
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and hemoptysis.
Warfarin is a substrate for CYP 450 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, and 3A3/4. Amiodarone, azole antifungals (e.g., fluconazole, voriconazole), broad spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefepime, meropenem,
piperacillin/tazobactam), chloramphenicol, chloral hydrate, cimetidine, corticosteroids, delavirdine,
fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), fluoxetine, metronidazole, indomethacin, large
doses of vitamins A or E, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, omeprazole, oxandrolone, quinidine, salicylates, SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline), sulfonamides, and zafirlukast may
increase warfarin’s effect. Ascorbic acid, barbiturates, carbamazepine, cholestyramine, dicloxacillin, griseofulvin, oral contraceptives, nafcillin, ribavirin, rifampin, spironolactone, sucralfate, and
vitamin K (including foods with high content) may decrease warfarin’s effect.

Use with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Dosage reduction is
recommended in severe renal impairment and may be necessary in hepatic dysfunction. Drug
penetrates well into the CNS. Most common side effects include: anemia, granulocytopenia, nausea,
and headache (dosage reduction, erythropoietin, filgrastim/GCSF, or discontinuance may be required
depending on event). Seizures, confusion, rash, myositis, myopathy (use > 1 yr), hepatitis, and
elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Macrocytosis is noted after 4 wk of therapy and can be
used as an indicator of compliance. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including
fatal cases, have been reported. Neutropenia and severe anemia have been reported in advanced HIV
disease. Use of injectable dosage form may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals.
Do not use in combination with stavudine because of poor antiretroviral effect. Effects of interacting
drugs include: increased toxicity (acyclovir, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); increased hematological
toxicity (ganciclovir, interferon-alpha, marrow suppressive drugs); and granulocytopenia (drugs which
affect glucuronidation). Methadone, atovaquone, cimetidine, valproic acid, probenecid, and fluconazole
may increase levels of zidovudine, whereas rifampin, rifabutin, and clarithromycin may decrease levels.

Because zonisamide is a sulfonamide, it is contraindicated in patients allergic to
sulfonamides (may result in Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN). Common side effects of
drowsiness, ataxia, anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, rash, and pruritis
usually occur early in therapy and can be minimized with slow dose titration. Children are
at increased risk for hyperthermia and oligohydrosis, especially in warm or hot weather.
Suicidal behavior or ideation, acute pancreatitis, urolithiasis, metabolic acidosis (more
frequent and severe in younger patients), DRESS/multi-organ hypersensitivity,
rhabdomyolysis, and elevated creatinine phosphokinase have been reported.
Although not fully delineated, therapeutic serum levels of 20–30 mg/L have been suggested as
higher rates of adverse reactions have been seen at levels > 30 mg/L.
Zonisamide is a CYP 450 3A4 substrate. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital can decrease
levels of zonisamide.
Use with caution in renal or hepatic impairment; slower dose titration and more frequent monitoring
is recommended. Do not use if GFR is <50 mL/min. Avoid abrupt discontinuation or radical dose
reductions. Swallow capsules whole and do not crush or chew.

I. DOSE ADJUSTMENT METHODS
A. Maintenance Dose
In patients with renal insufficiency, the dose may be adjusted using the
following methods:
1.	Interval extension (I): Lengthen intervals between individual doses,
keeping dose size normal. For this method, a suggested interval is
shown.
2.	Dose reduction (D): Reduce number of individual doses, keeping interval
between doses normal; recommended when relatively constant blood
level of drug is desired. For this method, percentage of usual dose
is shown. For some medications and indications, specific dosing is
provided.
3.	Interval extension and dose reduction (DI): Both lengthen interval and
reduce dose.
4.	Interval extension or dose reduction (D, I): In some instances, either
dose or interval can be changed.
NOTE: These dose adjustment methods do not apply to patients in the neonatal period. For neonatal renal dosing, please consult a neonatal dosage
reference (see Chapter 18). Dose modifications given are only approximations and may not be appropriate for all patients or indications. Each patient
must be monitored closely for signs of drug toxicity, and serum levels must
be measured when available; drug doses and intervals should be adjusted
accordingly. When in doubt, always consult a nephrologist or pharmacist
who has expertise in renal dosing.
B. Dialysis
General recommendations are provided when available. However, factors
such as patient age, indication for use, residual native kidney function,
specific peritoneal dialysis (PD) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) settings,
etc., will affect the medication dosing needs of each individual patient.
Consult with a nephrologist or pharmacist who is familiar with medication
dosing in dialysis prior to prescribing medications for a dialysis patient.

maximum eGFR value of 150
mL/min/1.73 m2 should be
used to calculate the dose.
Calculate eGFR using modified
Schwartz formula where k

year, with low birth weight for
gestational age, 0.45 in infants
aged <1 year, with birth weight
appropriate for gestational
age, 0.45 in children aged 1 to

3A

No Pulse

• Give 1 breath
every 3-5 seconds
• Add compressions
if pulse remains
<60/min with
poor perfusion
despite adequate
oxygenation
and ventilation
• Recheck pulse
every 2 minutes

One Rescuer: Begin cycles of
30 COMPRESSIONS and 2 BREATHS

High-Quality CPR
• Rate at least
100-120/min
• Compression
depth to at least
¹⁄³ anteriorposterior
diameter of
chest, about 1½
inches (4 cm) in
infants and 2
inches (5 cm)
in children
• Allow complete
chest recoil
after each
compression
• Minimize
interruptions
in chest
compressions
• Avoid excessive
ventilation

Two Rescuers: Begin cycles of
15 COMPRESSIONS and 2 BREATHS

Shockable

Check rhythm
Shockable rhythm?

Give 1 shock
Resume CPR immediately
for 2 minutes
Continue until ALS
providers take over or
victim starts to move

8

Not Shockable

Resume CPR immediately
for 2 minutes
Check rhythm every
2 minutes; continue
until ALS providers
take over or victim
starts to move

• Amiodarone
• Procainamide

Doses/Details
Synchronized Cardioversion: Begin with 0.5–1 J/kg; if not effective, increase to 2 J/kg.
Sedate if needed, but don’t delay cardioversion.
Adenosine IO/IV Dose:
First dose: 0.1 mg/kg rapid bolus (maximum: 6 mg).
Second dose: 0.2 mg/kg rapid bolus (maximum second
dose 12 mg).
Amiodarone IO/IV Dose:
5 mg/kg over 20–60 minutes. Max dose: 300 mg.
or
Procainamide IO/IV Dose:
15 mg/kg over 30–60 minutes
Do not routinely administer amiodarone and
procainamide together.
