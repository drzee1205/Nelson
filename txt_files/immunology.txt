Orientation to the
­Consideration of Inborn
Errors of Immunity
Soma Jyonouchi and Kathleen E. Sullivan
Primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDDs) comprise more than
450 disorders that impair the development or function of the immune
system. Most these disorders result from a single gene pathogenic variant, although more complex inheritance patterns can also occur.
The initial diagnosis and subsequent treatment of PIDDs are often
delayed due to a low index of suspicion, a rare individual disease incidence, protein manifestations including infection, autoimmunity, cutaneous lesions, and failure to thrive all in the background of a higher
frequency of more common childhood illnesses (nonspecific viral illness, allergy). This diagnostic delay can lead to irreversible end-­organ
damage or death.
Newborn screening for severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)
has helped the early detection of SCID and other immune deficiencies associated with very low T cells. However, the vast majority of
immune deficiencies will not be detected by this method. Physicians
must be aware of concerning manifestations or events that suggest an
underlying PIDD. The varied presentations and complex phenotypes,

some of which have minimal or no infectious manifestations, make
the initial diagnosis of PIDDs difficult (Table 164.1). Manifestations
of PIDD include recurrent and/or sentinel infections, fever without a
focus, periodontitis, poor formation of pus at a site of infection, and
unusual inflammatory (including autoimmune) diseases. PIDDs may
involve defects in one or more host defense mechanism, or they may
be an independent isolated disorder or part of a recognizable syndrome
(Table 164.2).
The immune system is primarily responsible for protecting the
body against invading infectious pathogens. Recurrent (often in multiple sites), severe, or unusual infections are typical presentations of
PIDDs. Viral, bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial infections each
require distinct arms of the immune system for eradication; identification of the microbe causing an infection is helpful in directing the
evaluation of a patient with suspected PIDD (see Table 164.1; Table
164.3). Children who exceed the normal frequency of infections or who
have very prolonged symptoms suggesting failure of pathogen clearance may also warrant evaluation. The typical preschool child can have
6-­10 viral respiratory infections per year, making this assessment less
than straightforward. Patients with PIDD are significantly more likely
to have severe infections requiring hospitalization and prolonged or
unsuccessful treatment with IV antibiotics. Infections with unusual
pathogens (opportunistic organisms) or infections resulting from live
attenuated virus vaccines (rotavirus, varicella, MMR) are important
warning signs. Neutropenia or lymphocytopenia may be present.
In addition to pathogen defense, the immune system must demonstrate tolerance to the host and prevent excessive inflammation that can
result in tissue damage. In addition to infections, patients can present
with autoimmune disease and/or autoinflammatory conditions. The
presence of a family history of PIDD or consanguinity should increase
suspicion for these conditions.
The patient’s clinical presentation can help guide the initial laboratory evaluation (Fig. 164.1).

INFECTION RED FLAGS

Infections are one of the more common reasons to initiate an immunologic evaluation. The pattern and etiology of the infections dictate
the appropriate diagnostic evaluation. A high burden of infections
in a child is the most common reason for referral to an immunology

center; there are certain patterns that can collectively be thought of as
red flags, mandating an immunologic evaluation.

Recurrent Sinopulmonary Infections

Recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections (ear, sinus, pneumonia)
with encapsulated organisms are a common presentation for PIDDs.
It can be challenging to define a number of infections that represent a

threshold to begin an immunologic evaluation. Typically, most patients
with a PIDD will have a diversity of sites impacted by infection; the
frequency will be higher or the severity more severe than the clinician
would expect. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections are highly suggestive of patients with antibody deficiencies, such as common variable
immunodeficiency (CVID; see Chapter 165) or X-­linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA; see Chapter 166). Patients often require longer courses

of antibiotics to clear infections and may not have improvement with
standard interventions such as bilateral myringotomy tubes or sinus
surgery.

Recurrent Invasive Pneumococcal Infections

Invasive pneumococcal infections (sepsis, septic arthritis, meningitis)
may occur in patients with antibody deficiency (Table 164.4). A single
episode need not imply a PIDD. Recurrent invasive pneumococcal
infections should elicit an evaluation. Pneumococcus has a polysaccharide capsule that permits it to evade the immune system. Antibodies bind to these bacteria (opsonization), which facilitates phagocytosis
and bacterial killing. The early complement fragment C3b also opsonizes bacteria, labeling it for destruction. Patients with early classical complement component deficiencies (see Chapter 173) have an
increased risk of invasive infections with encapsulated bacteria such
as pneumococcus. The spleen plays a key role in the phagocytosis
and clearance of nonopsonized bacteria. Thus primary or secondary
asplenia is associated with an increased risk of disseminated infections
with pneumococcus (and meningococcus) requiring patients to take
antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients with toll-­like receptor (TLR) defects
(IRAK4, MyD88, and NEMO deficiency) develop invasive pneumococcal and Staphylococcus aureus infections. These patients uniquely
fail to (or minimally) manifest signs of inflammation (fevers, elevated
CRP, ESR) despite having invasive infections; this is the result of a block
in the pathway that produces inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-­6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-­α, critical for recruitment
of neutrophils and fever generation.

Severe Papillomavirus

A number of PIDDs are characterized by recurrent, severe human
papillomavirus (HPV) infections (see Table 164.3). Warts are common
in the general population but high numbers should suggest a PIDD.
Patients with WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia,
immunodeficiency, myelokathexis) have a unique susceptibility to
HPV-­induced warts in addition to bacterial sinopulmonary infections
and cutaneous abscesses (immunity to other viral infections is intact)
(see Fig. 708.6). One of the hallmarks of DOCK8 deficiency is severe
cutaneous viral infections with HPV, molluscum contagiosum, herpes
simplex, and varicella zoster. Patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis have markedly increased susceptibility to cutaneous HPV
infections. Patients with GATA2 deficiency can suffer from severe disseminated HPV, including genital locations, and molluscum contagiosum infections. Treatment is distinct for each condition, but knowing

the immune etiology is critical because of the substantial morbidity
associated with continually spreading warts.

Herpes Simplex Virus Encephalitis

Several innate PIDDs uniquely present with recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (without mucosal HSV infections) due
to disruption of the signaling pathways regulating antiviral cytokines
interferon (IFN)-­α and -­β, which are critical for control of HSV infections (see Table 164.3). Examples of these PIDDs include TLR3 deficiency, UNC93b deficiency, and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
deficiency. The importance of recognition relates to the likelihood of
recurrence, with the attendant central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction that can result.

Epstein-­Barr Virus

Severe life-­threatening infections with fulminant Epstein-­Barr virus
(EBV) are a hallmark of certain PIDDs, whereas typical outpatient
infectious mononucleosis infections are not concerning (see Chapter
301) (see Table 164.3). Patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have a block in the cytotoxic lymphocyte
(NK and CD8 T cell) pathway necessary to control EBV infections
(see Chapter 556). Patients develop uncontrolled immune hyperactivation (cytokine storm) from unchecked EBV infections resulting
in life-­threatening HLH. Clinical symptoms include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and multi-­system organ failure. There
may be evidence of hemophagocytosis activated by macrophages in
a bone marrow biopsy. Patients with X-­linked lymphoproliferative
syndrome (XLP) are predisposed to fatal fulminant EBV with or without HLH, as well as lymphoma. Patients with XLP who survive acute
EBV infections will often go on to develop hypogammaglobulinemia.
Multiple PIDD disorders have an increased risk of HLH (Table 164.5).
These conditions are more likely to require hematopoietic cell transplantation (see Chapter 176) than HLH occurring in the non-­PIDD
community.

Severe Candida

Severe oral thrush from Candida albicans (as well as other opportunistic infections such a Pneumocystis jiroveci) can be seen in patients
with SCID who have very low CD3 T cells (classically <300) and poor
T-­cell function; this mirrors the clinical phenotype of infants with HIV
who also have low T cells (see Table 164.3). Intact T-­cell IL-­17 immunity is essential for control of Candida infections and overall decrements in the entire T-­cell population or selective defects in the Th17
population are strongly associated with Candida. Patients with specific gene pathogenic variants in IL-­17 signaling (IL-­17RA, IL-­17RC,
IL-­17F, and ACT1) present with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
(CMCC; Candida infections of the skin, nails, mucosa). STAT1 gain-­
of-­function pathogenic variants result in decreased IL-­17 production
that also predisposes patients to skin and mucosal Candida infections.
Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy
(APECED) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in
the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. Patients develop CMCC and
autoimmune endocrine disorders such as hypoparathyroidism and
adrenal insufficiency.

Aspergillus

Neutrophils are responsible for engulfing and killing fungal organisms.
Aspergillus species are a major cause of infections in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a PIDD characterized by defective neutrophil function (see Table 164.3). CGD patients most commonly develop
Aspergillus pneumonia or osteomyelitis, although all sites are susceptible to fungal infection. Aspergillus nidulans infections occur almost
exclusively in CGD and result in a much higher rate of osteomyelitis
and mortality than A. fumigatus. Exposure to Aspergillus through handling of mulch with gardening or exposure to hay can cause fulminant pneumonitis in CGD patients. Patients with GATA2 deficiency
and STAT1 gain-­of-­function pathogenic variants can develop fungal
infections such as aspergillus and histoplasmosis as well as atypical
mycobacteria. Patients with autosomal dominant hyper-­IgE syndrome

(STAT3 deficiency) commonly develop lung pneumatoceles (cavities),
which can then become superinfected with Aspergillus.

Sentinel Bacterial Infections

Certain bacterial infections are considered sentinel infections because
the pathogen is highly associated with specific PIDDs. The following
bacteria are considered highly suspicious for CGD: Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia, Serratia marcescens, Chromobacterium violaceum, and
Granulibacter bethesdensis. Unlike patients with cystic fibrosis, B. cepacia in CGD can cause pneumonia but also rapidly fatal sepsis. Terminal
complement (C5-­C9) and alternative complement defects (properdin or factor D deficiency) have increased susceptibility to recurrent
invasive Neisseria species (recurrent meningococcal and disseminated
gonococcal infections). Complement deficiencies are also found more
frequently in patients with meningitis due to unusual serotypes of
Neisseria.

Mycobacterial Infections

Intact IL-­12 and IFN-­γ signaling is required to activate phagocytes
such as macrophages to clear intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria (see Table 164.3). Patients who have defects along this pathway
such as IL-­12 p40, IL-­12 receptor, and IFN-­γ receptor deficiency present with atypical mycobacterial infections; these infections can spread
to bones and visceral organs (rather than isolated uncomplicated cervical lymphadenitis, which does not suggest a PIDD). STAT1 deficiency
is associated with mycobacterial infections because STAT1 is required
for IFN-­γ signaling. Patients with NEMO deficiency due to pathogenic
variants in IKBKG develop mycobacterial disease due to impaired IL-­
12 production in response to infection and impaired TLR signaling.
Atypical mycobacteria also cause pulmonary disease in patients with
CGD. Patients with the PIDDs mentioned previously born outside
of the United States who receive the bacilli Calmette-­Guérin (BCG)
attenuated vaccine can present with disseminated BCG strain mycobacterial infection often complicating subsequent hematopoietic cell
transplantation.

Severe Cryptosporidia

Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans. Exposure occurs from contaminated drinking water

sources as well as fresh water and public swimming pools. Patients with
PIDD can develop infections outside of the GI tract such as the lungs,
biliary tract, and pancreas. Intact T-­cell immunity appears to play a
critical role in resolution of Cryptosporidium infection as evidenced
by the high incidence of this infection in patients with HIV. PIDDs
with impaired T-­cell immunity are characterized by increased risk for
developing Cryptosporidium. In X-­linked hyper-­IgM syndrome, major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency, DOCK8 deficiency, IL-­21 receptor deficiency, sclerosing cholangitis, and cirrhosis
from chronic Cryptosporidium infection can occur. The presence of
liver disease from Cryptosporidium appears to increase the risk of mortality from curative hematopoietic cell transplantation.

SCHEMA FOR DIAGNOSIS

Clues to the diagnosis of a PIDD may be obtained by the past and current history and the physical exam (Tables 164.6 and 164.7)
Laboratory studies typically used in the diagnosis of PIDD are rudimentary. Typical laboratory studies measure the amount of antibody
or count the numbers of a given cell type (T cells as an example). There
is a relatively limited ability to test function. Figures 164.1 and 164.2
outline a strategy to approach the diagnostic testing for PIDDs.

NONINFECTIOUS PRESENTATIONS SUGGESTING
PIDD

Autoimmunity and inflammation can be indicators of a possible PIDD.
Infections may be falsely attributed to the medications used to control
the autoimmunity or inflammation. Often the usual immunologic testing is normal. Many of the autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders associated with PIDD may need to be identified through genetic
sequencing.

Autoimmunity

Autoimmunity can be the presenting manifestation of a PIDD. Rather
than having the more familiar infectious phenotype, these patients have
defects in tolerance or lymphocyte function that compromise their
homeostasis. HLH is a profound form of immune dysregulation (see
Chapter 556.2). These conditions are important to recognize because
targeted therapies can be beneficial and because they can evolve to
complex phenotypes with severe morbidity. The typical laboratory

evaluations used in the diagnosis of the PIDD are often unrevealing or
minimally abnormal, leading to delay in diagnosis and implementation
of appropriate therapy. The prognosis may be poor; hematopoietic cell
transplantation is recommended.

Early-­Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Prepubertal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is uncommon and
onset of SLE before 5 years of age is exceptionally unusual (Table 164.8);

1257

onset before 5 years of age suggests a monogenic condition such as
early complement component deficiencies (see Chapter 173). Complement deficiencies also have an infection phenotype. SLE is the dominant phenotype for C1 and C4 deficiencies. The mechanism by which
these complement deficiencies lead to susceptibility to SLE is through
impaired clearance of apoptotic material and compromised tolerance.
SLE may present in infancy in C1 and C4 deficiencies and it is typically severe. C2 deficiency, in contrast, is associated with a milder susceptibility to SLE and proportionally higher susceptibility to infection.
Other gene defects associated with early-­onset SLE include lymphocyte
defects such as PRKCD, FAS, and FASL. Manifestations of the interferonopathies such as Aicardi Goutières can resemble SLE and may
have a high rate of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). CNS involvement
and a cutaneous vasculopathy are hallmarks of interferonopathies (see
Chapter 205).

Early-­Onset Enteropathy

Small bowel enteropathy in these conditions is defined as non–gluten
sensitive and associated with villous blunting or atrophy (Table 164.9).
A key component of the differential diagnosis is the congenital diarrheas associated with either solute carrier defects or altered epithelial
function (see Chapter 385). However, many of the solute carrier defects
do not have villous blunting or atrophy. The early-­onset enteropathy
conditions are most often related to T-­cell defects in intolerance and
are classically associated with dysfunctional regulatory T cells such as
in IPEX (immune dysregulation enteropathy X-­linked). Identical but
milder enteropathy is also seen in patients with STAT5B deficiency
and IL2RA deficiency. Both of these molecules are required for critical
signal transduction in regulatory T cells. Although enteropathy is often
the presenting manifestation in these regulatory T-­cell deficiency states,
many of these patients will develop additional autoimmune features.
The progression of autoimmune involvement of different organ systems
can only be altered through hematopoietic cell transplantation. Enteropathy can also be seen in older individuals with one of the immune
dysregulation conditions associated with CVID. In these conditions,
the enteropathy may appear in early childhood or as late as middle age.
The key to suspecting a monogenic immune dysregulation condition is
the finding of villous atrophy that is not gluten-­restriction responsive.
Expanded populations of intraepithelial lymphocytes are also common.

Pleomorphic Autoimmunity

Autoimmunity in children usually does not imply an inherited monogenic condition (Table 164.10). In a setting where there is a strong family history and a suspected autosomal dominant condition, the first
onset of autoimmunity may prompt a genetic evaluation; a single organ
autoimmune disease does not strongly suggest that there is a monogenic condition underlying that autoimmune disease.
Pleomorphic autoimmunity refers to autoimmune disease affecting
multiple organs in a pattern that is not typical for either age of onset
or evolution. SLE can affect a number of organs as can mixed connective tissue disease, but it would be unusual for those conditions to also
be associated with diabetes mellitus or autoimmune hepatitis. When
autoimmunity does not fall cleanly into a particular diagnosis, it is suggestive of pleomorphic autoimmunity.
There is a broad range of defects in T-­and B-­cell tolerance and conditions associated with impaired regulation of T-­cell behavior that can
lead to an array of autoimmune conditions. The organs affected by
autoimmunity typically accrue over time and in a pattern that is not
standard for the known sporadic systemic autoimmune conditions. In
some cases, these conditions may also have peculiar pathologic features that represent a clue that the underlying diagnosis is something
other than a standard autoimmune disease of childhood. Table 164.10
attempts to categorize conditions according to the pathway implicated.
There is wide heterogeneity in the timing of the autoimmune disease,
the penetrance of the disease, and the end organs affected. This combination makes this particular subset of PIDD extraordinarily difficult
to conceptualize. Only a high index of suspicion and the use of genetic
evaluations can identify these patients who will often benefit from targeted therapeutics.

Inflammatory Diseases

Many of the recognized inflammatory diseases are the periodic fever
(autoinflammatory) syndromes (see Chapter 204). Distinguishing
fevers related to infection and those fevers that are driven by endogenous immune dysfunction is often initially difficult. The first contact
with the healthcare system may be by a subspecialist who may only
recognize the initial presenting manifestation. The inflammatory diseases are typically managed according to the pathway that is defective;
therefore the distinction between these conditions and the autoimmune conditions is critically important.

Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease

A key setting where a monogenic inflammatory condition should be
considered is infantile-­onset inflammatory bowel disease or early-­onset
inflammatory bowel disease with additional autoimmune features (see
Chapter 382.1). Overall, approximately 20% of children who develop
inflammatory bowel disease prior to 6 years of age will have a monogenic immune-­based condition. The frequency increases with infantile
onset or with panenteric disease. The diagnosis is most often established through genetic sequencing because the implicated genes are

numerous and diverse (see Chapters 174 and 382.3). These conditions
are managed with targeted biologic or small molecule agents with a
few select patient subsets requiring hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Fever Syndromes

The central feature of the inherited fever syndromes is fever arising
in the absence of infectious trigger (see Chapter 204). Infants and
toddlers may have infections with a frequency of one per month and
take as long as 2 weeks to recover. Nevertheless, the parents will often
remark that the fevers “came out of the blue” or no one else in the
household was ill at the time and express surprise at the frequency with
which their child has been diagnosed with a viral infection with no
viral symptoms. Some of the fever syndromes have fever that is typically isolated with no additional end-­organ effects, whereas others have
fever as a component of a much larger systemic inflammatory picture.
The most familiar inherited fever syndromes are those associated with inflammasome activation and typically treated with IL-­1
inhibitors. A key consideration in the differential diagnosis for
these conditions is the nongenetic condition called periodic fever
aphthous stomatitis pharyngitis adenitis (PFAPA; see Chapter 204).

Although genetic fever syndromes may have a cutaneous component, abdominal pain, or nausea, fever is by far the dominant manifestation. There may be a family history or there may be an ethnic
background that suggests the diagnosis (e.g., familial Mediterranean fever).
Other fever syndromes are related to proteasome dysfunction.
These often have a very strong cutaneous component that can be
a neutrophilic dermatosis or more of a vasculopathic picture with
chilblains affecting the ears, fingers, and toes. Over time, these
conditions may develop lipodystrophy. Fever is often seen in these

conditions before 5 years of age. Treatment often includes a Jak
inhibitor.
In their most severe form, interferonopathies present with the
infantile-­onset leukoencephalopathy called Aicardi Goutières syndrome. There are milder variants leading to interferon production
that can be associated with later onset and a picture more typical for
SLE. The earlier the onset the more likely there is to be significant brain
involvement. These conditions are treated with Jak inhibitors.

the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules; therefore the
randomly generated variable region of the TCR needs to be able to interact with the individual’s MHC molecules. During T-­cell development in
the thymus, only thymocytes with TCRs that recognize the individual’s
MHC molecules are selected to survive (positive selection) and all other
thymocytes die (by neglect). Among the thymocytes that survive, those
with self-­reactive TCRs are eliminated (negative selection) or develop into
regulatory T cells to prevent autoimmune disease (Fig. 165.1). There is a
symbiotic relationship between the thymus and developing thymocytes,
where the absence of a thymus affects T-­cell development and the absence
of thymocytes leads to disruption of the thymic architecture. Pathogenic
gene variants affecting any of the signaling pathways, DNA recombination,
and repair enzymes as well as the thymic environment can lead to T-­cell
and combined immune deficiency diseases.

165.1 Severe Combined Immunodeficiencies
Ramsay L. Fuleihan

T-­CELL AND COMBINED DEFICIENCIES

T lymphocytes (T cells) play a central role in the orchestration and regulation of the adaptive immune response. CD4 T cells help B cells synthesize
specific IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies and develop into memory B cells,
help macrophages kill intracellular pathogens, and regulate the immune
response. CD8 T cells kill virus-­infected or malignant cells. Immune
deficiency diseases that disrupt T-­cell development or function are usually severe, affecting multiple aspects of adaptive immunity, and are thus
combined immune deficiency diseases. A hallmark of the adaptive immune
response is specific recognition of pathogen proteins via antigen receptors,
the T-­cell receptor (TCR) in T cells and immunoglobulin in B cells. Antigen
receptors have a variable region that is formed by random rearrangement
of two to three gene segments, V(D)J, allowing a large variety of antigen
recognition. TCRs recognize a fragment of a protein that is presented by

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is caused by diverse pathogenic gene variants that lead to absence of T-­and B-­cell function. Patients
with this group of disorders have the most severe immunodeficiency.

GENETICS AND PATHOGENESIS

SCID is caused by pathogenic variants in genes crucial for lymphoid
cell development or function (Table 165.1 and Fig. 165.2). All patients
with SCID have very small thymuses that contain no thymocytes and
lack corticomedullary distinction and lack Hassall’s corpuscles. The
thymic epithelium appears histologically normal. Both the follicular
and the paracortical areas of the spleen are depleted of lymphocytes.
Lymph nodes, tonsils, adenoids, and Peyer patches are absent or
extremely underdeveloped.

Fig. 165.1 Schematic representation of T-­
cell development in the thymus. Thymocyte
precursors leave the bone marrow and enter
the thymus with no expression of CD3, CD4, or
CD8 (double negative T cells). Later the thymocytes express CD3 and both CD4 and CD8. If
the newly formed T-­cell receptor (TCR) recognizes major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I or class II molecules, the thymocytes receive a positive selection signal and develop
into CD8 or CD4 single positive thymocytes,
respectively. Single positive thymocytes with
TCR that recognize self-­proteins will be killed
by apoptosis or develop into regulatory T cells
(Treg) to prevent autoimmune disease. Single
positive thymocytes that are non–self-­reactive
leave the thymus as naïve single positive T cells
ready to engage in the immune response when
needed.

pathogenic variants in CD132, autosomal recessive RAG1 and RAG2 deficiencies, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. Additional forms
are listed in Table 165.1. For X-­linked SCID and ADA deficiency, gene
therapy exists, but genetic counseling is the most compelling reason for
genetic sequencing to identify the pathogenic gene variant. Several specific pathogenic gene variants are associated with increased sensitivity to
radiation and chemotherapy, and their early identification can lead to a
better transplant experience by avoiding or reducing dosages of conditioning agents.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

SCID is included in the newborn screening program in all states in the
United States and in several countries around the world. Thus infants
can be identified and treated prior to development of symptoms, which
has dramatically improved the survival of infants with SCID. A few
genetic types of SCID are not detected by newborn screening, and
there are many countries where newborn screening for SCID is not yet

performed. Therefore an awareness of the clinical presentation of SCID
remains important in the early diagnosis and treatment of patients.
When infants with SCID are not detected through newborn screening, they most often present with infection during infancy. Diarrhea,
pneumonia, otitis media, sepsis, and cutaneous infections are common
presentations. Infections with a variety of opportunistic organisms,
either through direct exposure or immunization, can lead to death.
Potential infectious threats include Candida albicans, Pneumocystis
jiroveci (PJP), parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV),
varicella-­zoster virus, measles virus, and attenuated organisms from
the MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella), rotavirus, oral polio,
nasal influenza, yellow fever, or bacille Calmette-­Guérin (BCG) vaccines. Disseminated BCG infection may be the presenting feature of
SCID in countries where the vaccine is given at birth. Infants with SCID
also lack the ability to reject foreign tissue and are therefore at risk for
severe or fatal graft versus host disease (GVHD) from T lymphocytes
in nonirradiated blood products or maternal immunocompetent T cells

vere combined immunodeficiency (SCID) among 216 patients seen
consecutively. (From Buckley RH, Orange JS. Primary immunodeficiency diseases. In: Burks AW, Holgate ST, O’Hehir RE, et al., eds. Middleton’s Allergy: Principles and Practice. 9th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier;
2020. Fig. 69.2, p. 1126.)

A high index of suspicion is very important in the diagnosis of SCID. A
key feature of SCID is that almost all patients will have a low lymphocyte count. Some patients may have a normal lymphocyte count from
proliferation of B cells and/or natural killer (NK) cells. A combination
of infection and a persistently low lymphocyte count is an indication to
test for SCID. The diagnostic strategy both for symptomatic infants and
those detected by newborn screening or with a family history of SCID
is to perform flow cytometry to quantitate the T, B, and NK cells in the
infant (Fig. 165.4). The CD45RA (naïve T-­cell) and CD45RO (memory T-­cell) markers can be helpful to identify patients with maternal
engraftment or Omenn syndrome with predominantly memory T cells.
Identification of a limited TCR repertoire is also helpful in the diagnosis of Omenn syndrome. T-­cell function is often assessed by measuring
proliferative responses to stimulation with mitogens.
Gene sequencing is often done by requesting a SCID gene panel or
a more extensive primary immunodeficiency (PID) gene panel. There
are certain laboratory features that predict specific gene defects. When
both T and B cells are low with normal numbers of NK cells, often a
gene encoding a protein involved in V(D)J recombination is the cause
such as RAG1 and 2. Similarly, certain cytokine receptor defects are
associated with specific SCID lymphocyte phenotypes, such as absent
T cells and NK cells, but normal or elevated numbers of B cells in
X-­SCID caused by pathogenic variants in the common gamma chain
(CD132) of cytokine receptors. Pathogenic variants in Janus kinase
(JAK)3, which signal downstream of CD132, cause an autosomal recessive form of SCID affecting both females and males, with an identical
lymphocyte phenotype as X-­SCID.
The diagnosis of SCID can be established by the presence of a known
pathogenic gene variant, low T-­cell counts with proliferative response
to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) less than 10% of a normal
control, or the identification of maternal T cells in the child. In male
infants, this can be determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) for the X and Y chromosomes.

that crossed the placenta during pregnancy. The latter is usually not
fatal but can be severe. This devastating presentation is characterized by
expansion of the allogeneic cells, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and diarrhea. A third presentation is often called Omenn syndrome, caused by
hypomorphic pathogenic variants in SCID-­causing genes, which allow
few T cells to be generated in the infant that then expand, unregulated,
and cause a clinical picture similar to GVHD (Fig. 165.3) with a severe
dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, and diarrhea. The difference in this case
is that the cells are the infant’s own cells. Dermatitis, especially if it is
difficult to treat, failure to thrive, and infection in the first 6 months of
life, particularly severe infections from commonly mild pathogens or
opportunistic organisms, should raise the suspicion of SCID.
All genetic types of SCID are associated with profound immunodeficiency. A small number have other associated features or atypical
features that are important to recognize. ADA deficiency can be associated with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and chondroosseous dysplasia. Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency causes a picture referred to

Newborn screening for SCID has allowed the early diagnosis and treatment of SCID, improving the outcome of therapy and changing the
natural history of the disease. Newborn screening is based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of T-­cell receptor excision
circles (TRECs), which are formed during V(D)J rearrangement of
the variable region of the TCR chains. These TRECs do not replicate
during cell division; they are thus present in most or all recent thymic emigrants but get diluted out as T cells divide in the periphery.
The TREC assay identifies low numbers of recent thymic emigrants,
which is not diagnostic of SCID, but raises suspicion to proceed with
an evaluation of lymphocyte subsets and function followed by confirmation with genetic testing. Other diseases with low T-­cell counts may
also be identified by newborn screening and include 22Q11.2 deletion
syndrome, Rac2 deficiency, trisomy 21, and idiopathic lymphopenia,
which was not well appreciated until newborn screening was implemented. In many countries, kappa excision circles (KRECs), generated
during B-­cell development, are assayed simultaneously with TRECs
allowing a larger number of types of SCID to be identified as well as
allowing identification of infants with agammaglobulinemia.

TREATMENT

SCID is a true pediatric immunologic emergency. Unless immunologic
reconstitution is achieved through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or gene therapy, death usually occurs during the first
year of life and almost invariably before 2 years of age. HSCT in the
first 100 days of life or in an infant prior to infection is associated with
a 95% survival rate. In patients with SCID, 92% have survived after
T-­cell–depleted parental marrow is given soon after birth when the
infant is healthy, without pretransplant chemotherapy or posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis, although T-­cell reconstitution is improved
with pretransplant conditioning including reduced-­intensity protocols.

Bone marrow transplantation remains the most important and effective therapy for SCID. In ADA-­deficient and X-­linked SCID, there
has been success in correcting the immune defects with ex vivo gene
transfer to autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Initial protocols of
gene therapy for X-­linked SCID resulted in insertional mutagenesis
with the development of leukemic-­like clonal T cells or lymphoma in
some patients. Modification of the gene therapy protocol has greatly
reduced the risk of insertional mutagenesis. ADA-­deficient SCID can
also be treated with enzyme replacement by repeated injections of
polyethylene glycol-­ADA (PEG-­ADA), although the immune reconstitution achieved is not as effective as with HSCT or gene therapy. Until
definitive therapy can be achieved, SCID patients should be treated
with supportive care for prevention and treatment of infections with
immunoglobulin replacement and microbial prophylaxis starting at
4-­6 weeks of age including PJP prophylaxis as well as viral and fungal
prophylaxis. Breastfeeding should be avoided if the mother is CMV or
EBV positive as infection can be transmitted via breast milk.

165.2 Combined Immunodeficiencies
Ramsay L. Fuleihan
Combined immunodeficiency (CID) is distinguished from SCID by the
presence of low but not absent T-­cell function. CID is a syndrome of
diverse genetic causes and, therefore, diverse clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patients with CID may have recurrent or chronic pulmonary
infections, opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, oral or cutaneous
candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, recurrent skin infections, gram-­negative
bacterial sepsis, urinary tract infections, or severe varicella in infancy.
Although they usually survive longer than infants with SCID, patients with
CID fail to thrive and often die before reaching adulthood. Neutropenia

and eosinophilia are common. Serum immunoglobulins may be normal
or elevated for all classes; selective IgA deficiency, marked elevation of IgE,
and elevated IgM levels occur in some cases. Although antibody-­forming
capacity is impaired in most patients, it may not be absent.
Studies of cellular immune function may show lymphopenia, deficiencies of T cells, specific T-­cell subsets, or switched memory B cells,
and extremely low but not absent lymphocyte proliferative responses to
mitogens, antigens, or allogeneic cells in vitro. Peripheral lymphoid tissues may demonstrate paracortical lymphocyte depletion. The thymus
is usually small, with a paucity of thymocytes and usually no Hassall’s
corpuscles.
There is a large number and variety of CIDs caused by pathogenic variants in many different genes. A list of known causes of CID with some of
their characteristic features can be found in Tables 165.2 to 165.7.

COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCIES THAT ARE
GENERALLY LESS PROFOUND THAN SCID

Several types of CID are characterized by a severe immunodeficiency
but affected patients tend to survive longer than patients with SCID
(see Table 165.2). These patients are susceptible to severe viral, opportunistic, and/or fungal infections. Their laboratory features are variable
from normal lymphocyte subsets to a severe deficiency of CD4, CD8,
or both cell types. Invariably, T-­cell function is decreased but proliferative responses to mitogens and, in some cases, to antigens may be
normal, making it difficult to have unifying laboratory characteristics
for this group of diseases. The severity of clinical infection and/or the
presence of a family history of CID should raise suspicion and initiate
a laboratory evaluation for these diseases.

COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY FROM
DEFICIENCY IN CD4 T-­CELL HELPER FUNCTION

CD4 T cells play an important role in orchestrating the immune
response. Helper function from CD4 T cells is critical for immunoglobulin isotype switching, somatic hypermutation, and B-­cell memory

1272 Part XII u Immunology
formation as well as helping macrophages kill intracellular pathogens.
In addition, patients with poor or absent CD4 T-­cell helper function
are susceptible to opportunistic infection. The consequences of defects
in CD40 ligand and CD40 highlight the role CD4 T-­cell–dependent
helper function plays in immunity.

MHC CLASS II DEFICIENCY AND OTHER CAUSES
OF CD4 T-­CELL DEFICIENCY

CD40 LIGAND AND CD40 DEFICIENCY

CD40 ligand (CD154) deficiency (X-­linked) and similarly, CD40 deficiency (autosomal recessive), cause a severe form of hyper-­IgM syndrome that is a CID.

MHC class I and II molecules play an important role in T-­cell development and function by presenting a peptide fragment from a pathogen-­
derived protein to the TCR of CD8 or CD4 T cells, respectively. MHC
class II molecules are required for processing and presentation of peptides derived from exogenous antigens to CD4 T cells and for positive selection of CD4 T cells in the thymus. Therefore MHC class II
deficiency is a severe form of bare lymphocyte syndrome resulting in
decreased CD4 T cells and impairment in their function.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Clinical Manifestations

Pathogenic variants in the CD40 ligand or CD40 genes, disrupt the
interaction between CD4 T cells and antigen-­presenting cells (APCs):
dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. CD40 ligand is
expressed on activated CD4 T cells and delivers signals to APC via
CD40 to stimulate expression of co-­stimulatory molecules that help
T-­cell activation and differentiation, immunoglobulin isotype switching and somatic hypermutation in B cells as well as memory B-­cell
development, and signals to macrophages to kill intracellular pathogens. Therefore disruption of the CD40 signaling pathway affects several key elements of the adaptive immune response leading to a CID
disease characterized by failure of immunoglobulin isotype switching, a process important for synthesis of IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies;
failure of somatic hypermutation, a process by which B cells generate
antibodies of higher affinity; and absent B-­cell memory, susceptibility to opportunistic infections including PJP, and Cryptosporidium and
enhanced susceptibility to some cancers especially of the liver or of
neuroectodermal origin.

Clinical Manifestations

Recurrent and opportunistic infections usually develop in the first year
of life. About half the patients present with PJP pneumonia. Recurrent
bacterial sinopulmonary infections are also common as well as Cryptosporidium infection and sclerosing cholangitis. Chronic or recurrent
neutropenia is also a feature of this disease, although the pathogenesis
of neutropenia is not well known. Patients have a higher susceptibility to
cancer of the liver or biliary tree as well as primitive neuroectodermal carcinoma, which usually develop after the first 10 years of life. Few patients
survive beyond 30 years of age. Some patients with milder genetic variations present in adolescence with parvovirus-­induced aplastic anemia.

Diagnosis

Serum immunoglobulin levels show very low or absent IgG, IgA, and
IgE, with normal or elevated IgM. Some patients have normal serum
IgA levels, likely the result of a non–CD40-­dependent isotype switching mechanism. The term hyper-­IgM is a misnomer because most
patients are identified before they have elevation of serum IgM levels.
Lymphocyte subsets as well as lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens
are usually normal. Characteristically, there is an absence or paucity of
switched memory B cells. Patients may or may not have neutropenia,
which can be severe. Flow cytometry for expression of CD40 on resting
B cells or CD40 ligand on activated T cells can identify patients with
these defects. Staining for CD40 ligand expression with soluble CD40
will identify all CD40 ligand variants that prevent binding to CD40.
Gene sequencing of CD40 and CD40 ligand can be done separately or
within a larger PID gene panel with known pathogenic variants confirming the disease.

Treatment

Patients should be treated with immunoglobulin replacement therapy
and PJP prophylaxis as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Attention
to hygiene and clean drinking water as well as avoiding swimming
in lakes will help prevent exposure to opportunistic organisms such
as Cryptosporidium. HSCT can be curative and is recommended if
the patient has a matched related or unrelated donor. Outcomes after
stem cell transplantation have a trend toward improved survival and a
reduced risk for cancer and improved quality of life.

Patients with low, or occasionally normal, CD4 T-­cell numbers from
MHC class II deficiency are susceptible to bacterial, viral, fungal, and
opportunistic infections. Patients usually present in the first year of
life with respiratory infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive.
Cryptosporidium infections may be associated with sclerosing cholangitis and liver failure.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

MHC class II deficiency results from defects in genes encoding for
transcription factors necessary for expression of MHC class II molecules from the HLA-­DR, HLA-­DP, and HLA-­DQ loci including CIITA,
RFXANK, RFX5, and RFXAP, which explains the concomitant loss of
expression from all three loci.

Diagnosis

Immunodeficiencies with MHC class II deficiency can be identified by
absent or low CD4 T cells on lymphocyte phenotyping by flow cytometry and absent MHC class II molecules. In some cases, CD8 T-­cell
numbers are also decreased. Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens is
normal but absent in response to antigens.

Treatment

The prognosis for MHC class II deficiency is poor with most patients
dying in the first decade of life. HSCT has been performed and
improves CD4 T-­cell proliferation but not numbers because it does not
correct the expression of MHC class II molecules on thymic epithelial
cells. The outcome of HSCT in MHC class II deficiency is not as good
as in SCID and other severe immunodeficiency diseases.

MHC CLASS I DEFICIENCY AND OTHER CAUSES OF
CD8 T-­CELL DEFICIENCY

MHC class I molecules play an important role in T-­cell development and
function by presenting a peptide fragment from an intracellular pathogen, such as viruses, or cancer-­derived proteins to the TCR of CD8 T
cells. In the thymus, MHC class I molecules provide the positive selection signal for thymocytes to develop into CD8 T cells. Therefore the
absence of MHC class I molecules in the thymus (and on all nucleated
cells) is associated with very low or absent CD8 T cells. There are several
other pathogenic gene variants that cause a deficiency in CD8 T cells.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

MHC class I deficiency results from pathogenic variants in the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1 or 2, TAP binding
protein, or β2-­microglobulin genes. The TAP proteins play an important role in allowing the expression of MHC class I molecules on the
surface of all nucleated cells and β2-­microglobulin associates with
MHC class I molecules on the surface of cells.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with low CD8 T cells from MHC class I deficiency may be
asymptomatic in some cases but may present with chronic respiratory
infections including bronchiectasis and granulomatous skin ulcers.

Diagnosis

Immunodeficiency patients with MHC class I deficiency can be identified by absent or low CD8 T cells on lymphocyte phenotyping by flow

cytometry and absent MHC class I molecules. Lymphocyte proliferation is normal.

Treatment

MHC class I deficiency is treated with supportive therapy and avoidance of immunosuppression if possible.

OTHER FORMS OF CD8 DEFICIENCY
CD8 α Gene Defects

CD8 deficiency also results from pathogenic variants in the CD8 α
gene. Patients are susceptible to bacterial and viral respiratory infections. CD8 T-­cell numbers are low and there is an increase in CD4-­
CD8-­T cells. Lymphocyte proliferation is normal. CD8 α deficiency
is also treated with supportive therapy and avoidance of immunosuppression if possible.

Defects in the Zeta-­Associated Protein 70

The zeta-­associated protein (ZAP-­70) is a severe immunodeficiency
similar to SCID with absent or very low numbers of CD8 T cells.
Although CD4 T cells develop in adequate numbers, they are defective in proliferation and function. Patients with ZAP-­70 deficiency are
susceptible to all types of infection including opportunistic infections,
disseminated varicella, and mucocutaneous candidiasis with failure to
thrive and diarrhea. The diagnosis of ZAP-­70 deficiency can be made
by low CD8 T-­cell counts and deficient T-­cell proliferation to mitogens
that can be rescued by bypassing ZAP-­70 signaling with phorbol ester
and ionomycin, helping confirm that the defect is in the proximal signaling pathway in T cells. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification
of a homozygous or combined heterozygous pathogenic variant in the
ZAP-­70 gene. Treatment of ZAP-­70 deficiency requires HSCT. Immunoglobulin replacement and microbial prophylaxis should be initiated
until immune reconstitution after HSCT is achieved.

COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCIES WITH
CONGENITAL THROMBOCYTOPENIA
Wiskott-­Aldrich Syndrome

Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-­linked recessive disorder
characterized by atopic dermatitis, thrombocytopenic purpura with
normal-­appearing megakaryocytes but small defective platelets, and
susceptibility to infection.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

The Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) controls the assembly
of actin filaments required for cell migration and cell-­cell interactions.
Specific pathogenic variants in the WASP gene cause X-­linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) without immunodeficiency and gain-­of-­function
variants cause X-­linked severe congenital neutropenia. A similar phenotype to WAS occurs with pathogenic variants in the WASP interactive Protein (WIP) that is an autosomal recessive disease affecting both
females and males.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients often have prolonged bleeding from the circumcision site
or bloody diarrhea during infancy. The thrombocytopenia is not
caused initially by antiplatelet antibodies, although autoimmunity
may develop later in life. Atopic dermatitis and recurrent infections
usually develop during the first year of life. Streptococcus pneumoniae
and other bacteria having polysaccharide capsules cause otitis media,
pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. Later, infections with agents such
as P. jiroveci and the herpesviruses become more frequent. Infections,
bleeding, and EBV-­associated malignancies are major causes of death.

Diagnosis

The predominant immunoglobulin pattern is a low serum level of
IgM, elevated IgA and IgE, and a normal or slightly low IgG. Percentages of T cells are moderately reduced, and lymphocyte responses
to mitogens are variably depressed. The presence of low numbers of
platelets that are small in size is typical. Immunologically, patients with
this defect uniformly have an impaired humoral immune response to

1273

polysaccharide antigens, as evidenced by absent or greatly diminished
isohemagglutinins, and poor or absent antibody responses after immunization with polysaccharide vaccines. In addition, antibody responses
to protein and conjugate vaccines may also be diminished.

Treatment

Good supportive care includes appropriate nutrition, immunoglobulin replacement, use of killed vaccines, and aggressive management of
eczema and associated cutaneous infections. Because of their profound
antibody deficiency, these patients should be given immunoglobulin
replacement regardless of their serum levels of the different immunoglobulin isotypes. HSCT is the treatment of choice when a high-­quality
matched donor is available and is usually curative. Gene therapy has
resulted in sustained benefits in several patients. As in X-­SCID, early trials of gene therapy were associated with the development of malignancy.
In addition to WAS and WIP deficiency, there is a third cause of
immunodeficiency with thrombocytopenia from pathogenic variants
in the ARPC1B gene affecting Arp2/3-­mediated filament branching
presenting with mild thrombocytopenia but normal-­sized platelets
and recurrent infections. Patients have high IgA and IgE as in WAS.

DNA REPAIR DEFECTS OTHER THAN THOSE
­CAUSING SCID

DNA repair plays an important role during lymphocyte development
and differentiation including V(D)J recombination and immunoglobulin isotype switching. Therefore defects in DNA repair enzyme are
frequently associated with CID and many have other characteristic features to identify them (see Table 165.3).

ATAXIA-­TELANGIECTASIA

Ataxia-­telangiectasia is a complex syndrome with immunologic, neurologic, endocrinologic, hepatic, and cutaneous abnormalities.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

The ataxia-­telangiectasia pathogenic variant (ATM) gene encodes a
protein critical for responses to DNA damage. Cells from patients, as
well as from heterozygous carriers, have increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, defective DNA repair, and frequent chromosomal
abnormalities.
In vitro tests of lymphocyte function have generally shown moderately depressed proliferative responses to T-­and B-­cell mitogens. Percentages of CD3 and CD4 T cells are moderately reduced, with normal
or increased percentages of CD8 T cells and elevated numbers of γ/δ T
cells. The thymus is very hypoplastic, exhibits poor organization, and
lacks Hassall’s corpuscles.

Clinical Manifestations

The most prominent clinical features are progressive cerebellar ataxia,
oculocutaneous telangiectasias, chronic sinopulmonary disease, a high
incidence of malignancy, and variable humoral and cellular immunodeficiency. Ataxia typically becomes evident soon after these children
begin to walk and progresses until they are confined to a wheelchair,
usually by age 10-­12 years. The telangiectasias begin to develop at 3-­6
years of age, contributing to a delay in diagnosis. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections occur in approximately 80% of patients. Although common viral infections have not usually resulted in untoward sequelae,
fatal varicella has occurred. The malignancies associated with ataxia-­
telangiectasia are usually of the lymphoreticular type, but adenocarcinomas also occur. Carriers of pathogenic variants have an increased
incidence of malignancy.

Diagnosis

Patients have elevated serum α-­fetoprotein levels. The most frequent
humoral immunologic abnormality is the selective absence of IgA,
which occurs in 50–80% of these patients. IgG2 or total IgG levels may
be decreased, and specific antibody levels may be decreased or normal. Some patients have an elevated serum IgM level. Identification
of homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the
ATM gene confirms the diagnosis.

1274 Part XII u Immunology
Treatment

Therapy in ataxia-­telangiectasia is supportive but includes immunoglobulin replacement and avoidance of ionizing radiation unless absolutely necessary to establish a clinical diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.

Immunoosseous Dysplasias

Immunoosseous dysplasias are a group of combined immune deficiency diseases affecting bone development as well as T-­cell development or function. They are characterized by skeletal abnormalities and
recurrent infections (see Table 165.4).

CARTILAGE-­HAIR HYPOPLASIA

Cartilage-­hair hypoplasia (CHH) is an unusual form of metaphyseal
dysplasia with frequent and severe infections. It occurs with a high
frequency among the Amish and Finnish people (Chapter 741).

Genetics and Pathogenesis

CHH is an autosomal recessive condition. Numerous pathogenic variants that cosegregate with the CHH phenotype have been identified in
the untranslated RNase MRP (RMRP) gene. The RMRP endoribonuclease consists of an RNA molecule bound to several proteins and has
at least two functions: cleavage of RNA in mitochondrial DNA synthesis
and nucleolar cleaving of pre-­RNA. Defects in RMRP cause CHH by
disrupting a function of RMRP RNA that affects multiple organ systems. In vitro studies show decreased numbers of T cells and defective T-­cell proliferation because of an intrinsic defect related to the G1
phase, resulting in a longer cell cycle for individual cells. NK cells are
increased in number and function.

Clinical Manifestations

Clinical features include short, pudgy hands; redundant skin; hyperextensible joints of hands and feet but an inability to extend the elbows
completely; and fine, sparse, light hair and eyebrows. Infections range
from mild to severe (Fig. 165.5). Associated conditions include deficient erythrogenesis, Hirschsprung disease, and an increased risk of
malignancies. The bones radiographically show scalloping and sclerotic or cystic changes in the metaphysis and flaring of the costochondral junctions of the ribs.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of CHH is suspected by the clinical constellation of skeletal dysplasia and immune deficiency and supporting laboratory findings. Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in
the RMRP gene confirms the diagnosis.

Treatment

Treatment of CHH is supportive. Some patients have been treated with
HSCT, which will correct the T-­cell immunodeficiency and erythrogenesis but will not affect other organ systems.

ANHIDROTIC ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA WITH
IMMUNODEFICIENCY

Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-­ID) is a
CID characterized by susceptibility to infection, thin sparse hair, abnormal
dentition (conical teeth), and absence of salivary gland (Chapter 690).

Genetics and Pathogenesis

X-­linked EDA-­ID results from hypomorphic gene variants in the IKKγ
gene that encodes the NF-­κB essential modulator (NEMO). Complete
loss-­of-­function (LOF) variants are deleterious early in embryogenesis. Carriers of LOF variants have features of incontinentia pigmenti.
NEMO is a member of the IKK complex that phosphorylates the
inhibitor of NF-­κB (IκB), which then allows NF-­κB to translocate to
the nucleus and turn on gene expression. In lymphocytes, NF-­κB is
involved in signaling via the antigen receptors, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, and toll-­like receptors as well as the interleukin (IL)-­1 receptor. Defects in NEMO affect both the innate and
adaptive immune systems and can be severe. Autosomal dominant
gain-­of-­function variants in IκBα also result in a similar phenotype

Fig. 165.5 Metaphyseal dysplasia, McKusick type. Note the fine,

sparse hair and short limbs. (From Jones KL, Jones MC, Del Campo M.
Smith’s Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation. 8th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2022. Fig.1, p. 529.)

that affects both females and males as well as gain-­of-­function variants
in IKBKB. The latter is also associated with recurrent bacterial, viral,
and fungal infections, but the ectodermal defects are variable.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with EDA-­ID suffer from recurrent and severe infections from
gram-­positive and gram-­negative bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, and
fungi. Patients have thin sparse hair and conical teeth and may have colitis. More severe variants may be associated with osteopetrosis and lymphedema; their disease is termed OL-­EDA-­ID (osteopetrosis, lymphedema,
EDA-­ID).

Diagnosis

The diagnosis can be suspected from the clinical features of anhidrosis, ectodermal dysplasia, and recurrent infections. Patients frequently
present with hypogammaglobulinemia as in the hyper-­IgM syndrome
because CD40 signaling involves NF-­κB, with elevated IgM in some
patients. Most if not all patients have poor NK cell function. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identification of hypomorphic variants in
the IKKγ gene or gain-­of-­function variants in the IκBα gene.

Treatment

Patients are usually treated with immunoglobulin replacement and
close monitoring. The outcome is dependent on the severity of the
phenotype. HSCT has been successful in some patients, but it may not
correct the colitis or other features of the disease.

Calcium Channel Defects

Calcium signaling plays an important role in T-­cell activation, where initially calcium is released from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, which is sensed by STIM1 that in turn activates calcium release
activated channels (CRACs), which are made up of the pore-­forming subunit ORAI-­1, to bring in additional calcium from outside the cell. Intracellular calcium activates calcium-­dependent enzymes including calcineurin,
which activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which

translocates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription including IL-­2
and the CD40 ligand. Pathogenic variants in ORAI-­1 or STIM1 result in
a CID associated with hypotonia because calcium is also important for
muscle function.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with calcium channel defects have recurrent and severe infections
with bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They typically have pneumonia but may
present with a variety of infections including BCG lymphadenitis, chronic
rotavirus diarrhea, and mucocutaneous candidiasis. They may also present
with failure to thrive, ectodermal dysplasia defective dental enamel, and
mydriasis. Patients also have a nonprogressive hypotonia.

Diagnosis

Patients have normal numbers of T cells, but the T cells have decreased
or have absent proliferation to mitogens, antigens, or anti-­
CD3.
Although serum immunoglobulins are normal or increased, specific
antibody levels are diminished and NK cell function may also be
decreased as B cells and NK cells also depend on calcium signaling
for their activation. The clinical features and laboratory test results are
similar for both ORA-­1 and STIM1 deficiency. Therefore genetic testing is required to identify the specific pathogenic variants, which will
aid in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

Treatment

HSCT is the optimal treatment for the immunodeficiency; however,
it does not correct the hypotonia, which may contribute to recurrent
pneumonia.

165.3 Thymic Disorders
Ramsay L. Fuleihan
The thymus is the organ where T-­cell development occurs and central T-­cell tolerance to self-­proteins develops by negative selection of
self-­reactive thymocytes or development of regulatory T cells. Defects
in thymic development affect T-­cell development causing a variable
degree of T-­cell immunodeficiency and are associated with higher risk
for the development of autoimmunity.

DIGEORGE/VELOCARDIOFACIAL SYNDROME/
CHROMOSOME 22Q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME
(22Q11.2DS)

Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common of the
T-­cell disorders, occurring in about 1 in 3,000 births in the United
States. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletions disrupt development of
the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches during early embryogenesis, leading to hypoplasia or aplasia of the thymus and parathyroid
glands. Other structures forming at the same age are also frequently
affected, resulting in anomalies of the great vessels (right-­sided aortic arch), esophageal atresia, bifid uvula, congenital heart disease
(conotruncal, atrial, and ventricular septal defects), a short philtrum
of the upper lip, hypertelorism, an antimongoloid slant to the eyes,
mandibular hypoplasia, and posteriorly rotated ears (see Chapter 99)
(Fig. 165.6). With advanced fetal ultrasound and fetal echocardiography, the diagnosis is often identified prenatally. Other patients may
be identified by low TREC counts on newborn screening for SCID or
sometimes by the development of hypocalcemic seizures during the
neonatal period.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Chromosome 22q11.2 deletions occur with high frequency because
complex repeat sequences that flank the region represent a challenge
for DNA polymerase. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and occurs with comparable frequency in all populations.
Within the deleted region, haplosufficiency for the TBX1 transcription
factor appears to underlie the majority of the phenotype. The phenotype is highly variable; a subset of patients has a phenotype that has

Fig. 165.6 Typical facial appearance of a child with DiGeorge syn-

drome. Notice the microstomia, hypertelorism, upturned nose, and posteriorly rotated and small, low-­set ears. (From Chinn IK, Chinen J, Shearer
WT. Primary immunodeficiency diseases. In: Cherry JD, Harrison GJ, Kaplan SL, et al., eds. Feigin and Cherry’s Textbook of Pediatric Infectious
Diseases. 8th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2019. Fig. 67.1, p. 641.)

also been called DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, or
conotruncal anomaly face syndrome.
Variable hypoplasia of the thymus occurs in 75% of the patients with
the deletion, which is more frequent than total aplasia; aplasia is present
in <1% of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Slightly less than half
of patients with complete thymic aplasia are hemizygous at chromosome
22q11.2. Approximately 15% are born to diabetic mothers. Another 15% of
infants have no identified risk factors. Approximately 30% of infants with
complete DiGeorge syndrome have CHARGE association (coloboma,
heart defect, choanal atresia, growth or developmental retardation, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies including deafness). Pathogenic variants
in the chromodomain helicase DNA-­binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene on
chromosome 8q12.2 are found in approximately 60–65% of individuals
with CHARGE syndrome; some have pathogenic variants in SEMA3E.

Clinical Manifestations

Children with partial thymic hypoplasia may have little trouble with infections and grow normally. Patients with thymic aplasia (complete DiGeorge
syndrome) resemble patients with SCID in their susceptibility to infections
with low-­grade or opportunistic pathogens, including fungi, viruses, and
P. jiroveci, and to GVHD from nonirradiated blood transfusions. Patients
with thymic aplasia can develop an atypical phenotype in which oligoclonal T-­cell populations appear in the blood associated with rash and
lymphadenopathy. These atypical patients appear phenotypically similar to
patients with Omenn syndrome or maternal T-­lymphocyte engraftment.
It is critical to ascertain in a timely manner whether an infant has thymic aplasia, because this disease is fatal without treatment. A T-­cell count
should be obtained on all infants born with primary hypoparathyroidism,
CHARGE syndrome, and conotruncal cardiac anomalies with syndromic
features. Some but not all infants are identified by newborn screening for
SCID and when 22q11.2 deletion is suspected, a calcium level should be
obtained at the time of T-­cell evaluation. The three manifestations with the
highest morbidity in early infancy are profound immunodeficiency, severe
cardiac anomaly, and seizures from hypocalcemia. Thus an early focus
on these concerns is warranted even before the diagnosis is confirmed.
Affected patients may also develop autoimmune cytopenias, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, atopy, and malignancies (lymphomas).

1276 Part XII u Immunology
Diagnosis

The clinical features of DiGeorge/CHARGE/22Q11.2DS will help in
establishing the diagnosis, but there is a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. In most patients, absolute lymphocyte counts are usually only
moderately low for age. The CD3 T-­cell counts are variably decreased in
number, corresponding to the degree of thymic hypoplasia. Lymphocyte responses to mitogen stimulation are absent, reduced, or normal,
depending on the degree of thymic deficiency. Immunoglobulin levels
are often normal, but there is an increased frequency of IgA deficiency,
low IgM levels, and some patients develop progressive hypogammaglobulinemia. FISH for 22Q11.2 may identify patients with 22Q11.2DS
as well as the more sensitive DNA microarray. Pathogenic variants in
TBX1 may be found in DiGeorge syndrome, and pathogenic variants
in CHD7 or SEMA3E in CHARGE syndrome.

Treatment

The immunodeficiency in thymic aplasia is correctable by cultured
allogenic (donor derived) thymic tissue transplants. Following thymic
tissue transplantation, a cytokine release syndrome may develop. Some
infants with thymic aplasia have been given nonirradiated unfractionated bone marrow or peripheral blood transplants from a human leukocyte antigen–identical sibling, with subsequent improved immune
function because of adoptively transferred T cells. Infants and children
with low T-­cell counts but not low enough to consider transplantation
should be monitored for evolution of immunoglobulin defects as well
as autoimmunity. Infections in these patients are multifactorial. Their
anatomy may not favor drainage of secretions; they have a higher rate
of atopy, which may complicate infections; and their host defense may
allow persistence of infections. Interventions range from hand hygiene,
probiotics, prophylactic antibiotics, and risk management to immunoglobulin replacement for those who have demonstrated defective
humoral immunity. Live-­viral vaccines should be avoided until adequate CD4 and CD8 T-­cell counts are confirmed and normal response
to antigens is documented with T-­cell proliferation to antigens or a
protective antibody response to a protein vaccine such as tetanus.

165.4 Inborn Errors of Immunity with a
Strong Atopic Diathesis
Ramsay L. Fuleihan

AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT HYPER-­IgE SYNDROME
STAT3 DEFICIENCY (JOB SYNDROME)

This syndrome is associated with early-­onset atopy and recurrent skin
and lung infections.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

The autosomal dominant hyper-­IgE syndrome is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the gene encoding signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). These pathogenic variants result
in a dominant negative effect. The many clinical features are caused by
compromised signaling downstream of the IL-­6, type I interferon, IL-­
22, IL-­10, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors.

Clinical Manifestations

The characteristic clinical features are staphylococcal abscesses, pneumatoceles, osteopenia, and unusual facial features. There is a history from
infancy of recurrent staphylococcal abscesses involving the skin, lungs,
joints, viscera, and other sites. Persistent pneumatoceles develop as a result
of recurrent pneumonia. Patients often have a history of sinusitis and mastoiditis. C. albicans is the second most common pathogen. Allergic respiratory symptoms are usually absent. The pruritic dermatitis that occurs is
not typical of atopic eczema and does not always persist. There can be a
prominent forehead, deep-­set wide-­spaced eyes, a broad nasal bridge, a

Fig. 165.7 Mucocutaneous inflammation and infections in DOCK8-­
HIES. Severe eczema, molluscum contagiosum and fungal skin infections, and benign tumorous mucosa proliferations progressing from the
inner eyelid and from oral mucosa are clinical signs of DOCK8-­HIES.
(From Hagl B, Heinz V, Schlesinger A, et al. Key findings to expedite the

wide fleshy nasal tip, mild prognathism, facial asymmetry, and hemihypertrophy, although these are most evident in adulthood. In older children,
delay in shedding primary teeth, recurrent fractures, and scoliosis occur.
These patients demonstrate an exceptionally high serum IgE concentration; usually normal concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM; pronounced
blood and sputum eosinophilia; and poor antibody and cell-­mediated
responses to neoantigens. Although IgE levels >2,000 IU/mL are characteristic, IgE levels may fluctuate and even decrease in adulthood. In neonates and infants with the pruritic pustular dermatosis, IgE levels will be
elevated for age and are usually in the 100s. In vitro studies show normal
percentages of blood T, B, and NK lymphocytes, except for a decreased
percentage of T cells with the memory (CD45RO) phenotype and an
absence or deficiency of T-­helper type 17 (Th17) cells. Most patients have
normal T-­lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens but very low
or absent responses to antigens or allogeneic cells from family members.
Blood, sputum, and histologic sections of lymph nodes, spleen, and lung
cysts show striking eosinophilia. Hassall’s corpuscles and thymic architecture are normal.

Treatment

Therapy is generally directed at prevention of infection using antimicrobials including antibiotics and antifungals as well as immunoglobulin replacement.

DOCK8 DEFICIENCY

Deficiency of DOCK8 (dedicator of cytokinesis 8) is an autosomal
recessive severe immunodeficiency that most often presents with
impressively severe eczema in infancy and toddlerhood, food allergy,
and eosinophilic esophagitis. Patients commonly have cutaneous viral
infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella, or molluscum
contagiosum; susceptibility to infection by CMV and EBV; recurrent
pneumonia leading to bronchiectasis; and opportunistic infections
with PJP. In some patients, cryptosporidia causes sclerosing cholangitis
(Fig. 165.7). The infectious susceptibility tends to worsen over time,
as do the laboratory features of immune dysfunction, most often low
T-­cell counts and poor proliferative function. Serum IgE levels tend to
be elevated with eosinophilia, whereas other immunoglobulin levels
may be decreased, especially IgM. Specific antibody levels are variably
decreased. Patients are also susceptible to autoimmune disease as well
as cancer. Although these patients can survive to adulthood without
transplantation, they suffer many complications and their quality of life
is often poor. For this reason, most patients are now transplanted early
in life to avoid the later complications.

Chapter 166 u B-Cell and Antibody Deficiencies

Chapter 166

B-Cell and Antibody
Deficiencies
Vivian P. Hernandez-­Trujillo and
Camile Ortega
Of the primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDDs), those affecting
antibody production are the most prevalent. Selective absence of IgA
is the most common defect, with rates ranging from 1 in 333 to 1 in
18,000 persons among different races and ethnicities. Patients with
antibody deficiency are usually recognized because they have recurrent
infections with encapsulated bacteria, predominantly in the upper and
lower respiratory tracts. Some individuals with selective IgA deficiency
or infants with transient hypogammaglobulinemia may have few or
no infections. These conditions have a complex and likely polygenic
inheritance, as do the common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
syndromes. The gene defects for many primary antibody deficiency
disorders have been identified (Table 166.1). Sometimes the defect is
not in the B cell itself but in T cells, which are required for complete
B-­cell function. Some disorders are caused by unknown factors or are
secondary to an underlying disease or its treatment.

166.1 Agammaglobulinemia
Vivian P. Hernandez-­Trujillo and Camile Ortega

X-­LINKED AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA

Patients with X-­linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), or Bruton agammaglobulinemia, have a profound defect in B-­
lymphocyte development resulting in severe hypogammaglobulinemia, an absence
of circulating B cells, small to absent tonsils, and no palpable lymph
nodes. These patients present with an increased susceptibility to infection (Fig. 166.1) and have increased risk of neutropenia and autoimmunity, particularly presenting as colitis.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

The variant gene in XLA maps to q22 on the long arm of the X chromosome and encodes the B-­cell protein tyrosine kinase Btk (Bruton tyrosine kinase). Btk is a member of the Tec family of cytoplasmic protein
tyrosine kinases and is expressed at high levels in all B-­lineage cells,
including pre-­B cells. Some pre-­B cells are found in the bone marrow,
but the percentage of peripheral blood B lymphocytes is <1%. The percentage of T cells is increased, ratios of T-­cell subsets are normal, and
T-­cell function is intact. The thymus is normal.
Several autosomal recessive defects have also been shown to result in
agammaglobulinemia with an absence of circulating B cells (see Table
166.1; Table 166.2), including pathogenic variants in the genes encoding
the (1) μ heavy chain gene; (2) Igα and (3) Igβ signaling molecules; (4)
B-­cell linker adaptor protein (BLNK); (5) surrogate light chain, λ5/14.1;
(6) leucine-­rich repeat-­containing 8 (LRRC8); (7) p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol-­3 kinase; (8) p110 δ subunit of phosphatidylinositol-­3
kinase; (9) TCF3; (10) SLC39A7; and (11) TOP2B. These are rare but
are clinically indistinguishable from the X-­linked form (see Fig. 166.1).

Clinical Manifestations/Complications

Most males afflicted with XLA remain well during the first 6-­9 months
of life by virtue of maternally transmitted IgG antibodies. Thereafter
they acquire infections with extracellular pyogenic organisms, such as
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, unless they are

1277

given prophylactic antibiotics or immunoglobulin therapy. Infections
include sinusitis, otitis media, pneumonia, or, less often, sepsis or meningitis (Fig. 166.2). Infections with Mycoplasma are also particularly
problematic, specifically as they can affect the joints. Chronic fungal
infections are seen; Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia rarely occurs.
Viral infections are usually handled normally, with the exceptions
of hepatitis viruses and enteroviruses. There are examples of paralysis when live polio vaccine was administered to these patients, and
chronic, eventually fatal, central nervous system (CNS) infections with
various echoviruses and coxsackieviruses have occurred in a significant
number of patients. An enterovirus-­associated myositis resembling
dermatomyositis has also been observed. Enteroviral encephalitis can
also be life-­threatening in patients with XLA. Neutropenia, typically
seen at diagnosis when infected, can be associated with Pseudomonas
or staphylococcal infections. In addition, Pseudomonas can lead to
severe and life-­threatening invasive infections. Giardia can also lead to
diarrhea and weight loss. A sudden decrease in serum IgG level should
prompt an evaluation for Giardia.
Long-­term complications include bronchiectasis and colitis, presenting like an inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal (GI) disease has been increasingly reported in patients with XLA. Although
immune globulin replacement decreased severe infectious complications, the chronic lung disease persisted in a recent cohort study. In
addition, in a separate cohort, infections were highest before initiation
of antibody replacement; however, patients continued to have infections despite adequate IgG levels.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of XLA should be suspected if lymphoid hypoplasia is
found on physical examination (minimal or no tonsillar tissue and no
palpable lymph nodes), and serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM,
and IgE are far below the 95% confidence limits for appropriate age-­
and race-­matched controls; total immunoglobulins are usually <100
mg/dL. Levels of natural antibodies to type A and B red blood cell
polysaccharide antigens (isohemagglutinins) and antibodies to antigens given during routine immunizations are abnormally low in XLA,
whereas they are typically normal in transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. In infants below the age of 6 months, care should
be taken when interpreting normal IgG, which can represent maternal
IgG passed in utero. In this case, flow cytometry is essential in making
the diagnosis of XLA. Flow cytometry is an important test to demonstrate the absence of circulating B cells, which will distinguish XLA
from most types of CVID, the hyper-­IgM syndrome, and transient
hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (Fig. 166.3). Genetic testing is
also available to detect absence of Btk.

AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA

Autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia (ARA) is a clinically indistinguishable disorder from XLA presenting in males and females. The successful assembly and subsequent signaling capacity of the pre-­B cell receptor
complex (pre-­BCR) in the bone marrow is central to the production of B
cells and antibody-­secreting plasma cells. A pathogenic variant in any of
the components of the pre-­BCR, or in the downstream signaling cascade,
results in these rare forms of agammaglobulinemia (see Fig. 166.1).

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Hematopoietic stem cells develop into B cells in the bone marrow.
The maturation into antibody-­secreting plasma cells occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissues. B-­cell development relies on a tightly regulated
sequence of events from the pro-­B cell stage to the formation of the
pre-­BCR and onward (see Fig. 166.1).
The pre-­BCR is composed of the membrane form of the μ heavy
chain, the surrogate light chain composed of VpreB and λ5/14.1 and
the immunoglobulin-­associated signal transducing chains, Igα and
Igβ. An autosomal pattern of inheritance occurs in approximately
10% of agammaglobulinemic syndromes, and, in some affected families, there is known consanguinity. Approximately half of these pathogenic variants are in μ heavy (IGHM) and have a clinical picture that

Fig. 166.1 B-­cell development defects in primary antibody deficiencies (PADs) result from developmental defects that are either B-­cell specific or

affect several hematopoietic cell lineages. B-­cell development occurs in the bone marrow, where hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo B-­cell
lineage specification. Some autosomal-­recessive forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are associated with an early defect in both B
and T cells and are diagnosed in the first few months or years of life. For example, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency leads to an accumulation of adenosines and thus the death of the lymphocytes. Moreover, adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency (also known as reticular dysgenesis) is a
metabolic defect that mostly affects T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and (in some cases) B cells. It is associated with very early onset
hypogammaglobulinaemia or even agammaglobulinaemia. Dyskeratosis congenita is caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the
telomerase or shelterin complexes; it is a rare inherited bone-­marrow failure syndrome that leads to progressive B-­and T-­cell lymphopenia and
hypogammaglobulinaemia. Finally, mutations in GATA2 (which encodes a transcription factor required for early differentiation of hematopoietic cells
in the bone marrow) also lead to B-­cell, dendritic cell, monocyte, and NK cell deficiencies. Successive B-­cell differentiation stages are characterized by ordered gene expression and stochastic immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. The V(D)J recombination of the immunoglobulin locus is
achieved by the lymphocyte-­specific RAG molecules and the non–lymphocyte-­specific nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) complex and leads to
the expression of the pre-­B cell receptor (BCR). Defects in V(D)J recombination (as observed in RAG deficiency and NHEJ deficiency) typically result
in the absence of mature B and T cells. The pre-­BCR is affected in these cases, leading to PADs as V(D)J recombination is required for heavy chain
expression. The dashed lines indicate a block of differentiation. BLNK, B-­cell linker; Btk, Bruton tyrosine kinase; CMP, common myeloid progenitor;

is similar to XLA. Variants in the genes encoding for Igα (CD79a), Igβ
(CD79b), λ5 (IGLL1), BLNK, and p85α (PI3KR1) have been identified
as other, more rare, causes for ARA in humans (see Fig. 166.1). Autosomal dominant forms of agammaglobulinemia have also been identified
in patients with an unusual phenotype characterized by an increased
expression of CD19, but with the absence of the BCR. Genetic studies demonstrated a de novo variant in the broadly expressed transcription factor E47, which functions as a quality control mechanism
of enforcing a block to prevent cells that lack a pre-­BCR from further
development.

Clinical Manifestations

Absent peripheral B cells and severe hypogammaglobulinemia due to a
developmental arrest at the pro-­B stage to pre-­B stage is characteristic
of ARA. Although these patients generally have clinical findings that
are indistinguishable from Btk mutations, patients with the pathogenic
variants in any of the components of the BCR leading to ARA tend
to have a more severe phenotype. ARA is diagnosed at a mean age of
11 months, rather than 35 months in patients with XLA. There is also
a higher incidence of enteroviral infections and Pseudomonas sepsis
with neutropenia. These differences suggest there is protective value in

the small amount of immunoglobulins produced by patients with XLA.
Treatment using immunoglobulin and aggressive use of antibiotics is
identical to that for patients with XLA.

Diagnosis

Due to the early B-­cell developmental arrest, ARA variants have been
associated with the complete absence of CD19+ B cells in the peripheral circulation and profound hypogammaglobulinemia. Identifying a
genetic cause of ARA is challenging, and there is a need for a better
understanding of susceptibility genes and modifying genetic factors.
The goal of further areas of investigation should include the identification of variant genes in patients who do not appear to have defects in
the genes already associated with immunodeficiency.
Whole genome sequencing will greatly facilitate the molecular diagnosis of abnormalities in additional genes that can cause ARA.

XLA affects males, as it is an X-­linked disorder. The inheritance patterns include all female offspring as carriers, and none of the male
offspring will be affected. Autosomal recessive forms of agammaglobulinemia result in both males and females affected, as each parent passes
on the affected gene. Patients with agammaglobulinemia tend to have
more severe disease, often presenting earlier in life compared with

patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, specific antibody deficiency
(SAD), or CVID.
Treatment with antibody replacement and prophylactic antibiotics
for patients with any form of agammaglobulinemia is essential in preventing infections and will be further reviewed later.

Patients with low IgG may present at different ages. Hypogammaglobulinemia results from low, but not absent, levels of serum immunoglobulins. If a patient is diagnosed with a specific pathologic genetic variant,
this aids in making a specific diagnosis. Otherwise, in patients with a
low IgG, the diagnosis may be arbitrary when considering the differential
of hypogammaglobulinemia, SAD, and CVID (Tables 166.3 and 166.4).

HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA

1281

The most common types of PIDD are antibody deficiencies characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections and are
usually present in childhood. Primary hypogammaglobulinemia represents a spectrum of disease, with more severe phenotypes characterized
by profound hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemic states,
as was described in the previous section. SAD and CVID are presented
in the following sections, and onset may occur later in childhood and
adolescence. This is in contrast to transient hypogammaglobulinemia
of infancy, which presents in the first few months of life.
The secondary forms are more common in adults and are a result
of decreased production or increased loss. Decreased production can
be drug induced (rituximab, glucocorticoids, and antiepileptics), from
malignancy or premalignant disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or Waldenström macroglobulinemia),
and from Good syndrome (thymoma with hypogammaglobulinemia).

Infants demonstrate robust antibody responses to protein antigens
through T-­cell–dependent activation. Response to purified polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) does not involve T-­cell activation, and is only considered to be fully developed by 2 years of age. The response to protein
antigens, including those contained in the protein conjugated vaccines
(PCVs), typically remains intact in patients with SAD. In SAD, some
patients’ lack of response to PPV may represent physiologic immaturity of the immune system, and may resolve over time. In SAD patients
with recurrent infections requiring antibiotics, there is likely an underlying immunologic abnormality. The cause for this delay in maturation
remains unknown. Abnormalities in a specific pathogen-­associated
molecular pathway may be responsible for the variability in which individuals respond to specific protein or polysaccharide antigens despite
normal total immunoglobulin levels. A number of cellular pathways
produce antibodies against purified or conjugate polysaccharides and
are likely to be altered by different defects. The response seen to PPV,
which can occur in patients who lack a response to PCV, demonstrates
how conjugate and purified polysaccharides induce antibodies through
different activation pathways. The variation in phenotypes of SAD also
supports the likelihood of different pathogenic mechanisms resulting
in polysaccharide antibody deficiencies. The use of large-­scale DNA
studies, along with IgM memory and class-­switched memory B cells as
immunologic markers, is expected to provide useful information for
the evaluation and management of patients with SAD in the future.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with SAD present in a manner consistent with those with
defects of humoral immunity. Frequent, severe, or prolonged sinopulmonary infections are most common. Rapid recurrence of infection
on discontinuation of antibiotics, following initial improvement, is
also common. Invasive and life-­threatening infections are not frequent.
Approximately half of children show resolution of SAD in 3 years and
treatment may be temporary. A new diagnosis of SAD during adolescence or adulthood could indicate a previously missed diagnosis or
progression of a mild phenotype. Pathogen susceptibility is not specific and not limited to S. pneumoniae. Other encapsulated bacteria,
(H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis), Staphylococcus aureus and
respiratory viruses cause significant disease in SAD.
SAD patients with allergic disease are among the most challenging
to identify due to increased risk of sinopulmonary infections resulting from persistent inflammation and anatomic dysfunction associated
with asthma and rhinitis. It is important to consider underlying SAD in
this population, as IgE-­mediated sensitization is only present in some
of these patients. Mucociliary or anatomic defects should also be considered in those who have developed high titers in response to natural
infection, but maintain an abnormal pattern of infections.
Although lack of antibody response to polysaccharide antigens
is found frequently in patients without any associated immune deficiency, selective antibody deficiencies are also common in patients
with known PIDDs with normal total immunoglobulin levels such as
ataxia telangiectasia, asplenia, hyper-­IgE syndrome, selective IgA deficiency, IgG subclass deficiencies, Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome, and partial DiGeorge syndrome. A subset of adolescents and adults with SAD
may progress to more severe forms of PIDD, including other forms of
hypogammaglobulinemia and CVID.

Diagnosis

The gold standard for the diagnosis of SAD involves evaluating
the response to the 23-­
valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). In patients immunized with protein conjugated

pneumococcal vaccines (PCV-­7, PCV-­13, PCV-­10, PCV-15, PCV-20),
the evaluation must be based on the serotypes not present in conjugate
vaccines. In unimmunized patients, a complete absence of protective
titers to all serotypes is unusual, as most individuals would be expected
to have developed some in response to natural infection by 2 years of
age. The standard and reproducible method used for analysis is the
third-­generation World Health Organization enzyme-­linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the antigens are individual serotype
specific capsular polysaccharides of pneumococci. Antibody titers are
expressed as mg/mL and although titers as low as 0.35 mg/mL have
been considered protective against invasive infections, a titer of 1.3
mg/mL is used as the threshold of response to PPV23 and generally
considered protective against mucosal infections. Four different phenotypes of SAD have been described based on the response to the
available pneumococcal vaccines: mild, moderate, severe, and memory. Although all phenotypes presume an abnormal pattern of infection, severity or susceptibility to infection may or may not correlate
clinically. The severe phenotype is defined as nearly absent protective
titers to ≤2 serotypes following PPV23. The moderate phenotype is
based on age: for those less than 6 years old, less than 50% protective
serotypes and those age 6 years old and greater, less than 70% protective serotypes. Many patients fall in the mild phenotype, which is
less well defined as a failure of response to multiple phenotypes. The

memory phenotype, also dependent on age, is defined as an adequate
initial response and subsequent loss of protective titers within 6
months. The evaluation of specific antibodies against S. pneumoniae
polysaccharides provides guidance in determining the need for additional immunization, antibiotic therapy, or IgG replacement therapy
in SAD patients. Children and adults who have not been immunized
and have not developed protective titers in response to natural infection should be immunized with PCV followed by PPV23, as they have
been shown to respond both clinically and serologically. Patients who
fail to respond to the initial challenge with PPV23 may respond to the
conjugated vaccine, when given ≥1 year after PPV23. Most patients
have an excellent prognosis with appropriate treatment.

COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY

CVID is a syndrome characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia after
an initial period of apparent normal immune function. Serum IgG
must be <2 standard deviations below the age-­adjusted norms, with
low IgA and/or IgM levels. CVID patients may appear similar clinically
to those with XLA in the types of infections experienced and bacterial
etiologic agents involved, except that enterovirus meningoencephalitis
is rare in patients with CVID. In contrast to XLA, the sex distribution
in CVID is almost equal, the age at onset is later, and infections may be
less severe. CVID is the most common of the antibody defects.

Chapter 166 u B-Cell and Antibody Deficiencies
Genetics and Pathogenesis

CVID is a phenotypic diagnosis with a polygenic inheritance in most
cases. Genes known to produce the CVID phenotype when pathogenic
variants occur include ICOS (inducible co-­
stimulator) deficiency,
SH2DIA (responsible for X-­linked lymphoproliferative disease [XLP]),
CD19, CD20, CD21, CD81, BAFF-­R (B-­cell–activating factor of the
tumor necrosis factor family of receptors), NFKB1 and NFKB2, IKZF1,
ATP6AP1, MOGS, TACI, and TRNT1 (Fig. 166.4). With rare exceptions, management of CVID does not depend on a genetic diagnosis. In
the setting of atypical infections or autoimmunity, pursuing a genetic
diagnosis can be useful because some genetic etiologies can have a
poor prognosis and transplantation should be considered. Targeted
treatment options may also be available to treat some forms of CVID
related to LRBA or CTLA4 pathogenic variants.
Despite normal numbers of circulating B cells in many patients and
the presence of lymphoid cortical follicles, blood B cells from CVID
patients do not differentiate normally into immunoglobulin-­producing
cells. They may have a deficiency of switched memory B cells.

Clinical Manifestations

The serum immunoglobulin and antibody deficiencies in CVID are
associated with recurrent sinopulmonary infections (sinusitis, otitis,
pneumonia). Most patients present before age 20. Close monitoring for
the development of chronic lung disease is needed. Repeated pulmonary infections may produce bronchiectasis; interstitial lung disease is
common (Fig. 166.5). Sepsis and meningitis with encapsulated bacteria
occur more frequently than in the general population. Patients with
recurrent infections as their only manifestation typically have a normal
life expectancy and do well with immunoglobulin replacement. The
presence of autoimmune disease or lymphoproliferation confers a poor
prognosis, as antibody replacement does not improve these conditions.
Patients with CVID often have autoantibody formation and normal-­
sized or enlarged tonsils and lymph nodes; about 25% of patients have
splenomegaly. CVID has also been associated with a spruelike enteropathy with or without nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestine.
Other autoimmune diseases include alopecia areata, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastric atrophy, achlorhydria, and pernicious
anemia. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, intestinal lung disease,
pseudolymphoma, B-­cell lymphomas, amyloidosis, and noncaseating
sarcoid-­like granulomas of the lungs (granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung disease [GLILD]), spleen, skin, and liver also

occur. Patients should be monitored closely over time for symptoms
involving multiple tissues.

166.3 Class Switch Defects
Vivian P. Hernandez-­Trujillo and Camile Ortega
The hyper-­IgM syndrome is genetically heterogeneous and characterized by normal or elevated serum IgM levels associated with low or
absent IgG, IgA, and IgE serum levels, indicating a defect in the class
switch recombination (CSR) process. Causative pathogenic variants
have been identified in the CD40 ligand gene on the X chromosome
and three genes on autosomal chromosomes: the activation-­induced
cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, the uracil DNA glycosylase gene
(UNG), and the CD40 gene on chromosome 20. Distinctive clinical
features permit presumptive recognition of the type of pathogenic variants in these patients, thereby aiding proper choice of therapy. All such
patients should undergo molecular analysis to ascertain the affected
gene for purposes of genetic counseling, carrier detection, and decisions regarding definitive therapy.

X-­LINKED HYPER-­IgM CAUSED BY MUTATIONS IN
CD40 LIGAND GENE

X-­linked hyper-­IgM is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene that
encodes the CD40 ligand (CD154, CD40L), which is expressed on
activated T-­helper (Th) cells. Males with this syndrome have very low
serum concentrations of IgG and IgA, with a usually normal or sometimes elevated concentration of polyclonal IgM; may or may not have
small tonsils; usually have no palpable lymph nodes; and often have
profound neutropenia. This disease, unlike the autosomal recessive
forms of hyper-­IgM, affects both B and T cells.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

The B cells are normal in this condition; the defect is in the T cells.
CD40L is the ligand for CD40, which is present on B cells and monocytes. CD40L is upregulated on activated T cells. Mutations result in
an inability to signal B cells to undergo isotype switching, and thus the
B cells produce only IgM. The failure of T cells to interact with B cells
through this receptor-­ligand pair also causes a failure of upregulation
of the B-­cell and monocyte surface molecules CD80 and CD86 that

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Treatment of Antibody Deficiency

Males with the CD40 ligand defect become symptomatic during the
first or second year of life with recurrent pyogenic infections, including
otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, and tonsillitis. They have marked
susceptibility to P. jirovecii pneumonia and can be neutropenic. Lymph
node histology shows only abortive germinal center formation with
severe depletion and phenotypic abnormalities of follicular dendritic
cells. These patients have normal numbers of circulating B lymphocytes, but a decreased frequency of CD27+ memory B cells. Circulating T cells are also present in normal numbers and in vitro responses
to mitogens are normal, but there is decreased antigen-­specific T-­cell
function. In addition to opportunistic infections such as P. jirovecii
pneumonia, there is an increased incidence of extensive verruca vulgaris lesions, Cryptosporidium enteritis, subsequent liver disease, and
an increased risk of malignancy.
Because of the poor prognosis, the treatment of choice is an HLA-­
identical hematopoietic stem cell transplant at an early age. Alternative
treatment for this condition is lifelong infusions of immune globulin.
In patients with severe neutropenia, the use of granulocyte colony-­
stimulating factor has been beneficial.

In contrast to patients with the CD40L defect, B cells from these
patients are not able to switch from IgM-­secreting to IgG-­, IgA-­, or
IgE-­secreting cells, even when co-­cultured with normal T cells. The
defects are all B-­cell intrinsic. The most common autosomal recessive
defect is in a gene that encodes AID. AID deaminates cytosine into
uracil in targeted DNA, which is followed by uracil removal by UNG.
Severely impaired CSR was found in three hyper-­IgM patients reported
to have UNG deficiency. Their clinical characteristics were similar to
those with AID deficiency, with increased susceptibility to bacterial
infections and lymphoid hyperplasia. Histologic examination of the
enlarged lymph nodes reveals the presence of giant germinal centers
(5-­10 times > normal) filled with highly proliferating B cells. Autosomal recessive hyper-­IgM can be caused by defects in CD40. Clinical
manifestations included recurrent sinopulmonary infections, P. jirovecii
pneumonia, and Cryptosporidium parvum infections, very similar to
the manifestations seen in X-­linked hyper-­IgM syndrome. Patients
with INO80 deficiency may present with severe bacterial infections;

Concentrations of serum IgG, IgA, and IgE are very low in AID, UNG,
and CD40 deficiencies. In contrast to the CD40 ligand defect, however,
the serum IgM concentration in patients with AID deficiency is usually
markedly elevated and polyclonal. Patients with AID and UNG mutations have lymphoid hyperplasia, are generally older at age at onset,
do not have susceptibility to P. jirovecii pneumonia, often do have isohemagglutinins, and are much less likely to have neutropenia unless
it occurs on an autoimmune basis. The lymphoid hyperplasia distinguishes these patients from many others with antibody deficiency, particularly agammaglobulinemia, which leads to a paucity of lymphoid
tissue. They have a tendency, however, to develop autoimmune and
inflammatory disorders, including diabetes mellitus, polyarthritis,
autoimmune hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia,
Crohn disease, and chronic uveitis.
With early diagnosis and antibody replacement, as well as good management of infections with antibiotics, patients with AID and UNG
mutations generally have a more benign course than do those with the
CD40L or CD40 defects. CD40 deficiency is rare but appears to mimic
the manifestations of CD40L quite closely.
Except for the CD40 ligand defect, for which stem cell transplantation is recommended, judicious use of antibiotics to treat documented
infections and regular administration of immunoglobulin are the only
effective treatments for primary B-­cell disorders. The most common
forms of replacement therapy are either intravenous or subcutaneous
immune globulin (IVIG or SCIg). Broad antibody deficiency should
be carefully documented before such therapy is initiated. The rationale
for the use of IVIG or SCIg is to provide missing antibodies, not to
raise the serum IgG or IgG subclass level. The development of safe and
effective immunoglobulin preparations is a major advancement in the
treatment of patients with severe antibody deficiencies, although it is
expensive and there have been national shortages.
Almost all commercial preparations are isolated from normal plasma
by the Cohn alcohol fractionation method or a modification of it. Cohn
fraction II is then further treated to remove aggregated IgG. Additional
stabilizing agents such as sugars, glycine, and albumin are added to
prevent reaggregation and protect the IgG molecule during lyophilization. The ethanol used in preparation of immunoglobulin inactivates

HIV, and an organic solvent/detergent step inactivates hepatitis B and
C viruses. Some preparations are also nanofiltered to remove infectious
agents. Most commercial lots are produced from plasma pooled from
10,000 to 60,000 donors and therefore contain a broad spectrum of
antibodies. Each pool must contain adequate levels of antibody to antigens in various vaccines, such as tetanus and measles. However, there
is no standardization based on titers of antibodies to more clinically
relevant organisms, such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b.
The IVIG and SCIg preparations available in the United States have
similar efficacy and safety. Rare transmission of hepatitis C virus has
occurred in the past, but this has been resolved by the additional treatment step. There has been no documented transmission of HIV by any of
these preparations. IVIG or SCIg at a dose of 400-600 mg/kg per month
achieves trough IgG levels close to the normal range. Higher doses are
indicated in patients with chronic or severe respiratory infections. Systemic
reactions may occur, but rarely are these true anaphylactic reactions.
Neutropenia associated with B-­cell defects has responded to granulocyte
colony-­stimulating factor. Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is
essential in maintaining adequate IgG levels.

166.4 Isotype Defects
Vivian P. Hernandez-­Trujillo and Camile Ortega

SELECTIVE IgA DEFICIENCY

An isolated absence or near absence (<5 mg/dL) of serum and secretory IgA is the most common well-­defined immunodeficiency disorder, with a disease frequency as high as 0.33% in some populations.
Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop sinopulmonary or gastrointestinal (GI) infections (especially Giardia). IgA deficiency is also
associated with celiac disease and other autoimmune disorders. The
diagnosis cannot be made until about 4 years of age, when IgA levels
should be matured to adult levels.
The basic defect resulting in IgA deficiency is unknown. Phenotypically normal blood B cells are present. In these patients, normal
levels of other isotypes and normal specific antibody levels are seen.
This defect also often occurs in pedigrees containing individuals with
CVID. Indeed, IgA deficiency may evolve into CVID over time. IgA
deficiency is noted in patients treated with the same drugs associated
with producing CVID (phenytoin, d-­penicillamine, gold, and sulfasalazine), suggesting that environmental factors may trigger this disease in a genetically susceptible person.

Clinical Manifestations

Infections occur predominantly in the respiratory, GI, and urogenital
tracts. Bacterial agents responsible are the same as in other antibody
deficiency syndromes. Intestinal giardiasis is common. Serum concentrations of other immunoglobulins are usually normal in patients with
selective IgA deficiency, although IgG2 (and other) subclass deficiency
has been reported.
Serum antibodies to IgA are reported in as many as 44% of patients
with selective IgA deficiency. These antibodies can cause nonhemolytic
transfusion reactions. Washed erythrocytes (frozen blood would have

1285

this done routinely) or blood products from other IgA-­deficient individuals should be administered to patients with IgA deficiency. Many
immune globulin preparations contain sufficient IgA to cause reactions. It is important to note that administration of immune globulin, which is >99% IgG, is not indicated because most IgA-­deficient
patients make IgG antibodies normally.

IgG Subclass Deficiencies

Some patients have deficiencies of one or more of the four subclasses
of IgG despite normal or elevated total IgG serum concentration. Most
patients may be asymptomatic. Some patients with absent or very low
concentrations of IgG2 also have IgA deficiency. They may present
with bacterial infections. Other patients with IgG subclass deficiency
have gone on to develop CVID, suggesting that the presence of IgG
subclass deficiency may be a marker for more generalized immune
dysfunction. The biologic significance of the numerous moderate
deficiencies of IgG subclasses that have been reported is difficult to
assess. IgG subclass measurement is not cost-­effective in evaluating
immune function in the child with recurrent infections. The more relevant issue is a patient’s capacity to make specific antibodies to protein and polysaccharide antigens, because profound deficiencies of
antipolysaccharide antibodies have been noted even in the presence
of normal concentrations of IgG2. For this reason, immune globulin
should not be administered to patients with IgG subclass deficiency
unless they are shown to have a deficiency of antibodies to a broad
array of antigens.

Immunoglobulin Heavy-­and Light-­Chain Deletions

Some completely asymptomatic individuals have been documented
to have a total absence of IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, and/or IgA1 as a result
of gene deletions. These patients illustrate the importance of assessing
specific antibody formation before deciding to initiate immune globulin therapy in IgG subclass–deficient patients. Low or undetectable levels of IgG subclasses alone is, therefore, not an indication for antibody
replacement.

166.5 Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of
Infancy
Vivian P. Hernandez-­Trujillo and Camile Ortega
A common laboratory finding in infants, transient hypogammaglobulinemia represents developmental delay in the production of immunoglobulin. It is thought to occur in as many as 1:1,000 children. Most
infants begin to produce IgG in the first 3 months of life, and the quantity produced increases throughout infancy. For reasons incompletely
understood, a small number of infants either begin late or do not
increase their production as expected. This condition will resolve with
no intervention, but represents a source of diagnostic confusion. A key
distinction is that responses to vaccines are usually preserved in this
condition, whereas in the others, including SAD, antibody responses
will be low to absent.

Chapter 167

Natural Killer Cells
Jessica M. Palmieri*, Vibha A. Szafron*, and
Lisa Forbes Satter
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that have a critical role
in the innate immune response to pathogenic challenge and cellular stress. NK cells are capable of rapid target cell killing and can
quickly secrete large amounts of preformed granzymes and perforins in response to viral infections, especially those of the herpesvirus family. They are also crucial in tumor surveillance. NK cells are
found in the circulating blood as approximately 3–15% of lymphocytes and are also found in both primary and secondary lymphoid
tissues where they are in a constant state of surveillance for cellular
abnormalities. NK cells use a detection system composed of a wide
range of germline-­encoded cell surface receptors that contribute
to simultaneous NK activating and inhibitory signals. NK cells are
constantly receiving both activating and inhibitory signals with the
balance of signals tilted toward inactivation until NK cell recognition of a target cell occurs. With target cell recognition, the balance
between inhibitory and activating signals leans in favor of activation and NK cell killing is initiated.
NK cells are defined as innate immune lymphocytes because unlike
B and T lymphocytes, they do utilize recombination-­activating gene
(RAG) proteins required for DNA rearrangement and assemblage
of diverse antigen-­specific receptors in response to antigen exposure. However, they can develop long-­lived and highly antigen-­
specific immunologic memory responses to different antigens
through RAG-­independent adaptive immunity, which provides lifelong immune memory responses. This means that despite a lack of
receptor diversity accrued via DNA rearrangement like B cells and
T cells, NK cells do have characteristics associated with the adaptive immune system; distinguishing healthy from diseased cells,
producing robust antiviral responses, and maintaining a collection
of long-­lived cells that expand during cellular stress responses.

NK CELL MARKERS, SUBSETS, AND MATURATION

Mature NK cells are traditionally defined as non-­T, non-­B lymphocytes that can rapidly produce interferon gamma (IFN-­γ) and can
mediate cellular cytotoxicity. Like all lymphocytes, they express cluster of differentiation (CD) markers that identify their cell type and
stage of development that are also upregulated or downregulated for
cell homing purposes. However, there are no surface markers that
are unique and specific for NK cells. NK cells have been traditionally identified by using flow cytometry to exclude the cellular surface
presence of leukocyte expressing markers specific to other leukocytes,
such as CD3 and CD5 (T cells), CD19 and CD20 (B cells), and CD13
and CD14 (myelomonocytic cells). Further identification of NK cells
follows via their expression of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule­1) and/or CD16, their low-­affinity Fc gamma receptor that mediates
antibody-­dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Neither CD56
nor CD16 is specific or unique to the NK cell lineage; however, these
CD markers are functionally important and thus used to characterize
major subsets of NK cells.
NK cells develop from CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in
the bone marrow and then undergo maturation in secondary lymphoid tissues. NK cell development occurs through a series of six
functionally distinct developmental stages distinguishable by cellular expression of cell surface markers including CD34, CD117,
CD94/NKG2A (surface inhibitory receptor), NKp80 (surface

activating receptor), CD16, and CD57. Once mature, NK cells then
circulate through the peripheral blood (PB) or are found in organ
tissues such as the secondary lymphoid tissues, liver, lungs, uterus,
kidneys, or gut. For example, stage 1 cells found in the bone marrow
are marked by the presence of only CD34, and subsequent stages
occur through the upregulation and downregulation of previously
mentioned cell surface markers; whereas, stage 6 mature NK cells in
the PB express Nkp80, CD16, and CD57 (Fig. 167.1).
NK cells express CD56 at different levels of development. CD56bright
NK cells that express high levels of CD56, without expressing much
CD16, are considered stage 4b and are approximately 3–10% of circulating PB NK cells. Most PB NK cells express CD16 and low levels
of CD56 and are referred to as CD56dim NK cells. Distinguishing cells
as CD56bright and CD56dim refers to the increased fluorescent intensity for CD56+ cells seen in comparison to cells negative for CD56.
CD56bright and CD56dim cells are functionally different. CD56bright
NK cells are considered to be developmentally immature and produce
higher levels of cytokines such as IFN-­γ with less cytotoxic capacity.
They can rapidly produce large amounts of cytokines and chemokines;
however, they contain low levels of perforin and granzymes and have
low or absent CD16, making them poor mediators of direct cytotoxicity and ADCC. In contrast, CD56dim cells are developmentally more
mature, contain high levels of perforin, are cytotoxic, and recognize
antibody-­coated cells through CD16. CD56dim cells are able to produce
large amounts of cytokines but not to the degree of CD56bright cells.
The cell surface marker expression for NK cells in the PB and tissues
are phenotypically distinct due to the influence of each tissue’s unique
microenvironment. Similarly, the ratio of CD56bright and CD56dim NK
subsets in the tissues is not the same as the ratios found in the PB.
In the bone marrow, lung, spleen, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and
breast tissue, CD56dim NK cells predominate, whereas CD56bright NK
cells predominate in the mucosa-­associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs;
e.g., gastric and intestinal mucosa), liver, uterus, visceral adipose tissue,
adrenal gland, and kidney.

NK Cell Functions

NK cells have a critical role in the control of tumor growth and
metastasis and are vital for the innate immune response against
infections, particularly certain viruses. Additionally, there is increasing recognition of the importance of NK cells in immunoregulation,
coordination of immunity, and modulation of autoreactivity.
NK cell activity is a balance between inhibitory and activating
signals. NK cell surfaces contain a wide range of receptors that
affect NK cell expression. Healthy host cells express high amounts
of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules that
ligate NK cell inhibitory receptors and prevent unwanted killing of
healthy cells. Infected or malignant host cells downregulate their
MHC I expression and express ligands for NK cell activating receptors, which triggers NK cell killing of the diseased cell. The balance
of signals for NK cell inhibition by MHC I expression in healthy
cells and NK cell activation by MHC I downregulation during cellular stress allows NK cells to defend against viruses and tumors
and have protective roles in fungal, extracellular bacterial, intracellular bacterial, and parasitic infections. Many viruses have evolved
to specifically downregulate MHC I in cells they infect to prevent
the host cell from presenting antigenic peptides to virus-­specific
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Although this strategy does allow
virus-­infected cell evasion from CTLs, it makes the infected cell
more susceptible to recognition by NK cells.
The three main functions of NK cells include cytokine/chemokine
production, contact-­dependent co-­stimulation, and cytotoxicity. Additionally, NK cells are capable of interfacing with the adaptive immune
system through their IgG Fc receptor, CD16, which allows them to
engage in antibody-­dependent killing.

Cytokine/Chemokine Production

Activated NK cells secrete a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines in response to stimulation by interleukin (IL)-­12, IL-­15,
and IL-­18. IFN-­γ is one of the most potent cytokines released by

NK cells. It is crucial for the antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumor
activity of NK cells through modulating death ligand expression
of caspase, FasL, and TRAIL. NK cells are thus able to target cells
for death through expression of these death ligands. Death ligand
killing is not as rapid as lytic granule killing. Additional NK cell–
released cytokines include TNF-­α, IL-­10, IL-­5, and IL-­13. NK cells
also produce chemokines (chemotactic agents) such as MIP-­1α,
MIP-­1β, IL-­8, and RANTES. It is important to note that cytokines
and chemokines in NK cells are compartmentalized separately from
the lytic granules allowing them to be accessed separately from
their cytotoxicity function.

Contact-­Dependent Co-­Stimulation

NK cells can promote and regulate immunity through direct receptor-­
ligand interactions with other cells, or contact-­
dependent co-­
stimulation. NK cells express or can be induced to express a variety
of co-­stimulatory and inhibitory ligands including the CD40 ligand,
CD28, and PD-­1, which can then interact with other types of immune
cells to alter immune responses.

NK CELL SPONTANEOUS CYTOTOXICITY

Similar to cytotoxic T cells, NK cells secrete specialized lysosome-­
related organelles known as lytic granules. However, unlike CTLs,
the lytic granules inside NK cells are preformed and abundant while
the cell is at rest, which allows for their rapid killing response on recognition of cellular distress/disease. Lytic granule contents include
perforin (pore-­forming molecule) and pro-­apoptotic enzymes such
as granzymes. Once an NK cell recognizes an activation signal from
a distressed cell, the NK cell will polarize its lytic granules toward
the portion of the NK cell membrane in contact with the target cell
where the lytic granules will then dock. This is followed by fusion
of the secretory lysosome with the plasma membrane of the target
cells. The site of NK cell connection with the target cell is called the
lytic immunologic synapse.

Once a stable connection is formed at the lytic immunologic synapse, cellular killing by the lytic granules will be completed in less than
2 hours. Perforin will insert into the target cell membrane, which will
allow for pro-­apoptotic granzymes to travel to the target cell and initiate cellular killing.

NK CELL ANTIBODY-­DEPENDENT KILLING

NK cells are also able to kill target cells via ADCC. NK cells have
an IgG Fc receptor, CD16, expressed on their cell surfaces that
allows them to recognize IgG-­opsonized targets to promote killing
without priming via lysing of the target cell. ADCC also causes NK
cell secretion of cytokines like INF-­γ for recruitment of adaptive
immune cells.

Etiologies of NK Cell Deficiency

NK cells are lymphocytes that are critical for the immune response to
viral infections. Patients with recurrent severe and refractory cutaneous viral and herpes viral infections should be evaluated for NK cell
deficiency (NKD) with both enumeration and functional studies.
However, ultimate evaluation should be completed with immunogenetic analysis as patients with diagnosed NKD may benefit from antiviral prophylaxis and eventual HSC transplant.
NKD accounts for a small subset of primary immunodeficiencies
(PIDs) that often present as clinical and diagnostic challenges. In
general, NKD is suspected in patients who appear to have increased
susceptibility to herpesvirus infections as well as select other viral
pathogens such a human papillomavirus (HPV).
NK cells can be decreased in number or function for many reasons. More commonly, severe illness and emotional stress can cause
decreases of these cells. In addition, immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and 6-­mercaptopurine can depress NK cells. Given many
factors are known to affect the stability of NK cells, repetition of the
test is required to document true deficiency. If a patient is found
to have abnormal NK cell studies 3 times, drawn at least 1 month

1288 Part XII u Immunology
apart, inborn errors in immunity should be also considered, as
described next.
More than 50 PIDs include abnormalities in NK cells as part of their
immunophenotypes. This occurs secondary to disruption in maturation, proliferation, or survival of NK cells. Forms of severe combined
immune deficiency (SCID) including IL2RG, JAK3, and AK2 deficiency are known to present with low or absent NK cell numbers. In
addition, given the importance of lytic granule secretion to NK cytotoxicity, conditions with abnormal granule secretion, such as primary
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or abnormal cytoskeletal
function, such as Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome, also can lead to NK cell
aberrations.
NKDs are classified as classical or functional. In classical NKD,
there is a significantly decreased or absent number of CD3-­CD56+ cells,
making up less than 1% of the total peripheral lymphocytes. Alternatively, although the number of NK cells can be normal in functional
NKD, these cells are functionally impaired.

Classical NK Cell Deficiency

Classical NKDs include pathogenic variants in MCM4, MCM10,
GINS1, GATA2, RTEL1, and IRF8.

MCM4 and MCM10

MCM (mini-­chromosome maintenance complex member) 4 and 10
are a part of the MCM replisome progression complex important
for DNA replication. MCM4 is part of the Cdc45-­MCM2-­7-­GINS1
(CMG) helicase complex and MCM10 is a replication factor associated with this complex. In times of cellular stress, variant complexes have resulted in abnormal DNA breakage (Fig. 167.2). These
patients have a decreased number of NK cells, specifically CD56dim
NK cells. CD56dim NK cells are mature NK cells that express CD16
(Fc receptor) and are important for ADCC. It is possible that
CD56dim NK cells are particularly reliant on the MCM complex
for survival. Alternatively, the pathogenic variant may cause an
interruption along development before mature NK cell expansion.
Patients with biallelic pathogenic variants in MCM4 have Epstein-­
Barr virus (EBV)-­driven lymphoproliferation and viral pneumonitis. As MCM4 is widely expressed in many cells, these patients
can also have adrenal insufficiency, short stature, and development
delay.
MCM10-­deficient patients have a similar immunologic phenotype related to their NK cell abnormalities and the patients reported
were found to have severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

GINS1

Go-­Ichi-­Ni-­San complex subunit 1 (GINS1) is a protein involved
in the CMG helicase complex that is important for DNA replication. Biallelic pathogenic variants in GINS have been seen to cause
growth retardation, neutropenia, and NKD. It is important to note

that both CD56dim and CD56bright cells are affected in this disorder.
MCM4, MCM10, and GINS1 defects causing classical NKD suggests
that chromosomal maintenance is critical to NK cell development
and function.

GATA2

Pathogenic variants in GATA2 (GATA-­binding protein-­2), inherited
in an autosomal dominant manner, can cause immune aberrations
affecting many different cell lines. The pathogenic variant prevents
appropriate NK cell development with specific deficiency of immature
CD56bright NK cells causing an absence of the CD56bright population,
leaving a functionally impaired CD56dim population. These patients are
known to have refractory HPV infections, among other cutaneous viral
infections, myelodysplasias, cytopenias, and a risk of acute and chronic
myeloid leukemias.

RTEL1

Biallelic pathogenic variants in regulator of telomerase elongation
(RTEL1), a DNA helicase, cause a form of dyskeratosis congenita,
bone marrow failure, and immunodeficiency known as Hoyeraal-­
Hreidarsson syndrome. One patient reported with a history of disseminated varicella infection was found to have abnormal NK cells in
number and function.

IRF8

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor
involved in B-­cell, dendritic cell, granulocyte, monocyte, and NK
cell production. IRF8 is vital for the NK cell response to viral infections and patients have been found to have severe EBV infections.
Terminal NK cell maturation is disrupted and CD56dim cells are
decreased in patients with biallelic IRF8 pathogenic variants.

FUNCTIONAL NK CELL DEFICIENCY (FNKCD)
CD16 Deficiency

Patients with CD16 deficiency have severe infections with herpes
viral pathogens such as varicella-­zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex
virus (HSV) and EBV. One patient was reported to have EBV-­driven
Castleman disease. The deficiency is caused by a homozygous pathogenic variant in the FCGR3A gene, which encodes CD16. CD16 is
the Fc receptor on NK cells required for ADCC. As CD16 deficiency
is an FNKCD, patients have normal levels of NK cells, but abnormal
function. Although CD16’s main function is to facilitate ADCC,
patients with CD16 deficiency have been found to have abnormal
spontaneous cytotoxicity with normal antibody-­dependent cytotoxicity (Fig. 167.3). Further analysis helped uncover a new function of the CD16 protein related to spontaneous cytotoxicity, which
clarifies this unexpected finding. The variant sequence in CD16
deficiency encodes for the distal B73.1 domain of the CD16 molecule. Studies from patients with this pathogenic variant revealed
that this region is needed for co-­activation of the NK cell CD2 stimulatory receptor, which is required for spontaneous cytotoxicity.
Alternatively, immunoglobulin binding, which is integral to ADCC,
occurs at the proximal 3G8 domain of CD16, which is not affected
by the variant. For diagnostic purposes, two anti-­CD16 monoclonal
antibodies are utilized against the distal B73.1 and proximal 3G8
domains. Therefore patients with CD16 deficiency will have absent
B73.1 expression and normal 3G8 expression. These diagnostic
tests can help identify patients with CD16 deficiency in addition to
genetic analysis of FCGR3A.

E74-like ETS transcription factor 4 (ELF4) is a protein involved in
transactivation of gene promoters through DNA binding. Perforin
expression, an important component of NK cell activity, has been
shown to be dependent on ELF4-regulated promoters. Pathogenic

from CD56bright to CD56dim (cytotoxic) NK cells. A rare, hemizygous variant in ELF4, located on the X chromosome, has been
described as a novel cause of NK cell deficiency. Patients with this
variant can present with recurrent sinopulmonary and varicella zoster infections, as well as lymphoproliferative and malignant disease.
Laboratory analysis has shown decreased number and function of
NK cells, specifically with an abnormal immature NK cell CD56bright
to mature CD56dim NK cell ratio. Because these patients also can
present with decreased B cells and hypogammaglobinemia, further
work is needed to elucidate the role of ELF4 in B cell development
and function.

NK Cell Diagnostic Tests

When evaluating for possible NK cell defects, it is important to examine the total NK cell count and percentage, the distribution of NK cell
subsets, and NK cell function.

NK Cell Count and Percentage

The absolute NK cell count and NK cell percentage of total lymphocytes is often calculated using a lymphocyte subset analysis or enumeration assay. This test is performed using flow cytometry and will
identify the CD16 and CD56 markers of NK cells. The majority of
lymphocyte enumeration assays use a combined CD56/16 antibody
and cannot distinguish between CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells. Further delineation of NK cell subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright, etc.) can be
obtained with further flow cytometry for additional NK cell markers.
Evaluation of NK cell phenotypes and ratios such as the CD56 bright
to dim ratio becomes important in evaluating for NK cell defects such
as GATA2 deficiency.

FUNCTIONAL ASSAYS AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL
EVALUATION
NK Cell Cytotoxicity Assay

NK cytotoxic killing ability can be evaluated using a flow cytometry–based assay to quantify NK cell cytotoxic activity or a chromium
release (51CR) cytotoxicity assay. The 51CR is technician dependent and
requires the use of radioactive material. Many laboratories are doing
the flow cytometry-­based assay.
Individual clinical laboratories have normal ranges that are particular
to their specific assay; however, the values for this assay are dependent

2

CD

CD16

on the percentage of NK cells present in the sample. A peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample with lower numbers of NK cells may
not identify as much NK cell cytotoxicity as a sample with higher levels
of NK cells, thus it is essential to take the percentage of NK cells into
account when interpreting these assays.

CD107a Degranulation

Lysosomal-­associated membrane protein-­1 (LAMP-­1) or CD107a is
contained in NK cell lytic granules. CD107a is significantly upregulated
on the surface of NK cells following lytic granule fusion with the NK
cell membrane after activation by MHC I downregulated target cells.
CD107a is thus often used as a way to evaluate activation-­induced NK
cell degranulation. In this test, NK cells are stimulated and the upregulation of CD107a is measured using flow cytometry.
CD107a degranulation has advantages and disadvantages when
compared to the NK cell cytotoxicity assay. The main advantage is
that CD107a degranulation can be measured in individual cells and is
therefore independent of the NK cells percentage. The disadvantage is
that it does not directly measure NK cell killing ability. NK cell killing
can be impaired despite appropriate degranulation for reasons such as
abnormal lytic effector molecules. Ten to 30% of resting NK cells can
be induced to degranulate when measured by flow cytometry, and in
normal individuals CD107a degranulation reasonably correlates with
killing ability.

NK CELL DEFICIENCY TREATMENT

Primarily, treatment of NKD targets the infectious complications
that occur in these patients. Specifically, HSV infections should
be treated with antiviral therapy such as acyclovir. Long-term prophylaxis should be considered after completion of treatment. HPV
infections can be significant and recurrent, and patients should be
referred to dermatology for medical and surgical management.
Additional therapies such as immunoglobulin replacement and anti-­
mycobacterial prophylaxis can be utilized depending on the genetic
cause of NKD. The only curative therapy for classical NKDs at this time
is HSC transplantation.

The Phagocytic System
Chapter 168

Neutrophils
Thomas D. Coates
THE PHAGOCYTIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE

The phagocyte system includes both granulocytes (neutrophils,
eosinophils, and basophils) and mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and tissue macrophages). Neutrophils and mononuclear
phagocytes share primary functions, including the defining properties of large-­particle ingestion and microbial killing. Phagocytes
participate primarily in the innate immune response but also help
initiate acquired immunity.
Neutrophils provide the rapid effector arm of the innate immune
system. They circulate in the bloodstream for only about 6 hours (Table
168.1), but on encountering specific chemotactic signals, they adhere
to the vascular endothelium and transmigrate into tissues. There they
ingest and kill microbes and release chemotactic signals to recruit
more neutrophils and to attract dendritic cells and other initiators of
the acquired immune response.

HEMATOPOIESIS

The hematopoietic progenitor system can be viewed as a continuum
of functional compartments, with the most primitive compartment
composed of very rare pluripotential stem cells, which have high self-­
renewal capacity and give rise to more mature stem cells, including
cells that are committed to either lymphoid or myeloid development

(Fig. 168.1). Common lymphoid progenitor cells give rise to T-­and
B-­cell precursors and their mature progeny. Common myeloid progenitor cells eventually give rise to committed single-­lineage progenitors
of the recognizable precursors through a random process of lineage
restriction in a stepwise process (see Chapter 495). The capacity of
lineage-­specific committed progenitors to proliferate and differentiate in response to demand provides the hematopoietic system with a
remarkable range of response to changing requirements for mature
blood cell production.
The proliferation, differentiation, and survival of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells are governed by hematopoietic growth factors,
a family of glycoproteins (see Chapter 495). Along with regulating proliferation and differentiation of progenitors, these factors influence the
survival and function of mature blood cells. During granulopoiesis and
monopoiesis, multiple cytokines regulate the cells at each stage of differentiation from pluripotent stem cells to nondividing, terminally differentiated cells (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils).
As cells mature, they lose receptors for most cytokines, especially those
that influence early cell development; however, they retain receptors
for cytokines that affect their mobilization and function, such as granulocyte and macrophage colony-­stimulating factors. Mature phagocytes
also express receptors for chemokines, which help direct the cells to
sites of inflammation. Chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 and its
ligand SDF-­1 play a key role in retention of developing myeloid cells
within bone marrow.

NEUTROPHIL MATURATION AND KINETICS

The process of intramedullary granulocyte maturation involves
changes in nuclear configuration and accumulation of specific intracytoplasmic granules. The bone marrow microenvironment supports
the normal steady-­
state renewal of peripheral blood neutrophils
through the generation of growth and differentiation factors by stromal cells. Growth factors such as granulocyte colony-­stimulating
factor (G-­CSF) and granulocyte-­macrophage colony-­stimulating factor (GM-­CSF) not only stimulate cell division, but also induce the
expression of transcription factors that regulate the biosynthesis of
functional components of the neutrophil, such as granule proteins.
The transcription factor PU.1 is essential for myelopoiesis, both as
a positive regulatory element and as a suppressor of GATA1, a transcription factor that directs nonmyeloid differentiation. Other transcription factors, such as Runx1 (AML1), c-­myb, CDP, C/EBPα, C/
EBPγ, and MEF, are expressed in the myeloblast and promyelocyte,
and some of these are required for azurophil granule protein expression. As cells enter the myelocyte stage, Runx1 and myb are downregulated, whereas PU.1 and C/EBPε expression rise to initiate terminal
differentiation.
Granulocytes survive for only 6-­12 hours in the circulation; therefore daily production of 2 × 104 granulocytes/μL of blood is required
to maintain a level of circulating granulocytes of 5 × 103/μL (see
Table 168.1). The relatively small peripheral blood pool includes the
rapidly interchanging circulating and marginating pools; the latter
provides entrance into the tissue phase, where neutrophils may survive for hours or days. The circulating pool is fed and buffered by a
much larger marrow population of mature neutrophils and myeloid
precursors, representing the marrow reserve and proliferating pools,
respectively. Proliferation of myeloid cells, encompassing approximately five mitotic divisions, takes place only during the first three
stages of neutrophil development, in myeloblasts, promyelocytes,
and myelocytes. After the myelocyte stage, the cells terminally differentiate into nondividing, maturing metamyelocytes, bands, and
neutrophils.
Neutrophil maturation is associated with nuclear condensation and
lobulation and the sequential production of characteristic granule populations. A myeloblast is a relatively undifferentiated cell with a large
oval nucleus, a sizable nucleolus, and a deficiency of granules. Promyelocytes acquire peroxidase-­positive azurophilic (primary) granules,
and then myelocytes and metamyelocytes acquire specific (secondary) granules; tertiary granules and secretory vesicles develop in the
final stage of neutrophil maturation.

Fig. 168.1 Major cytokine sources and actions and transcription factor requirements for hematopoietic cells. Cells of the bone marrow microen-

vironment, such as macrophages, endothelial cells, and reticular fibroblastoid cells, produce macrophage, granulocyte-­macrophage, and granulocyte colony-­stimulating factors (M-­CSF, GM-­CSF, G-­CSF), interleukin-­6 (IL-­6), and probably stem cell factor (SCF) (cellular sources not precisely
determined) after induction with endotoxin (macrophage) or IL-­1/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (endothelial cells and fibroblasts). T cells produce IL-­3,
GM-­CSF, and IL-­5 in response to antigenic and IL-­1 stimulation. These cytokines have overlapping actions during hematopoietic differentiation, as
indicated, and for all lineages, optimal development requires a combination of early-­acting and late-­acting factors. Transcription factors important
for survival or self-­renewal of stem cells are shown in red at the top, whereas stages of hematopoiesis blocked after the depletion of indicated
transcription factors are shown in red for multipotent and committed progenitors. (From Sieff CA, Daley GQ, Zon LI. Anatomy and physiology of

NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION

Neutrophil responses are initiated as circulating neutrophils flowing through the postcapillary venules detect low levels of chemokines and other chemotactic substances released from a site of
infection. The sequence of events as the neutrophil moves from circulating in the blood to the encounter and destruction of bacteria
is carefully orchestrated by a series of biochemical events, defects

of which are associated with genetic disorders of neutrophil function (Fig. 168.2). In fact, these disorders of neutrophil function lead
to our understanding of the cell biology of phagocyte function. A
subset of circulating neutrophils loosely adheres to the endothelium
through low-­affinity receptors called selectins and rolls along the
endothelium, forming the marginated pool. Soluble effectors of
inflammation trigger subtle changes in surface adhesion molecules

tach to endothelium via selectins and roll along the vessel wall until they arrive at the site of infection. Inflammatory monokines, interleukin-­1 (IL-­1),
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activate endothelial cells to express E-­and P-­selectins. E-­and P-­selectins serve as counter-­receptors for neutrophils
sialyl Lewis X and Lewis X to cause low-­avidity neutrophil rolling. Activated endothelial cells express intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-­1, which
serves as a counter-­receptor for neutrophil β2-­integrin molecules, leading to high-­avidity leukocyte spreading and the start of transendothelial
migration at the infection site. Neutrophils invade through the vascular basement membrane with the release of proteases and reactive oxidative
intermediates, causing local destruction of surrounding tissue at sites of high concentrations of chemotactic factors, and migrate to the site of infection, where they ingest and kill the bacteria. NADPH, Nicotinamide-­adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PECAM, platelet endothelial cell adhesion

on endothelial cells at the site of infection. The rolling of neutrophils allows more intense exposure of neutrophils to activating factors such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-­1 (see Fig. 168.2).
Exposure of neutrophils to these same activating factors induces
qualitative and quantitative changes in the family of β2-­integrin
adhesion receptors (the CD11/CD18 group of surface molecules),
leading to tight adhesion between neutrophils and endothelial cells
at the site of inflammation and ultimately to transmigration of the
neutrophil into the tissue.
Once through the endothelium, the neutrophil senses the gradient of chemokines or other chemoattractants and migrates to sites
of infection. Neutrophil migration is a complex process involving
rounds of receptor engagement, signal transduction, and remodeling
of the actin microfilaments composing in part the cytoskeleton. Actin
polymerization-­depolymerization occurs in approximately 8-­second
cycles and drives cyclic extension and retraction of the actin-­rich
lamella at the front of the neutrophil. Receptors at the leading edge of
the lamella detect the gradient of attractant and follow microorganisms,

then ingest and destroy them. When the neutrophil reaches the site of
infection, it recognizes pathogens by means of Fc immunoglobulin and
complement receptors, toll-­like receptors, fibronectin receptors, and
other adhesion molecules.
The neutrophil ingests microbes that are coated by opsonins, serum
proteins such as immunoglobulin and complement component C3.
The pathogens are engulfed into a closed vacuole, the phagosome
(Fig. 168.3), where two cellular responses essential for optimal microbicidal activity occur concomitantly: degranulation and activation of
nicotinamide-­adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)–dependent
oxidase. Fusion of neutrophil granule membranes with the phagosome
membrane delivers potent antimicrobial proteins and small peptides
into the phagosome.
Assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase occur at the phagosome membrane as well (see Fig. 168.3), generating large amounts of
superoxide (O2−) from molecular oxygen, which in turn decomposes
to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen. Myeloperoxidase, a major azurophil granule component, catalyzes the reaction

oxidase components and activation. On activation of phagocytic cells,
the 3 cytosolic components (red) of the NADPH oxidase (p67phox, p47phox,
and p40phox), plus the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) protein Rac2, are translocated to the membrane of the phagocytic vacuole.
The p47phox subunit binds to the flavocytochromeb558 membrane component (blue-­green) of the NADPH oxidase (gp91phox plus p22phox). The
NADPH oxidase catalyzes the formation of superoxide by transferring
an electron from NADPH to molecular oxygen (O2), thereby forming the
superoxide free radical. The unstable superoxide anion is converted to
hydrogen peroxide, either spontaneously or by superoxide dismutase
(SOD). H2O2 can follow different metabolic pathways into more potent
reactive oxidants, such as OH• or HOCl) or degradation to H2O + O2.

of H2O2 with ubiquitously present chloride ions to create hypochlorous
acid (HOCl) in the phagosome. H2O2 and HOCl are potent microbicidal agents that break down and clear pathogens from sites of infection.
In addition, neutrophils secrete a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines that recruit more neutrophils to fight the infection, attract
monocytes and macrophages that possess both microbicidal and scavenger functions, and promote antigen presentation to help initiate the
adaptive immune response. Also, the reactive oxidants can inactivate
chemotactic factors and may serve to terminate the process of neutrophil influx, thereby attenuating the inflammatory process. Finally,
the release of reactive oxygen species, granule proteins, and cytokines
can also damage local tissues, leading to the classic signs of inflammation or to more permanent impairment of tissue integrity and function. In addition to the role of neutrophils in tissue damage, they are
now known to play a significant role in regulation of inflammation and
promoting tissue repair. Turning off inflammation and removing tissue
debris is an important role and, like seeking and destroying bacteria,
this process is highly regulated as well.

Eosinophils are nondividing, fully differentiated cells with a diameter of approximately 8 μm and a bilobed nucleus that are distinguished from other leukocytes by their morphology, constituent
products, and association with specific diseases. Their characteristic membrane-­bound specific granules stain bright pink with eosin
and are cytotoxic for the larval stages of helminthic parasites and
are also thought to contribute to much of the inflammation associated with chronic allergic diseases such as asthma (see Chapter
185). Eosinophil granule proteins including major basic protein,
eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-­
derived neurotoxin, and
eosinophil peroxidase are thought to inflict epithelial cell damage,
although recent studies indicate their role may be more nuanced and
not purely destructive. Eosinophil granule contents activate other
proinflammatory cells, including mast cells, basophils, neutrophils,
and platelets and have the capacity to generate large amounts of the
lipid mediators, which can cause vasoconstriction, smooth muscle
contraction, and mucus hypersecretion (Fig. 169.1). Eosinophils are
a source of several proinflammatory cytokines and have also been
shown to influence T-­cell recruitment and immune polarization in
inflammatory settings. Thus eosinophils have considerable potential to initiate and sustain the inflammatory response of the innate
and acquired immune systems.
Eosinophil migration from the vasculature into the extracellular tissue is mediated by the binding of leukocyte adhesion receptors (e.g.,
VLA-­4) to their ligands or counterstructures (VCAM-­1) on the postcapillary endothelium. Eosinophils are recruited to tissues in inflammatory states by a group of chemokines known as eotaxins (eotaxin
1, 2, and 3). These unique pathways account for selective accumulation of eosinophils in allergic and inflammatory disorders. Eosinophils
normally dwell primarily in tissues, especially tissues with an epithelial
interface with the environment, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and lower genitourinary tracts. The life span of eosinophils
may extend for weeks within tissues.
Interleukin (IL)-­5 selectively enhances eosinophil production,
adhesion to endothelial cells, and function. Considerable evidence
shows that IL-­5 has a pivotal role in promoting eosinophilopoiesis. It
is the predominant cytokine in allergen-­induced pulmonary late-­phase
reaction, and antibodies against IL-­5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) decrease sputum eosinophils and reduce exacerbations in a
subset of patients with asthma. Eosinophils also bear unique receptors
for several chemokines, including RANTES (regulated on activation,
normal T-­cell expressed and secreted), eotaxin, and monocyte chemotactic proteins 3 and 4. These chemokines appear to be key mediators
in the induction of tissue eosinophilia.

DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH EOSINOPHILIA

The absolute eosinophil count (AEC) is used to quantify peripheral
blood eosinophilia. Calculated as the white blood cell (WBC) count/μL
× percentage of eosinophils, it is usually <450 cells/μL and varies diurnally, with eosinophil numbers higher in the early morning and diminishing as endogenous glucocorticoid levels rise.
Many diseases with allergic, infectious, hematologic, autoimmune,
or idiopathic origins are associated with moderate (AEC 1,500-­5,000
cells/μL) or severe (AEC >5,000 cells/μL) eosinophilia in peripheral
blood (Table 169.1). These disorders may range from mild and transient to chronic and life-­threatening. Importantly, blood eosinophil
numbers do not always reflect the extent of eosinophil involvement in
tissues and degranulation products may more accurately reflect disease
activity. Because prolonged eosinophilia is associated with end-­organ

damage, especially involving the heart, patients with persistently elevated AECs should undergo a thorough evaluation to search for an
underlying cause.

Allergic Diseases

Allergy is the most common cause of eosinophilia in children in the
United States. Patients with allergic asthma typically have eosinophils in
the blood, sputum, and/or lung tissue. Hypersensitivity drug reactions
can elicit eosinophilia, and when associated with organ dysfunction (e.g.,
DRESS [drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms]), these
reactions can be serious (see Chapter 193). If a drug is suspected of triggering eosinophilia, biochemical evidence of organ dysfunction should
be sought, and if found, the drug should be discontinued. Various skin
diseases have also been associated with eosinophilia, including atopic
dermatitis/eczema, pemphigus, urticaria, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are important
emerging allergic causes of eosinophilia in tissue and, in some cases,
peripheral blood (see Chapter 383). In these conditions, eosinophils
are recruited to the esophagus, stomach, and/or intestine, where they
may cause tissue inflammation and clinical symptoms such as dysphagia, food aversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. Eosinophilic
esophagitis is the most common EGID. Treatment options include proton pump inhibitors, allergen elimination diets, topical corticosteroids,
and biologics (e.g. dupilumab). Patients with nonesophageal EGIDs
often require treatment with systemic steroids.

Infectious Diseases

Eosinophilia is often associated with invasive infection with multicellular helminthic parasites, which are the most common cause in developing countries. Table 169.1 includes examples of specific organisms.
The level of eosinophilia tends to parallel the magnitude and extent of
tissue invasion, especially by larvae such as visceral larva migrans (see
Chapter 344). Eosinophilia often does not occur in established parasitic
infections that are well contained within tissues or are solely intraluminal in the GI tract, such as Giardia lamblia and Enterobius vermicularis
infection.
In evaluating patients with unexplained eosinophilia, the dietary
history and geographic or travel history may indicate potential exposures to helminthic parasites. It is frequently necessary to examine the
stool for ova and larvae at least three times. Additionally, the diagnostic parasite stages of many of the helminthic parasites that cause

and its diverse properties. Eosinophils are bilobed
granulocytes that respond to diverse stimuli, including allergens, helminths, viral infections, allografts, and nonspecific tissue injury. Eosinophils
express the receptor for interleukin (IL)-­5, a critical
eosinophil growth and differentiation factor, as well
as the receptor for eotaxin and related chemokines
(CCR3). The secondary granules contain four primary cationic proteins designated eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophil-­derived
neurotoxin (EDN). All four proteins are cytotoxic
molecules; also, ECP and EDN are ribonucleases.
In addition to releasing their preformed cationic
proteins, eosinophils can release a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and neuromediators and
generate large amounts of leukotriene C4 (LTC4).
Last, eosinophils can be induced to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and
co-­stimulatory molecules and may be involved in
propagating immune responses by presenting antigen to T cells. PAF, platelet activating factor; VIP,
vasoactive intestinal peptide. (From Leung YM,

eosinophilia never appear in feces. Thus normal results of stool examinations do not absolutely preclude a helminthic cause of eosinophilia;
diagnostic blood tests or tissue biopsy may be needed. Toxocara causes
visceral larva migrans usually in toddlers with pica (see Chapter 344).
Most young children are asymptomatic, but some develop fever, pneumonitis, hepatomegaly, and hypergammaglobulinemia accompanied
by severe eosinophilia. Isohemagglutinins are frequently elevated, and
serology can establish the diagnosis.
Two fungal diseases may be associated with eosinophilia: aspergillosis in the form of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (see
Chapter 283) and coccidioidomycosis (see Chapter 286) following
primary infection, especially in conjunction with erythema nodosum.
HIV infection can also be associated with peripheral eosinophilia.

Hypereosinophilic Syndrome

The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a heterogeneous group
of disorders characterized by sustained overproduction of eosinophils.
The three diagnostic criteria for this disorder are (1) AEC >1,500
cells/μL persisting for 6 months or longer or at least on two occasions
or with evidence of tissue eosinophilia; (2) absence of another diagnosis to explain the eosinophilia; and (3) signs and symptoms of organ
involvement. The clinical signs and symptoms of hypereosinophilic
syndrome can be heterogeneous because of the diversity of potential
organ (pulmonary, cutaneous, neurologic, serosal, GI) involvement.
Organ-­specific signs and symptoms direct the diagnostic evaluation,
but common initial tests used to evaluate hypereosinophilia and potential end-­organ complications include a comprehensive metabolic panel,
inflammatory markers, troponin level, urinalysis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, immunoglobulin levels, vitamin B12 level, tryptase level, stool examination for ova and parasites, parasite serologies,
HIV testing, and a chest x-­ray. Eosinophilic endomyocardial disease,
one of the most serious and life-­threatening complications, can cause
heart failure from endomyocardial thrombosis and fibrosis. Screening for cardiac involvement should also include an electrocardiogram,
an echocardiogram, and in some cases a cardiac MRI. Evaluation of
the hypereosinophilic syndrome requires morphologic review of the
blood and marrow, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization,
immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, and T-­cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for hematolymphoid
neoplasm. Eosinophilic leukemia, a clonal myeloproliferative variant,
may be distinguished from idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome

and FIP1-­like-­1 (FIP1L1) genes; this disorder is treated with imatinib
mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which helps target the fusion
oncoprotein (Fig. 169.2).
Therapy is aimed at suppressing eosinophilia and is initiated with
corticosteroids. Patients with possible exposure to Strongyloides should
receive concomitant empiric treatment with ivermectin to prevent
corticosteroid-­associated hyperinfection syndrome. Imatinib mesylate
may be effective in FIP1L1-­PDGFRA–negative patients. Hydroxyurea
or interferon-­alfa may be beneficial in patients unresponsive to corticosteroids. Specific anti–IL-­5 monoclonal antibodies (mepolizumab)
target this cytokine, which has a central role in eosinophil differentiation, mobilization, and activity. With therapy, the eosinophil count
declines and corticosteroid doses may be reduced. For patients with
prominent organ involvement who fail to respond to therapy, the mortality is about 75% after 3 years.

Chapter 170

Disorders of Phagocyte
Function
Thomas D. Coates
Neutrophils are the first line of defense against microbial invasion.
They arrive at the site of inflammation during the critical 2-­4 hours
after microbial invasion to contain the infection and prevent hematogenous dissemination. Much of our knowledge about neutrophil
function derives from studies done in patients with genetic errors in
neutrophil function. These critical functions and their associated disorders are depicted in Figure 168.2. Children with phagocytic dysfunction present at a young age with recurrent infections that often involve
unusual organisms and are poorly responsive to treatment.
Primary defects of phagocytic function comprise <20% of immunodeficiencies, and there is significant overlap in the presenting signs and
symptoms between phagocytic disorders and lymphocyte and humeral
disorders. Children with phagocytic defects present with deep tissue
infection, pneumonia, adenitis, cutaneous lesions, or osteomyelitis
rather than bloodstream infections (Tables 170.1 and 170.2; Fig. 170.1).
In the past, diagnosis of these disorders relied on very specialized

biologic assays. Because the genes for most of these disorders have
been identified, the first step in diagnosis for all of these disorders is to
obtain DNA analysis through commercially available genetic panels for
immunodeficiency.
Chemotaxis, the direct migration of cells into sites of infection,
involves a complex series of events (see Chapter 168). Disorders of
adhesion or granule abnormalities can have intermediate or profound
motility defects, and the propensity to infections is related to a combination of these functional deficits. One family with recessively inherited
neutrophil actin dysfunction demonstrated that a pure severe chemotactic defect can result in fatal recurrent infection. Defective in vitro
chemotaxis of neutrophils can be detected in children with various
clinical conditions. However, unless chemotaxis is essentially absent, it
is difficult to establish whether frequent infections arise from a primary
chemotactic abnormality or occur as secondary medical complications
of the underlying disorder. Dental infection with Capnocytophaga is
associated with a clear neutrophil motility defect that resolves when
the infection is eliminated.
Motility defects present with significant skin and mucosal infections.
Tender cutaneous nodular lesions may also be present and characteristically do not contain neutrophils. In fact, the presence of a true abscess
makes the diagnosis of a significant chemotactic defect less likely.
Laboratory tests of chemotaxis are biologic assays and have high
variability except in the most experienced hands. The assays must
be done on freshly obtained blood and are affected by many factors
related to the blood sampling. It is best to assay other features of the
suspected disorder, such as surface marker expression, to establish a

LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency types 1 (LAD-­1), 2 (LAD-­2), and 3
(LAD-­3) are rare autosomal recessive disorders of leukocyte function.
LAD-­1 affects about 1 per 10 million individuals and is characterized
by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and depressed inflammatory responses despite striking blood neutrophilia (Table 170.3).

Genetics and Pathogenesis

LAD-­1 results from pathogenic variants of the gene on chromosome 21q22.3 encoding CD18, the 95-­
kDa β2-­leukocyte transmembrane integrin subunit. Normal neutrophils express four
heterodimeric adhesion molecules: LFA-­1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac-­1
(CD11b/CD18, also known as CR3 or iC3b receptor), p150,95
(CD11c/CD18), and α1β2 (CD11d/CD18). These four transmembrane adhesion molecules are composed of unique extracellular α1
encoded on chromosome 16, and they share a common β2 subunit
(CD18) that links them to the membrane and connects them to
intracellular signal transduction machinery. This group of leukocyte integrins is responsible for the tight adhesion of neutrophils to
the endothelial cell surface, egress from the circulation, and adhesion to iC3b-­coated microorganisms, which promotes phagocytosis
and particulate activation of the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Some pathogenic variants of CD11/CD18 allow a low level of assembly and activity of
integrin molecules, resulting in retention of some neutrophil integrin adhesion function and a moderate phenotype.
Because of their inability to adhere firmly to intercellular adhesion molecules 1 (ICAM-­1) and 2 (ICAM-­2) expressed on inflamed
endothelial cells (see Chapter 168), neutrophils cannot transmigrate
through the vessel wall and move to the site infection. Furthermore,
neutrophils that do arrive at inflammatory sites fail to recognize microorganisms opsonized with complement fragment iC3b, an important
stable opsonin formed by the cleavage of C3b. Therefore other neutrophil functions such as degranulation and oxidative metabolism
normally triggered by iC3b binding are also greatly compromised in
LAD-­1 neutrophils, resulting in impaired phagocytic function and
high risk for serious and recurrent bacterial infections.
Monocyte function is also impaired, with poor fibrinogen-­binding
function, an activity that is promoted by the CD11/CD18 complex. Consequently, such cells are unable to participate effectively in wound healing.

Children with LAD-­2 share the clinical features of LAD-­1 but have
normal CD11/CD18 integrins. Features unique to LAD-­2 include neurologic defects, cranial facial dysmorphism, and absence of the erythrocyte ABO blood group antigen (Bombay phenotype). LAD-­2 (also
known as congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc (CDG-­IIc) derives
from pathogenic variants in the gene encoding a specific guanosine
diphosphate (GDP)-­l-­fucose transporter of the Golgi apparatus. This
abnormality prevents the incorporation of fucose into various cell surface glycoproteins, including the carbohydrate structure sialyl Lewis X
that is critical for low-­affinity rolling adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelium. This is an important initial step necessary for subsequent integrin-­mediated activation, spreading, and transendothelial
migration. Infections in LAD-­2 are milder than that in LAD-­1.
LAD-­
3 is characterized by a Glanzmann thrombasthenia–like
bleeding disorder, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and serious skin and soft tissue infections similar to those seen in LAD-­1, and
failure of leukocytes to undergo β2-­ and β1-­integrin–mediated adhesion and migration. Pathogenic variants in KINDLIN3 affect integrin
activation.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with the severe clinical form of LAD-­1 express <0.3% of the
normal amount of the β2-­integrin molecules, whereas patients with
the moderate phenotype may express 2–7% of the normal amount.
Children with severe forms of LAD present in infancy with recurrent,
indolent bacterial infections of the skin, mouth, respiratory tract, lower
intestinal tract, and genital mucosa. Significant neutrophilic leukocytosis, often >25,0000/mm3, is a prominent feature. They may have a history of delayed separation of the umbilical cord, usually with associated
infection of the cord stump. The presence of significant omphalitis is an
important feature that distinguishes these rare patients from the 10%
of healthy infants who can have cord separation at age 3 weeks or later.
Skin infection may progress to large chronic ulcers with polymicrobial
infection, including anaerobic organisms (Fig. 170.2). The ulcers heal
slowly, need months of antibiotic treatment, and often require plastic
surgery grafting. Severe gingivitis can lead to early loss of primary and
secondary teeth (Fig. 170.3). Infected areas characteristically have very
little neutrophilic infiltration (absent pus).
The pathogens infecting patients with LAD-­1 are similar to those
affecting patients with severe neutropenia (see Chapter 171) and

include Staphylococcus aureus and enteric gram-­negative organisms
such as Escherichia coli. These patients are also susceptible to opportunistic infection by fungi such as Candida and Aspergillus. Typical
signs of inflammation, such as swelling, erythema, and warmth, may
be absent. Pus does not form, and few neutrophils are identified microscopically in biopsy specimens of infected tissues. Despite the paucity
of neutrophils within the affected tissue, the circulating neutrophil
count during infection typically exceeds 30,000/μL and can surpass
100,000/μL. During intervals between infections, the peripheral blood
neutrophil count may chronically exceed 12,000/μL. LAD-­1 genotypes
with only moderate, rather than absent, amounts of functional integrins at the surface of the neutrophil have significantly reduced severity
and frequency of infections compared with children with the severe
form, although gingival disease is still a prominent feature.

Laboratory Findings
Fig. 170.2 Skin infection of a patient with leukocyte adhesion defi-

ciency type 1. Failure to form pus, inability to demarcate the fibrotic
skin debris, and limited inflammation. Enterococcus gallinarium was
cultured from the wound. (From Rich RR. Clinical Immunology: Principles and Practice. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2013, p. 273.)

The diagnosis of LAD-­1 is established most readily by flow cytometric
measurements of surface CD11b/CD18 in stimulated and unstimulated neutrophils. Neutrophil and monocyte adherence, aggregation,
chemotaxis, and iC3b-­
mediated phagocytosis demonstrate striking abnormalities. However, these assays are not clinically available.
Delayed-­type hypersensitivity reactions are normal, and most individuals have normal specific antibody synthesis, although some patients
have impaired T-­lymphocyte–dependent antibody responses. The diagnosis of LAD-­2 is established by flow cytometric measurement of sialyl
Lewis X (CD15) on neutrophils. It is important to note that the flow
cytometric assays are not done the same as the more common lymphocyte subset analysis and require specialized approaches to detect levels
of surface expression, especially to detect milder phenotypes.

Treatment

Fig. 170.3 Oral pathology in a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD-­1). Gingivitis and severe periodontitis are hallmarks
of LAD-­1. (From Rich RR. Clinical Immunology: Principles and Practice.
4th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2013, p. 273.)

Treatment of LAD-­1 depends on the phenotype, as determined by the
level of expression of functional CD11/CD18 integrins. Early allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice
for severe LAD-­1 (and LAD-­3). One patient was successfully treated
with ustekinumab, an inhibitor of interleukins 12 and 23. Other treatment is largely supportive. Patients can be maintained on prophylactic
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and should have close surveillance for early identification of infections and initiation of empirical
treatment with broad-­spectrum antibiotics. Specific determination of the
etiologic agent by culture or biopsy is important because of the prolonged
antibiotic treatment required in the absence of neutrophil function.
Some LAD-­2 patients have responded to fucose supplementation,
which induced a rapid reduction in the circulating leukocyte count and
appearance of the sialyl Lewis X molecules, accompanied by marked
improvement in leukocyte adhesion.

Chapter 170 u Disorders of Phagocyte Function
Prognosis

The severity of infectious complications correlates with the degree
of β2-­integrin deficiency. Patients with severe deficiency may die in
infancy, and those surviving infancy have a susceptibility to severe
life-­threatening systemic infections. Patients with moderate deficiency
have infrequent life-­threatening infections and relatively long survival.

CHÉDIAK-­HIGASHI SYNDROME

Chédiak-­Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by increased susceptibility to infection
caused by defective degranulation of neutrophils, a mild bleeding
diathesis, partial oculocutaneous albinism, progressive peripheral
neuropathy, and a tendency to develop a life-­threatening form of
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (see Chapter 556.2). CHS
is caused by a fundamental defect in granule morphogenesis that
results in abnormally large granules in multiple tissues. Pigmentary dilution involving the hair, skin, and ocular fundi results from
pathologic aggregation of melanosomes. Neurologic deficits are
associated with a failure of decussation of the optic and auditory
nerves. Patients exhibit an increased susceptibility to infection that
can be explained only in part by defects in neutrophil function. The
patients have progressive neutropenia as well as abnormalities in
natural killer (NK) function, again related to granule dysfunction.

Genetics and Pathogenesis

LYST (for lysosomal traffic regulator), the gene variant in CHS, is
located at chromosome 1q2-­q44. The LYST/CHS protein is thought
to regulate vesicle transport by mediating protein-­protein interaction and protein-­membrane associations. Loss of function may
lead to indiscriminate interactions with lysosomal surface proteins,
yielding giant granules through uncontrolled fusion of lysosomes
with each other.
Almost all cells of patients with CHS show some oversized and dysmorphic lysosomes, storage granules, or related vesicular structures.
Melanosomes are oversized, and delivery to the keratinocytes and hair
follicles is compromised, resulting in hair shafts devoid of pigment
granules. This abnormality in melanosomes leads to the macroscopic
impression of hair and skin that is lighter than expected from parental
coloration. The same abnormality in melanocytes leads to the partial
ocular albinism associated with light sensitivity.
Beginning early in neutrophil development, spontaneous fusion
of giant primary granules with each other or with cytoplasmic membrane components results in huge secondary lysosomes with reduced
contents of hydrolytic enzymes, including proteinases, elastase, and
cathepsin G. This deficiency of proteolytic enzymes may be responsible
for the impaired killing of microorganisms by CHS neutrophils.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with CHS have light skin and silvery hair and frequently complain of solar sensitivity and photophobia that is associated with rotary
nystagmus. Other signs and symptoms vary considerably, but frequent
infections and neuropathy are common. The infections involve mucous
membranes, skin, and respiratory tract. Affected children are susceptible
to gram-­positive bacteria, gram-­negative bacteria, and fungi, with S.
aureus being the most common offending organism. The neuropathy
may be sensory or motor in type, and ataxia may be a prominent feature. Neuropathy often begins in the teenage years and becomes the most
prominent problem.
Patients with CHS have prolonged bleeding times with normal platelet counts, resulting from impaired platelet aggregation associated with
a deficiency of the dense granules containing adenosine diphosphate
and serotonin.
The most life-­threatening complication of CHS is the development of an accelerated phase characterized by pancytopenia, high
fever, and lymphohistiocytic infiltration of liver, spleen, and lymph
nodes. The onset of the accelerated phase, which can occur at any
age, is now recognized to be a genetic form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This occurs in 85% of patients and usually results
in death.

1301

Laboratory Findings

The diagnosis of CHS is established by finding large inclusions in all
nucleated blood cells. These can be seen on Wright-­stained blood
films and are accentuated by a peroxidase stain. Because of impaired
egress from the bone marrow, cells containing the large inclusions may
be missed on peripheral blood smear but readily identified on bone
marrow examination. The patients have progressive neutropenia and
abnormal platelet, neutrophil, and NK function.

Treatment

High-­dose ascorbic acid (200 mg/day for infants; 2,000 mg/day for
adults) may improve the clinical status of some children in the stable
phase. Although controversy surrounds the efficacy of ascorbic acid,
given the safety of the vitamin, it is reasonable to administer ascorbic
acid to all patients.
The only curative therapy to prevent the accelerated phase is HSCT.
Normal stem cells reconstitute hematopoietic and immunologic function, correct the NK cell deficiency, and prevent conversion to the
accelerated phase, but cannot correct or prevent the neuropathy. If the
patient is in the accelerated phase with active hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, HSCT often fails to prevent death. While HSCT can cure
the neutrophil defect and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, it does
nothing for neurologic complications.

MYELOPEROXIDASE DEFICIENCY

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder
of oxidative metabolism and is one of the most common inherited disorders of phagocytes, occurring at a frequency approaching 1 per 2,000
individuals. MPO is a green heme protein located in the azurophilic
lysosomes of neutrophils and monocytes and is the basis for the greenish tinge to pus accumulated at a site of infection.

Clinical Manifestations

MPO deficiency is usually clinically silent. Rarely, patients may have
disseminated candidiasis, usually in conjunction with diabetes mellitus. Acquired partial MPO deficiency can develop in acute myelogenous leukemia and in myelodysplastic syndromes.

Laboratory Findings

Deficiency of neutrophil and monocyte MPO can be identified by histochemical analysis. Severe MPO deficiency can cause the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometric assay for chronic granulomatous
disease (CGD) to be falsely positive. Unlike CGD, eosinophils in severe
MPO deficiency will still reduce DHR and yield a normal reaction.

Treatment

There is no specific therapy for MPO deficiency. Aggressive treatment
with antifungal agents should be provided for candidal infections. The
prognosis is usually excellent.

CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE

CGD is characterized by neutrophils and monocytes capable of normal
chemotaxis, ingestion, and degranulation, but unable to kill catalase-­
positive microorganisms because of a defect in the generation of
microbicidal oxygen metabolites. CGD is a rare disease, affecting 4-­5
per 1 million individuals; it is caused by four genes: one X-­linked and
three autosomal recessive inheritance (Table 170.4).

Genetics and Pathogenesis

Activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase requires stimulation of the
neutrophils and involves assembly from cytoplasmic and integral membrane subunits (see Fig. 168.3). Oxidase activation initiates with phosphorylation of a cationic cytoplasmic protein, p47phox (47-­kDa phagocyte
oxidase protein). Phosphorylated p47phox, together with two other cytoplasmic components of the oxidase, p67phox and the low-­molecular-­weight
guanosine triphosphatase Rac2, translocates to the membrane, where they
combine with the cytoplasmic domains of the transmembrane flavocytochrome b558 to form the active oxidase complex. The flavocytochrome is
a heterodimer composed of p22phox and highly glycosylated gp91phox. The

disorder as a result of pathogenic variants in CYBB, an X-­chromosome
gene encoding gp91phox. Approximately 35% of patients inherit CGD
in an autosomal recessive fashion resulting from pathogenic variants
in the NCF1 gene on chromosome 7, encoding p47phox. Defects in the
genes encoding p67phox (NCF2 on chromosome 1) and p22phox (CYBA
on chromosome 16) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner
and account for approximately 5% of cases of CGD.
The CGD phagocytic vacuoles lack microbicidal reactive oxygen
species and remain acidic, so bacteria are not killed or digested properly (Fig. 170.4). Hematoxylin-­eosin–stained sections from patients’
tissues show multiple granulomas that give CGD its descriptive name.

Clinical Manifestations

Although the clinical presentation is variable, several features suggest the
diagnosis of CGD. These include any patient with recurrent pneumonia,
lymphadenitis, hepatic, subcutaneous, or other abscesses, osteomyelitis
at multiple sites, family history of recurrent infections, or any infection
with an unusual catalase-­positive organism requires evaluation (Fig.
170.5). Other clinical features include chronic colitis or enteritis, gastric
outlet or ureteral obstruction from granulomas, or bloodstream infection caused by Salmonella, Burkholderia cepacia, or Candida.
The onset of clinical signs and symptoms usually occurs in early
infancy, although a few patients with very rare CGD subtypes have
presented later in life. The attack rate and severity of infections are
exceedingly variable; however, the infection incidence decreases in
the second decade, coincident with maturation of the lymphocyte and
humoral immunity. The most common pathogen is S. aureus, but any
catalase-­positive microorganism may be involved. Other organisms
frequently causing infections include Serratia marcescens, B. cepacia,
Aspergillus, Candida albicans, Nocardia, and Salmonella. There may
also be increased susceptibility to mycobacteria, including the bacille
Calmette-­
Guérin vaccine. Pneumonia, lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis, and skin infections are the most common illnesses encountered.
Bacteremia or fungemia occurs but is much less common than focal
infections and usually only occurs when local infections have been
inappropriately treated for long periods. Patients may have sequelae of
chronic infection, including anemia of chronic disease, poor growth,

Fig. 170.4 Pathogenesis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).

The manner in which the metabolic deficiency of the CGD neutrophil
predisposes the host to infection is shown schematically. Normal neutrophils stimulate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the phagosome containing ingested Escherichia coli. Myeloperoxidase is delivered to the
phagosome by degranulation, as indicated by the closed circles. In this
setting, H2O2 acts as a substrate for myeloperoxidase to oxidize halide
to hypochlorous acid and chloramines that kill the microbes. The quantity of H2O2 produced by the normal neutrophil is sufficient to exceed
the capacity of catalase, an H2O2-­catabolizing enzyme of many aerobic
microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, most gram-­negative
enteric bacteria, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus. When organisms
such as E. coli gain entry into CGD neutrophils, they are not exposed to
H2O2 because the neutrophils do not produce it, and the H2O2 generated by microorganisms themselves is destroyed by their own catalase.
When CGD neutrophils ingest streptococci, which lack catalase, the organisms generate enough H2O2 to result in a microbicidal effect. As indicated (middle), catalase-­positive microbes such as E. coli can survive
within the phagosome of the CGD neutrophil. (Adapted from Boxer LA.

Granuloma formation and inflammatory processes are a hallmark
of CGD and may be the presenting symptoms that prompt testing for
CGD if they cause pyloric outlet obstruction, bladder outlet or ureter obstruction, or rectal fistulas and granulomatous colitis simulating
Crohn disease. More than 80% of CGD patients have positive serology
for Crohn disease. Persistent fever, especially with splenomegaly and
cytopenia, warrants an evaluation for secondary macrophage activation syndrome. This has been seen in CGD and may require treatment
with corticosteroids and discontinuation of interferon-­γ treatment.

Laboratory Findings

The diagnosis is most often made by performing flow cytometry using
DHR to measure oxidant production through its increased fluorescence
when oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The nitroblue tetrazolium
dye test is frequently cited in the literature but is only rarely used clinically. The X-­linked carrier state is usually easily diagnosed in the mother
by DHR fluorescence through a bimodal response to stimulation. It is
important to test the mother as some extremely lyonized carriers with <5%
positive cells may have chronic clinical problems as well. Ideally, at least the
first patient in a kindred should have DNA analysis to facilitate prenatal
diagnosis and for genetic counseling purposes.
A few individuals have been described with apparent CGD caused by
severe glucose-­6-­phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to insufficient NADPH substrate for the phagocyte oxidase. The erythrocytes of
these patients also lack the enzyme, leading to chronic hemolysis.

Treatment

HSCT is the only known cure for CGD, although gene therapy has
been transiently successful in a few patients and is the topic of active
research. HSCT transplant for all patients with CGD is strongly recommended if a suitable sibling or unrelated donor can be identified. The
long-­term outcome for survival late into adulthood is not good, even in
the hands of experienced CGD physicians. Curative therapy at an early
age is strongly recommended by many experts.
Patients with CGD should be given daily oral TMP/SMX because it
reduces the number of bacterial infections. A placebo-­controlled study
found that interferon-­γ 50 μg/m2 three times per week significantly
reduces the number of hospitalizations and serious infections, although
the mechanism of action is unclear. Itraconazole (200 mg/day for patients
weighing >50 kg and 100 mg/day for patients <50 kg and ≤5 years old)
administered prophylactically reduces the frequency of fungal infections.
Management of infection is dramatically different than in normal children. CGD patients are always at risk for deep-­seated, indolent bacterial
infections that can become widespread if not treated properly. They also

1303

develop the same kinds of infections that occur in normal children, so
determination of the appropriate treatment can be difficult. The ESR can
be quite helpful. If the child does not have a deep-­seated infection, the ESR
will be normal or will normalize within several days with standard management. If it does not, however, a search for deep tissues is warranted,
as is consideration of empirical antibiotics. Cultures should be obtained,
but are usually negative. Because all neutrophil functions in CGD except
killing are normal, there is often an exuberant inflammatory reaction to a
very small number of organisms. Thus blood cultures and direct cultures
of biopsy samples are usually negative unless there are many organisms.
Most abscesses require surgical drainage for therapeutic and diagnostic
purposes. Prolonged use of antibiotics is required even for common bacterial infections. A simple pneumonia may require 6-­8 weeks or more of
parenteral antibiotics. Infections should be treated for at least 1 week past
normalization of ESR to prevent recurrence. Severe pneumonias can be
cleared completely but may require many months of parenteral antibiotics.
Especially because cultures are often not helpful, many support an “antibiotic sensitivity by sedimentation rate response” approach to treatment.
The ESRs are often 40-­80 mm/hr or more with severe infection and will
decrease monotonically over a week or so after starting antibacterial drugs.
It is important to check the ESR daily or every other day because of moderate variability in this test, and changes in treatment need to be based on
trends rather than individual values. If there is a clear downward trend
over 3-­10 days, continue with antibacterials alone. If this is not the case,
parenteral voriconazole should be added to cover Aspergillus. Failure of
the ESR to decrease suggests another antimicrobial approach needs to be
tried. This sequential addition of antimicrobials offers some insight into
the nature of the infection. If both antibacterials and antifungal are started
at the same time, one cannot know what caused a response.
Because of the rarity of this disorder, it is critical to seek counsel from
someone with significant direct experience with management of several
CGD patients. Granulocyte transfusions have been used, but their benefit is unclear. The ESR should be regularly monitored in well patients and
whenever they appear ill. A high ESR itself is usually not enough to trigger
treatment. However, in the presence of symptoms, one should search for
sources at least by contrast CT of the sinus, chest, and abdomen. If the
patient is unstable or has very high fevers, B. cepacia should be considered
and empirically covered. This organism can cause septic shock quickly,
unlike the usual smoldering infections seen in CGD. The patient can be
treated with antibiotics until the ESR is normal and radiographic evidence
of infection has been cleared, if possible. The overall incidence of infection
decreases in the second decade of life as nonneutrophil immunity matures,
but increased risk of infection is lifelong.
Corticosteroids may be useful for the treatment of children with antral
and urethral obstruction or severe granulomatous colitis. Corticosteroids
can also be helpful in pneumonia to shrink granulomas in the lung and
promote drainage. Short (4-­6 days) pulses of 1-­2 mg/kg of prednisone are
recommended, with rapid taper to avoid long-­term side effects and risk
of fungus. Pulses can be repeated if clinical effect has not been achieved.

Genetic Counseling

Identifying a patient’s specific genetic subgroup by DNA analysis
is useful primarily for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. In
X-­linked CGD, all possibly affected females should be tested by DHR
to exclude carrier state. Diagnosis by DNA is strongly recommended
in suspected carriers with normal DHR who are related to a known
proband, because rarely DHR testing is normal in obligate carriers
and may indicate that the patient has a spontaneous mutation and the
mother may not be a carrier at all. Counseling is best done by a physician who has direct knowledge of the clinical manifestations of CGD.

Prognosis

The overall mortality rate for CGD is about two patient deaths per year
per 100 cases, with the highest mortality among young children. The
development of effective infection prophylaxis regimens, close surveillance for signs of infections, and aggressive surgical and medical interventions have improved the prognosis.

Chapter 171

Leukopenia
Thomas F. Michniacki and
Kelly J. Walkovich
Leukopenia refers to an abnormally low number of white blood cells
(WBCs) in the circulating blood secondary to a paucity of lymphocytes, granulocytes, or both. Because there are marked developmental changes in normal values for WBC counts during childhood,
normal ranges must be considered in the context of age. For newborns, the mean WBC count at birth is high, followed by a rapid fall
beginning at 12 hours through the first week of life. Thereafter, values
are stable until 1 year of age, after which a slow, steady decline in the
WBC count continues throughout childhood until adult values are
reached during adolescence. Evaluation of patients with leukopenia
begins with a thorough history, physical examination, and at least one
confirmatory complete blood count with differential. Further evaluation then depends on whether the leukopenia represents a decreased
number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or both cell populations (Table
171.1). Treatment depends on the etiology and clinical manifestations of the leukopenia.

NEUTROPENIA

Neutropenia is defined as a decrease in the absolute number of circulating segmented neutrophils and bands in the peripheral blood.
The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is determined by multiplying the total WBC count by the percentage of segmented neutrophils plus bands. Normal neutrophil counts must be stratified for
age and race. Neutrophils predominate at birth but rapidly decrease
in the first few days of life. During infancy, neutrophils constitute
20–30% of circulating leukocyte populations. Near-­equal numbers
of neutrophils and lymphocytes are found in the peripheral circulation at 5 years of age, and the characteristic 70% predominance
of neutrophils that occurs in adulthood is usually attained during
puberty. For White children >12 months old, the lower limit of normal for the ANC is 1,500/μL; for Black children >12 months old, the
lower limit of normal is 1,200/μL. The relatively lower limit of normal in Black individuals likely reflects the prevalence of the Duffy
negative (Fy−/−) blood group, which is enriched in populations in
the malarial belt of Africa and is associated with ANCs 200-­600/μL
less than those who are Duffy positive.
Neutropenia may be characterized as mild (ANC 1,000-­1,500/μL),
moderate (ANC 500-­1,000/μL), or severe (ANC <500/μL). ANC
<200 is also termed agranulocytosis. This stratification aids in
predicting the risk of pyogenic infection in patients who have neutropenia resulting from disorders of bone marrow production,
because only patients with severe neutropenia have a significantly
increased susceptibility to life-­threatening infections. Neutropenia
associated with monocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, or hypogammaglobulinemia increases the risk for infection compared with
isolated neutropenia. Patients with neutropenia caused by increased
destruction (e.g., autoimmune) may tolerate very low ANCs without
increased frequency of infection, because of their often robust ability
to generate additional neutrophils from their functioning marrow
when needed.
Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and is often a result
of rapid neutrophil use and compromised neutrophil production.
Chronic neutropenia by definition lasts longer than 3 months
and arises from reduced production, increased destruction, or
excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. The etiology of

neutropenia can be classified as either an acquired disorder or
extrinsic insult (Table 171.2) or more rarely an inherited, intrinsic
defect (Table 171.3).

Clinical Manifestations of Neutropenia

Individuals with neutrophil counts <500/μL are at substantial risk
for developing infections, primarily from their endogenous flora
as well as from nosocomial organisms. However, some patients
with isolated chronic neutropenia may not experience many serious infections, probably because the remainder of the immune
system remains intact or because neutrophil delivery to tissues is
preserved, as in autoimmune neutropenias (AINs). In contrast,
children whose neutropenia is secondary to acquired disorders of
production, as occurs with cytotoxic therapy, immunosuppressive
drugs, or radiation therapy, are likely to develop serious bacterial
infections because many arms of the immune system are markedly
compromised and the ability of the marrow to robustly generate
new phagocytes is impaired. Neutropenia associated with additional monocytopenia or lymphocytopenia is more highly associated with serious infection than neutropenia alone. The integrity
of skin and mucous membranes, the vascular supply to tissues, and
nutritional status also influence the risk of infection.
The most common clinical presentation of profound neutropenia includes fever, frequent infections, aphthous stomatitis,
and gingivitis. Infections frequently associated with neutropenia
include cellulitis, furunculosis, perirectal inflammation, colitis,
sinusitis, warts, and otitis media, as well as more serious infections such as pneumonia, deep tissue abscess, and sepsis. The most
common pathogens causing infections in neutropenic patients are
Staphylococcus aureus and gram-­negative bacteria. Isolated neutropenia does not heighten a patient’s susceptibility to parasitic or
viral infections or to bacterial meningitis but does increase the risk
of fungal pathogens causing disease. The usual signs and symptoms of local infection and inflammation (e.g., exudate, fluctuance,
regional lymphadenopathy) may be diminished in the absence
of neutrophils because of the inability to form pus, but patients
with agranulocytosis still experience fever and feel pain at sites of
inflammation.

Laboratory Findings

Isolated absolute neutropenia has a limited number of causes (see
Tables 171.2 to 171.6). The duration and severity of the neutropenia
greatly influence the extent of laboratory evaluation. Patients with
chronic neutropenia since infancy and a history of recurrent fevers
and chronic gingivitis should have WBC counts and differential
counts determined 3 times a week for 6-­8 weeks to evaluate for periodicity suggestive of cyclic neutropenia. Bone marrow aspiration
and biopsy should be performed on select patients to assess cellularity and myeloid maturation. Additional marrow studies, such as
cytogenetic analysis and flow cytometry for detecting leukemia and
other malignant disorders, should be obtained for patients with suspected intrinsic defects in the myeloid progenitors and for patients
with suspected malignancy. Children of African or Arabic descent
with mild to moderate neutropenia should have Duffy null, Fy(a-b-)
variant, screening completed. Selection of further laboratory tests is
determined by the duration and severity of the neutropenia and the
associated findings on physical examination (see Table 171.1).

Acquired Neutropenia
Infection-­Related Neutropenia

Transient neutropenia often accompanies or follows viral infections and is the most frequent cause of neutropenia in childhood
(Table 171.4). Viruses causing acute neutropenia include influenzas A and B, SARS-CoV-2, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
enteroviruses, human herpesvirus 6, measles, rubella, and varicella.
Parvovirus B19 and hepatitis A or B may also cause neutropenia,

but are more often associated with pure red cell aplasia or multiple
cytopenias, respectively. Viral-­associated acute neutropenia often
occurs during the first 24-­48 hours of illness and usually persists
for 3-­8 days, which generally corresponds to the period of viremia.
The neutropenia is related to virus-­induced redistribution of neutrophils from the circulating to the marginating pool. In addition,
neutrophil sequestration may occur after virus-­induced tissue damage or splenomegaly.

Significant neutropenia also may be associated with severe bacterial,
protozoal, rickettsial, or fungal infections (see Table 171.4). Bacterial
sepsis is a particularly serious cause of neutropenia, especially among
younger infants and children. Premature neonates are especially prone
to exhausting their marrow reserve and rapidly succumbing to bacterial sepsis.

Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, or HIV and certain immunodeficiencies

such as X-­linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), hyper-­IgM syndrome
and AIDS. The neutropenia associated with AIDS likely arises from
a combination of viral bone marrow suppression, antibody-­mediated
destruction of neutrophils, and effects of antiretroviral or other
drugs.

Drug-­Induced Neutropenia

Drugs constitute a common cause of neutropenia (Table 171.5). The
incidence of drug-­induced neutropenia increases dramatically with
age; only 10% of cases occur among children and young adults. The
majority of cases occur among adults >65 years, likely reflecting the
more frequent use of multiple medications in that age-­group. Almost
any drug can cause neutropenia. The most common offending drug
classes are antimicrobial agents, antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics,
antiepileptics, antipyretics, and antirheumatics. Drug-­induced neutropenia has several underlying mechanisms (immune-­
mediated,
toxic, idiosyncratic, hypersensitivity, idiopathic) that are distinct from
the severe neutropenia that predictably occurs after administration of
antineoplastic drugs or radiotherapy.
Drug-­induced neutropenia from immune mechanisms usually
develops abruptly, is accompanied by fever, and lasts for about 1
week after the discontinuation of the drug. The process likely arises
from effects of drugs such as propylthiouracil or penicillin that act
as haptens to stimulate antibody formation, or drugs such as quinine that induce immune complex formation. Other drugs, including the antipsychotic drugs such as the phenothiazines, can cause
neutropenia when given in toxic amounts, but some individuals,
such as those with preexisting neutropenia, may be susceptible to
levels at the high end of the usual therapeutic range. Late-­onset neutropenia can occur after rituximab therapy. Idiosyncratic reactions,

dose or duration of use. Hypersensitivity reactions are rare and may
involve arene oxide metabolites of aromatic anticonvulsants. Fever,
rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, and
aplastic anemia are often associated with hypersensitivity-­induced
neutropenia. Acute hypersensitivity reactions such as those caused
by phenytoin or phenobarbital may last for only a few days if the
offending drug is discontinued. Chronic hypersensitivity may last
for months to years.
Once neutropenia occurs, the most effective therapeutic measure
is withdrawal of nonessential drugs, particularly drugs most commonly associated with neutropenia. Usually, the neutropenia will
resolve soon after withdrawal of the offending drug. If the neutropenia fails to improve with drug withdrawal and the patient is symptomatic with infection or stomatitis, subcutaneous administration
of recombinant human granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor (G-­
CSF; filgrastim, 5 μg/kg/day) should be considered. Drug-­induced
neutropenia may be asymptomatic and noted only as an incidental
finding or because of regular monitoring of WBC counts during
drug therapy. For patients who are asymptomatic, continuation of
the suspected offending drug depends on the relative risks of neutropenia vs discontinuation of a possibly essential drug. If the drug
is continued, blood counts should be monitored for possible progression to agranulocytosis.
Neutropenia usually and predictably follows the use of anticancer
drugs or radiation therapy, especially radiation directed at the pelvis or vertebrae, secondary to cytotoxic effects on rapidly replicating
myeloid precursors. A decline in the WBC count typically occurs 7-­10
days after administration of the anticancer drug and may persist for
1-­2 weeks. The neutropenia accompanying malignancy or following
cancer chemotherapy is frequently associated with compromised cellular immunity and barrier compromise secondary to central venous
lines and mucositis, thereby predisposing patients to a much greater
risk of infection than found in disorders associated with isolated
neutropenia. Patients with chemotherapy/radiation-­related neutropenia and fever must be treated aggressively with broad-­spectrum
antibiotics.

Nutrition-­Related Neutropenia

Poor nutrition can contribute to neutropenia. Ineffective myelopoiesis may result in neutropenia caused by acquired dietary copper,
vitamin B12, or folic acid deficiency. In addition, megaloblastic
pancytopenia also can result from extended use of antibiotics such
as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole that inhibit folic acid metabolism and from the use of phenytoin, which may impair folate absorption in the small intestine, or from surgical resection of the small
intestine. Neutropenia also occurs with starvation and marasmus
in infants, with anorexia nervosa, and occasionally among patients
receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition without vitamin supplementation. Patients receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition and
supplemental lipids are additionally at risk for neutropenia given
hepatosplenomegaly-­related sequestration and marrow infiltration

by abnormal macrophages filled with blue-­staining pigment granules and atypical lipid vacuoles; these cells are termed sea-­blue
histiocytes.

Immune-­Mediated Neutropenia

Immune-­mediated neutropenia is usually associated with the presence
of circulating antineutrophil antibodies, which may mediate neutrophil destruction by complement-­mediated lysis or splenic phagocytosis
of opsonized neutrophils, or by accelerated apoptosis of mature neutrophils or myeloid precursors.
Alloimmune neonatal neutropenia occurs after transplacental
transfer of maternal alloantibodies directed against antigens on the
infant’s neutrophils, analogous to Rh-­hemolytic disease. Prenatal sensitization induces maternal IgG antibodies to neutrophil antigens on
fetal cells. The neutropenia is often severe and infants may present
within the first 2 weeks of life with skin or umbilical infections, fever,
and pneumonia caused by the usual microbes that cause neonatal disease. By 7 weeks of age, the neutrophil count usually returns to normal,
reflecting the decay of maternal antibodies in the infant’s circulation.
Treatment consists of supportive care and appropriate antibiotics for
clinical infections, plus G-­CSF for severe infections without neutrophil
recovery.
Mothers with autoimmune disease may give birth to infants who
develop transient neutropenia, known as neonatal passive AIN. The
duration of the neutropenia depends on the time required for the
infant to clear the maternally transferred circulating IgG antibody. It
persists in most cases for a few weeks to a few months. Neonates almost
always remain asymptomatic.
AIN of infancy is a benign condition with an annual incidence
of approximately 1 per 100,000 among children between infancy
and 10 years of age. Antineutrophil antibodies are inappropriately
created by the child during an inflammatory episode, most commonly a mild viral infection. Patients usually have severe neutropenia on presentation, with ANC <500/μL, but the total WBC
count is generally within normal limits. Monocytosis or eosinophilia may occur but does not impact the low rate of infection.
The median age of presentation is 8-­11 months, with a range of
2-­54 months. The diagnosis is often evident when a blood count
incidentally reveals neutropenia in a child with a minor infection
or when a routine complete blood count is obtained at the 12-­
month well-­child visit. Occasionally, children may present with
more severe infections, including abscesses, pneumonia, or sepsis.
The diagnosis may be supported by the presence of antineutrophil
antibodies in serum; however, the test has frequent false-­negative
and false-­p ositive results, so the absence of detectable antineutrophil antibodies does not exclude the diagnosis, and a positive
result does not exclude other conditions. Therefore the diagnosis
is best made clinically based on a benign course and, if obtained,
a normal or hyperplastic myeloid maturation in the bone marrow. There is considerable overlap between AIN of infancy and
“chronic benign neutropenia.”

1308 Part XII u Immunology
Treatment is not generally necessary because the disease is only
rarely associated with severe infection and usually remits spontaneously. Low-­dose G-­CSF may be useful for severe infections, to promote wound healing following surgery, or to avert emergency room
visits or hospitalizations for febrile illnesses. Longitudinal studies of
infants with AIN demonstrate median duration of disease ranging
from 7-­30 months. Affected children generally have no evidence or
risk of other autoimmune diseases.
AIN in older children can occur as an isolated process, as a manifestation of other autoimmune diseases, or as a secondary complication
of infection, drugs, or malignancy. In primary AIN, low circulating
neutrophil counts are the only hematologic finding, and associated
diseases or other factors that cause neutropenia are absent. Secondary
AIN associated with immune dysregulation or other factors is more
often identified in older children and is less likely to remit spontaneously. AIN is distinguished from other forms of neutropenia by the
demonstration of antineutrophil antibodies (with caveats previously
discussed) and myeloid hyperplasia on bone marrow examination. The
most common antineutrophil antibody targets are human neutrophil
antigens 1a, 1b, and 2.
Treatment of AIN relies on management of any underlying disorders. In addition, judicious use of appropriate antibiotics for
bacterial infections is generally beneficial, as is family and primary
care provider education. Regular dental hygiene, always strongly
recommended, is even more important. Infections tend to be less
frequent in AIN than with the corresponding degree of neutropenia
from other causes, probably because tissue delivery of neutrophils
is greater than that in conditions resulting from impaired production. Prophylactic antibiotics may be helpful for the management
of recurrent minor infections. For patients with serious or recurrent infections, G-­CSF is generally effective at raising the ANC and
preventing infection. Very low doses (<1-­2 μg/kg/day) are usually
effective, and administration of standard doses can lead to severe
bone pain from marrow expansion.

Neutropenia Secondary to Bone Marrow
­Replacement

Various acquired bone marrow disorders lead to neutropenia, usually accompanied by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Hematologic
malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and metastatic solid
tumors, suppress myelopoiesis by infiltrating the bone marrow
with tumor cells. Neutropenia may also accompany aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic disorders, or preleukemic syndromes, which
are characterized by multiple cytopenias and often macrocytosis.
Treatment requires management of the underlying disease.

Neutropenia Secondary to Reticuloendothelial
­Sequestration

Splenic enlargement resulting from intrinsic splenic disease (storage disease), portal hypertension, or systemic causes of splenic
hyperplasia (inflammation or neoplasia) can lead to neutropenia.
Most often the neutropenia is mild to moderate and is accompanied
by corresponding degrees of thrombocytopenia and anemia. The
reduced neutrophil survival corresponds to the size of the spleen,
and the extent of the neutropenia is inversely proportional to bone
marrow compensatory mechanisms. Usually, the neutropenia can be
corrected by successfully treating the underlying disease. In select
cases, splenectomy may be necessary to restore the neutrophil count
to normal, but results in increased risk of infections by encapsulated bacterial organisms. Patients undergoing splenectomy should
receive appropriate preoperative immunizations and may benefit
from antibiotic prophylaxis after splenectomy to help mitigate the
risk of sepsis. Splenectomy should be avoided in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease, and other immunodeficiency syndromes because
of the higher risk of sepsis.

Inherited Neutropenia

Intrinsic disorders of proliferation or maturation of myeloid precursor
cells are rare. Table 171.6 presents a classification based on genetics
(Fig. 171.1) and molecular mechanisms; other organ involvement or
physical features may suggest an etiology (Table 171.7).

Primary Disorders of Granulopoiesis

Cyclic neutropenia is an autosomal dominant congenital granulopoietic disorder occurring with an estimated incidence of 0.5-­1 cases per
1 million population. The disorder is characterized by regular, periodic
oscillations, with the ANC ranging from normal to <200/μL, mirrored
by reciprocal cycling of monocytes. Cyclic neutropenia is sometimes
termed cyclic hematopoiesis because of the secondary cycling of other
blood cells, such as platelets and reticulocytes. The mean oscillatory
period of the cycle is 21 days (±4 days). During the neutropenic nadir,
many patients develop malaise, fever, oral and genital ulcers, gingivitis,
periodontitis, or pharyngitis, and occasionally lymph node enlargement. More serious infections occasionally occur, including pneumonia, mastoiditis, and intestinal perforation with peritonitis leading
to life-­threatening clostridial sepsis. Before the availability of G-­CSF,
approximately 10% of patients developed fatal clostridial or gram-­
negative infections. Cyclic neutropenia arises from a regulatory abnormality involving early hematopoietic precursor cells and is almost
invariably associated with pathologic variants in the neutrophil elastase
gene, ELANE, that lead to accelerated apoptosis as a result of abnormal protein folding. Many patients experience abatement of symptoms
with age. The cycles tend to become less noticeable in older patients,
and the hematologic picture often begins to resemble that of chronic
idiopathic neutropenia.
Cyclic neutropenia is diagnosed by obtaining blood counts 3 times
a week for 6-­8 weeks. The requirement for repeated blood counts is
necessary because some of the elastase variants overlap with those
in patients who have severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Demonstrating oscillation or a lack thereof in the blood counts helps to
identify patients’ risks for progression to myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a risk that is only associated with SCN. The diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic studies
demonstrating a pathologic variant in ELANE. Affected patients with
neutrophil nadirs <200/μL are treated with G-­CSF, and their cycle of
profound neutropenia changes from a 21-­day period with at least 3-­5
days of profound neutropenia to 9-­11 days with 1 day of less profound
neutropenia. The dose needed to maintain nadirs >500/μL is usually
2-­4 μg/kg/day administered daily or every other day.
SCN is a rare, genetically heterogeneous, congenital granulopoietic
disorder with an estimated incidence of 1-­2 cases per 1 million population. The disorder is characterized by an arrest in myeloid maturation
at the promyelocyte stage in the bone marrow, resulting in ANCs consistently <200/μL and may occur sporadically, with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. The dominant form is caused most often
by pathologic variants in ELANE, which accounts for 60–80% of SCN
cases, whereas recessive forms arise from variants in HAX1 (the form
also known as Kostmann disease) or G6PC3 (encoding a myeloid-­
specific isoform of glucose-­
6-­
phosphatase). Pathologic alterations
in GFI1, CSF3R, and JAGN1 additionally may lead to the condition.
HAX1 variants may be associated with neurologic deficits, and G6PC3
with heart defects, urogenital abnormalities, and venous angiectasia.
In addition to severe neutropenia, peripheral blood counts generally
show monocytosis and many also exhibit eosinophilia; chronic inflammation may lead to secondary anemia and thrombocytosis. Patients
who have SCN experience frequent episodes of fever, skin infections
(including omphalitis), oral ulcers, gingivitis, pneumonia, and perirectal abscesses, typically appearing in the first few months of life. Infections often disseminate to the blood, meninges, and peritoneum and
are usually caused by S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas species. Without filgrastim therapy, most patients die of infectious complications within the first 1-­2 years of life despite prophylactic antibiotics.

More than 95% of SCN patients respond to filgrastim (G-­CSF)
treatment with an increase in the ANC and a decrease in infections. Doses required to achieve an ANC >1,000/μL vary greatly. A
starting dose of filgrastim at 5 μg/kg/day is recommended; the dose
should be gradually increased, if necessary, to as high as 100 μg/kg/
day to attain an ANC of 1,000-­2,000/μL. The 5% of patients who do
not respond to filgrastim or who require high doses (>8 μg/kg/day)
should be considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT). Along with infections, patients with SCN are at risk for
developing MDS associated with monosomy 7 and AML. For this
reason, regular monitoring with blood counts and yearly bone marrow surveillance, including karyotyping and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, should be performed on all SCN patients. Although
clonal cytogenetic abnormalities may spontaneously remit, their
appearance should be considered a strong indication for HSCT,
which is much more likely to be successful before progression to
MDS/AML.

Disorders of Molecular Processing

Shwachman-­Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive
disorder classically characterized by neutropenia, pancreatic insufficiency, and short stature with skeletal abnormalities. SDS is most
commonly caused by pro-­apoptotic pathologic variants of the SBDS
gene, which encodes a protein that plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. The initial symptoms are usually steatorrhea and failure to thrive because of malabsorption secondary
to pancreatic insufficiency, which usually develops by 4 months of
age, although the gastrointestinal symptoms may be subtle in some
patients and go unrecognized. Patients have also been reported to
have respiratory problems with frequent otitis media, pneumonia,
and eczema. Virtually all patients with SDS have neutropenia, with
the ANC periodically <1,000/μL. Some children have hypogammaglobulinemia, defects in chemotaxis, or a reduction in the number
or function of B, T, and natural killer (NK) cells that may contribute to the increased susceptibility to pyogenic infection. The diagnosis of SDS is based on clinical phenotype; approximately 90% of
patients have pathologic variants identified in SBDS with additional
disease-­
causing variants now recently discovered in DNAJC21,
EFL1, and SRP54. SDS may progress to bone marrow hypoplasia
or MDS/AML; identification of increasing TP53 variants or cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly isochromosome i(7q) and del(20q),
often precede conversion to MDS, so routine bone marrow monitoring is warranted. Treatment includes pancreatic enzyme replacement, plus G-­CSF in patients with severe neutropenia.
Telomere biology disorders (TBDs), including dyskeratosis
congenita, are disorders of telomere length that most often present

as bone marrow failure rather than isolated neutropenia. Various
pathologic variants have now been identified to cause such conditions (see Table 171.6), including alterations in ACD, PARN, DKC1,
RTEL1, TERC, and TERT. Moreover, the classic phenotype includes
nail dystrophy, leukoplakia, malformed teeth, and reticulated
hyperpigmentation of the skin, although many patients, particularly
young ones, do not exhibit these clinical features. Pulmonary and
hepatic fibrosis is also a concern in individuals with TBDs. Patients
are at risk for not only hematologic dysplasia/malignancy but additionally neoplasms involving the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and
head and neck. Early and routine screening for these malignancies
can be lifesaving.

Vesicular Trafficking Disorders

This group of rare primary immunodeficiency syndromes (see Table
171.6) derives from autosomal recessive defects in the biogenesis or
trafficking of lysosomes and related endosomal organelles. The syndromes share phenotypic characteristics, including defects in melanosomes contributing to partial albinism, abnormal platelet function, and
immunologic defects involving not only neutrophil number, but also
the function of neutrophils, B lymphocytes, NK cells, and cytotoxic T
lymphocytes. The syndromes share a high risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) as a result of defects in T and NK cells.
Chédiak-­Higashi syndrome has characteristic giant cytoplasmic
granules in neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and is a disorder of subcellular vesicular dysfunction caused by pathologic variants
in the LYST gene, with resultant giant granules in all granule-­bearing
cells. Patients have increased susceptibility to infections, mild bleeding diathesis, progressive peripheral neuropathy, and predisposition to
life-­threatening HLH. The only curative treatment is HSCT, but transplant does not treat all aspects of the disorder.
Griscelli syndrome type II also features neutropenia, partial albinism, and a high risk of HLH, but peripheral blood granulocytes do
not show giant granules. Patients often have hypogammaglobulinemia.
The disorder is caused by alterations in RAB27a, which encodes a small
guanosine triphosphatase that regulates granule secretory pathways.
The only curative treatment is HSCT.

Disorders of Metabolism

Recurrent infections with neutropenia are a distinctive feature of glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ib. As in classic von Gierke disease
(GSDIa), glycogen storage in GSDIb causes massive hepatomegaly and
severe growth retardation. Pathologic variants in glucose-­6-­phosphate
transporter 1, G6PT1, inhibit glucose transport in GSDIb, resulting in
both defective neutrophil motility and increased apoptosis associated
with neutropenia and recurrent bacterial infections. Treatment with

childhood. Chronic benign neutropenia may be sporadic or inherited
in either dominant or recessive form. Because of the relatively low risk
of serious infection, patients usually do not require any therapy.
Idiopathic chronic neutropenia is characterized by the onset of
neutropenia after 2 years of age, with no identifiable etiology. Patients
with an ANC persistently <500/μL may have recurrent pyogenic infections involving the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and lymph nodes.
Bone marrow examination reveals variable patterns of myeloid formation with arrest generally occurring between the myelocyte and band
forms. The diagnosis overlaps with chronic benign and AINs.

Treatment

The management of acquired transient neutropenia associated with
malignancies, myelosuppressive chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive chemotherapy differs from that of congenital or chronic forms of
neutropenia. In the former situation, infections sometimes are heralded only by fever, and sepsis is a major cause of death. Early recognition and treatment of infections may be lifesaving. Therapy of severe
chronic neutropenia is dictated by the clinical manifestations. Patients
with benign neutropenia and no evidence of repeated bacterial infections or chronic gingivitis require no specific therapy. Superficial infections in children with mild to moderate neutropenia may be treated
with appropriate oral antibiotics. In patients who have invasive or life-­
threatening infections, broad-­spectrum intravenous antibiotics should
be started promptly.
Subcutaneously administered G-­CSF can provide effective treatment
of severe chronic neutropenia, including SCN, cyclic neutropenia, and
chronic symptomatic idiopathic neutropenias. Treatment leads to dramatic increases in neutrophil counts, resulting in marked attenuation of
infection and inflammation. Doses range from 2-­5 μg/kg/day for cyclic,
idiopathic, and AINs, to 5-­100 μg/kg/day for SCN. The long-­term effects
of G-­CSF therapy include a propensity for the development of moderate
splenomegaly, reduced bone density, thrombocytopenia, and rarely vasculitis; only patients with SCN are at risk for MDS/AML.

Patients with SCN or SDS who develop MDS or AML respond only
to HSCT; chemotherapy is ineffective. HSCT is also the treatment of
choice for aplastic anemia or familial HLH.

LYMPHOPENIA

The definition of lymphopenia, as with neutropenia, is age dependent
and can have acquired or inherited causes. The absolute lymphocyte
count (ALC) is determined by multiplying the total WBC count by the
percentage of total lymphocytes. For children <12 months old, lymphopenia is defined as an ALC <3,000 cells/μL. For older children and
adults, an ALC <1,000 cells/μL is considered lymphopenia. In isolation, mild to moderate lymphopenia is generally a benign condition
often detected only in the evaluation of other illnesses. However, severe
lymphopenia can result in serious, life-­threatening illness. Lymphocyte
subpopulations can be measured by flow cytometry, which uses the
pattern of lymphocyte antigen expression to quantitate and classify T,
B, and NK cells.

Acquired Lymphopenia

Acute lymphopenia is most often a result of infection and/or is iatrogenic from lymphocyte-­toxic medications and treatments (Table
171.8). Microbial causes include viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial
virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza, measles, hepatitis, COVID-­19), bacterial infections (e.g., tuberculosis, typhoid fever, histoplasmosis, brucellosis), and malaria. The mechanisms behind infection-­associated
lymphopenia are not fully elucidated but probably include lymphocyte
redistribution and accelerated apoptosis. Corticosteroids are a common cause of medication-­induced lymphopenia, as are lymphocyte-­
specific immunosuppressive agents (e.g., antilymphocyte globulin,
alemtuzumab, rituximab), chemotherapy drugs, and radiation. In
most cases, infectious and iatrogenic causes of acute lymphopenia
are reversible, although full lymphocyte recovery from chemotherapy
and lymphocyte-­specific immunosuppressive agents may take several
months to years. Prolonged lymphopenia (see Table 171.8) may be
caused by recurrent infection, persistent infections (mostly notably
HIV), malnutrition, mechanical loss of lymphocytes through protein-­
losing enteropathy or thoracic duct leaks, or systemic diseases such as
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, renal failure,
lymphoma, and aplastic anemia.

Inherited Lymphopenia

Primary immunodeficiencies and bone marrow failure syndromes
are the main cause of inherited lymphopenia in children (see Table
171.8). Primary immunodeficiency may result in a severe quantitative
defect, as in XLA and SCID, or a qualitative or progressive defect, as
in Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome and CVID. XLA is characterized by a
near-­absence of mature B cells because of a pathologic alteration in
BTK that results in a dysfunctional tyrosine kinase. SCIDs are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormalities
of thymopoiesis and T-­cell maturation. Newborn screening for severe

Chapter 172 u Leukocytosis 1313

Chapter 172

Leukocytosis
Thomas F. Michniacki and
Kelly J. Walkovich
Leukocytosis is an elevation in the total leukocyte or white blood cell
(WBC) count that is 2 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean for
age. It is most often caused by elevated numbers of neutrophils (i.e.,
neutrophilia), although marked increases in monocytes, eosinophils,
basophils, and lymphocytes can be seen. Before extensive evaluation, it
is important to assess for spurious elevations in the WBC count caused
by platelet clumping (secondary to insufficient sample anticoagulation
or the presence of EDTA-­dependent agglutinins), high numbers of circulating nucleated red blood cells (RBCs), and the presence of cryoglobulins by review of the peripheral smear.
Malignancy, namely leukemia and lymphoma, is a primary concern
for patients with leukocytosis. For discussion of WBC elevation caused
by immature leukocytes in acute and chronic leukemias, see Chapter
544. Nonmalignant WBC counts exceeding 50,000/μL have historically been termed a leukemoid reaction. Unlike leukemia, leukemoid
reactions show relatively small proportions of immature myeloid cells,
consisting largely of band forms, occasional metamyelocytes, and progressively rarer myelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts. Leukemoid
reactions are most often neutrophilic and are frequently associated
with severe bacterial infections, including shigellosis, salmonellosis,
and meningococcemia; physiologic stressors; and certain medications.
The presence of a left shift, defined as having >5% immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood, is consistent with marrow stress.
Higher degrees of left shift with more immature neutrophil precursors
are indicative of serious bacterial infections and may be a dire sign of
depletion of the bone marrow reserve pool of neutrophils. Marked left
shift may occasionally be encountered with trauma, burns, surgery,
acute hemolysis, or hemorrhage.

NEUTROPHILIA

Neutrophilia is an increase in the total number of blood neutrophils
that is 2 SD above the mean count for age. Elevated absolute neutrophil counts represent disturbances of the normal equilibrium involving bone marrow neutrophil production, migration out of the marrow
compartments into the circulation, and neutrophil destruction. Neutrophilia may arise either alone or in combination with enhanced
mobilization into the circulating pool from either the bone marrow
storage compartment or the peripheral blood marginating pool, by
impaired neutrophil egress into tissues, or by expansion of the circulating neutrophil pool secondary to increased granulopoiesis. Myelocytes
are not released to the blood except under extreme circumstances.

Acute Acquired Neutrophilia

Neutrophilia is usually an acquired, secondary finding associated
with inflammation, infection, injury, or an acute physical or emotional stressor (Table 172.1). Bacterial infections, trauma (especially
with hemorrhage), and surgery are among the most common causes
encountered in clinical practice. Neutrophilia may also be associated
with heat stroke, burns, diabetic ketoacidosis, vaccines, pregnancy, or
cigarette use.
Drugs commonly associated with neutrophilia include epinephrine,
corticosteroids, and recombinant growth factors such as recombinant
human granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor (G-­CSF) and recombinant human granulocyte-­
macrophage colony-­
stimulating factor
(GM-­CSF). Epinephrine causes release into the circulation of a sequestered pool of neutrophils that normally marginate along the vascular
endothelium. Corticosteroids accelerate the release of neutrophils and
bands from a large storage pool within the bone marrow and impair

the migration of neutrophils from the circulation into tissues. G-­CSF
and GM-­CSF cause acute and chronic neutrophilia by mobilizing cells
from the marrow reserves and stimulating neutrophil production.
Acute neutrophilia in response to inflammation and infections
occurs because of release of neutrophils from the marrow storage pool.
The postmitotic marrow neutrophil pools are approximately 10 times
the size of the blood neutrophil pool, and about half of these cells are
bands and segmented neutrophils. Exposure of blood to foreign substances such as hemodialysis membrane activates the complement
system and causes transient neutropenia, followed by neutrophilia secondary to release of bone marrow neutrophils. Reactive neutrophils
often have toxic granulation and Döhle bodies present.

Chronic Acquired Neutrophilia

Chronic acquired neutrophilia is usually associated with continued
stimulation of neutrophil production resulting from persistent inflammatory reactions or chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis), vasculitis,
postsplenectomy states, Hodgkin disease, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic blood loss, sickle cell disease, some chronic hemolytic
anemias, and prolonged administration of corticosteroids (see Table
172.1). Chronic neutrophilia can arise after expansion of cell production secondary to stimulation of cell divisions within the mitotic
precursor pool, which consists of promyelocytes and myelocytes. Subsequently, the size of the postmitotic pool increases. These changes
lead to an increase in the marrow reserve pool, which can be readily
mobilized for release of neutrophils into the circulation. The neutrophil production rate can increase greatly in response to exogenously
administered hematopoietic growth factors, such as G-­CSF, with a
maximum response taking at least 1 week to develop.

Lifelong Neutrophilia

Congenital or acquired asplenia is associated with lifelong neutrophilia. Some patients with trisomy 21 also have neutrophilia. Uncommon genetic disorders that present with neutrophilia include leukocyte
function disorders such as leukocyte adhesion deficiency and Rac2
deficiency (see Chapter 170) and systemic disorders such as familial
cold urticaria, periodic fever syndromes, and familial myeloproliferative disease (see Table 172.1). Rare patients with an autosomal dominant hereditary neutrophilia have been reported.
Evaluation of persistent neutrophilia requires a careful history,
physical examination, and laboratory studies to search for infectious,
inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. The leukocyte alkaline
phosphatase score of circulating neutrophils can differentiate chronic
myelogenous leukemia, in which the level is uniformly almost zero,
from reactive or secondary neutrophilia, which features normal to
elevated levels.

ADDITIONAL FORMS OF LEUKOCYTOSIS
Monocytosis

The average absolute blood monocyte count varies with age, which
must be considered in the assessment of monocytosis. Given the role of
monocytes in antigen presentation and cytokine secretion and as effectors of ingestion of invading organisms, it is not surprising that many
clinical disorders give rise to monocytosis (Table 172.2). Typically,
monocytosis occurs in patients recovering from myelosuppressive chemotherapy and is a harbinger of the return of the neutrophil count to
normal. Monocytosis is occasionally a sign of an acute bacterial, viral,
protozoal, or rickettsial infection and may also occur in some forms of
chronic neutropenia and postsplenectomy states. Chronic inflammatory conditions can stimulate sustained monocytosis, as can preleukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and lymphomas.

Eosinophilia

Eosinophilia is defined as an absolute eosinophil count >1500 cells/μL.
The majority of eosinophilic conditions are reactive, including infections (especially parasitic diseases), connective tissue disorders, allergic
and hyperinflammatory diseases, pulmonary disorders, and dermatologic conditions (see Chapter 169). Drug reaction with eosinophilia
and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a particularly important condition

686.2). Hypereosinophilic syndrome and systemic mastocytosis are
additional important causes of an elevated eosinophil count. However,
persistent eosinophilia can also herald a malignancy such as leukemia,
lymphoma, or carcinoma.

Basophilia

Basophilia is defined as an absolute basophil count >120 cells/μL. Basophilia is a nonspecific sign of a wide variety of disorders and is usually
of limited diagnostic importance. Basophilia is most often present in
hypersensitivity reactions and frequently accompanies the leukocytosis
of chronic myeloid leukemia.

Lymphocytosis

The most common cause of lymphocytosis is an acute viral illness, as
part of the normal T-­cell response to the infection. In infectious mononucleosis, the B cells are infected with the Epstein-­Barr virus, and the T
cells react to the viral antigens present in the B cells, resulting in atypical
lymphocytes with characteristic large, vacuolated morphology. Other
viral infections classically associated with lymphocytosis are cytomegalovirus and viral hepatitis. Chronic bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and brucellosis may lead to a sustained lymphocytosis. Pertussis is
accompanied by marked lymphocytosis in approximately 25% of infants
infected before 6 months of age. Thyrotoxicosis and Addison disease are
endocrine disorders associated with lymphocytosis. Persistent or pronounced lymphocytosis suggests acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Chapter 173

Complement System
Anete Sevciovic Grumach
173.1 Complement Components, Pathways,
and Evaluation
Anete Sevciovic Grumach
The complement system (CS) forms a network of soluble and cell surface–bound components, pattern-­recognition proteins (PRPs), proteases, receptors, effectors, and regulators to perform multiple sensor
and effector functions as part of the innate immune system (Tables
173.1 and 173.2). It represents an essential part of immunity, having a
major role in host defense against pathogens, homeostasis, and inflammation, such as promoting phagocytic removal of senescent cells,
molecular debris, and weak or superfluous synapses during brain formation. Complement acts not only in the extracellular space but also
within cells and subcellular compartments, where it is involved in the
regulation of basic processes of the cell, suggesting that complement
directs both innate and adaptive immune responses. Cells are generally
protected from amplification and effector insult by a group of complement regulators, which are expressed on their surface or mobilized
from the circulation. However, if the equilibrium between complement
activation and regulation is disturbed, complement can harm the host
and precipitate or worsen adverse processes that result in diseases.
Circulating complement proteases are zymogens and, once activated, they initiate an amplification cascade through cleavage of specific targets and/or interaction with other proteins. Depending on the
activating surface, the CS can be triggered by the classical (CP), lectin (LP), and alternative (AP) pathways. Each pathway is triggered
by different interactions. The CP is initiated by immune complexes
through binding of complement protein C1q to immune complexes
containing IgM or IgG, in solution or bound to antigens on the cell
surface. Certain bacteria, RNA viruses, and the lipid A component
of bacterial endotoxin as pathogen-­associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) on microbial surfaces can activate C1q directly and trigger
the full complement cascade. The LP is activated when mannose-­
binding lectin (MBL), or ficolins, recognize unique carbohydrate

structures present on the surface of pathogens or altered glycosylation
patterns (DAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns) on abnormal
host cells. The mannose-­binding lectin-­associated serine proteases
(MASPs) cleave C2 and C4, following the same sequence as CP.
The AP is rapidly activated after contact with pathogens, independent
of antibody; however, antibody will accelerate the rate of activation. The
fluid phase C3 convertase complex C3(H2O)Bb is generated with the
spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, referred to as “tick over.” An amplification loop leads to rapid opsonization stabilized by properdin. Therefore
each of these pathways converge toward the cleavage of the abundant
plasma protein C3 by a C3 convertase, followed by the formation of a
C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b, and induces the activation of the common lytic effector terminal pathway (TP). The interaction among C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 is nonenzymatic and depends
on changes in molecular configuration. The subsequent insertion of TP
components into the cell wall leads to lysis via the membrane attack
complex (MAC), which is composed of complement proteins C5b to C9.
Cell membrane receptors bind complement components or fragments
to mediate complement activity, and a large array of serum and membrane regulatory proteins control the activation of CS (Fig. 173.1). The
circulating components and regulators together comprise approximately
15% of the globulin fraction and 4% of the total serum proteins. The
normal concentrations of serum complement components vary by age;
newborn infants have mild to moderate deficiencies of all components.

CLASSICAL AND LECTIN PATHWAYS

The CP sequence begins with fixation of C1, by way of C1q, to the Fc non–
antigen-­binding part of the antibody molecule after antigen-­antibody
interaction. On binding, the C1 complex changes conformation, activating the C1r and C1s protease subunits; the C1s subcomponent becomes
an active enzyme, C1 esterase. The activation leads to cleavage of C2 and
C4 and the formation of the CP C3 convertase (C4bC2a).
As part of the innate immune response, broadly reactive “natural” antibodies and C-­reactive protein (CRP), which react with carbohydrates from microorganisms and with dying cells, can substitute
for specific antibodies in the fixation of C1q and initiate reaction of
the entire sequence. Endogenous substances, including uric acid
crystals, amyloid deposits, DNA, and components of damaged cells,
such as apoptotic blebs and mitochondrial membranes, can activate
C1q directly. In this case, however, the ligand-­C1q complex interacts
strongly with the inhibitor’s C4-­binding protein and factor H, allowing
some C3-­mediated opsonization and phagocytosis but limiting the
full inflammatory response typically triggered by microbes.

C1q synthesized in the brain and retina fixes to superfluous synapses, which then can be cleared through C1q receptors on microglia,
clearing the way for fresh synapses to populate the developing nervous
system.
Recognition molecules in the LP are MBL, ficolins, or collectins
(CL-­11 or kidney collectin or CL-­K1; CL-­10, collectin liver 1). MBL is
the prototype of the collectin family of carbohydrate-­binding proteins
(lectins) that play an important part in innate, nonspecific immunity;
its structure is homologous to that of C1q. Three ficolins have been
identified in humans: L-­ficolin (ficolin-­2), H-­ficolin (ficolin-­3), and
M-­ficolin (ficolin-­1). Ficolins show specificity for N-­acetylglucosamine
residues in complex oligosaccharides, but not for mannose or high-­
mannose-­
type oligosaccharides. Individual members display additional specificities, e.g., H-­ficolin binds to N-­acetyl-­d-­galactosamine
and d-­fucose, M-­ficolin binds to sialic acid, and L-­ficolin recognizes
lipoteichoic acid and 1,3-­β-­d-­glucan, the major component of yeast
and fungal cell walls. These lectins, in association with MASP-­1, -­2,
and -­3, can bind to mannose, lipoteichoic acid, and other carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. There,
MASPs then function like C1s to cleave C4 and C2 and activate the
complement cascade. The peptide C4a has weak anaphylatoxin activity and reacts with mast cells to release the chemical mediators of
immediate hypersensitivity, including histamine. The activation of C3
and C5 also liberates potent chemotactic fragments (i.e., the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a) that recruit immune cells to the site of activation
and prime them. Fixation of C4b to the complex permits it to adhere
to neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells, and erythrocytes.
MASP-­2 can activate clotting by generating thrombin from prothrombin, which could prevent microbial spread.
Cleavage of C3 and generation of C3b is the next step in the sequence.
The serum concentration of C3 is the highest of any component, and its
activation is the most crucial step in terms of biologic activity. Cleavage
of C3 can be achieved through the C3 convertase of the CP, C142, or
of the AP, C3bBb. Once C3b is fixed to a complex or dead or dying host
cell, it can bind to cells with receptors for C3b (complement receptor
1, CR1), including B lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and phagocytic cells
(neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages). Efficient phagocytosis
of most microorganisms, especially by neutrophils, requires binding
of C3 to the microbe. The severe pyogenic infections that frequently
occur in C3-­deficient patients illustrate this point. The biologic activity

of C3b is controlled by cleavage by factor I to iC3b, which promotes
phagocytosis on binding to the iC3b receptor (CR3) on phagocytes.
Further degradation of iC3b by factor I and proteases yields C3dg, then
C3d; C3d binds to CR2 on B lymphocytes, thereby serving as a co-­
stimulator of antigen-­induced B-­cell activation.

ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY

The AP can be activated by C3b generated through CP activity or
proteases from neutrophils or the clotting system. It can also be activated by a form of C3 created by a low-­grade, spontaneous reaction of
native C3 with a molecule of water, or a tick over that occurs constantly
in plasma. Once formed, C3b or the hydrolyzed C3 can bind to any
nearby cell or to factor B. Factor B attached to C3b in the plasma or
on a surface can be cleaved to Bb by the circulating protease factor D.
The complex C3bBb becomes an efficient C3 convertase, which generates more C3b through an amplification loop. Properdin can bind to
C3bBb, increasing stability of the enzyme and protecting it from inactivation by factors I and H, which modulate the loop and the pathway.
Certain activating surfaces promote AP activation if C3b is fixed to
them, including bacterial teichoic acid and endotoxin, virally infected
cells, antigen–immunoglobulin A complexes, and cardiopulmonary
bypass and renal dialysis membranes. These surfaces act by protecting
the C3bBb enzyme from the control otherwise exercised by factors I
and H. Rabbit red blood cell (RBC) membrane is such a surface, which
serves as the basis for an assay of serum AP activity. Conversely, sialic
acid on the surface of microorganisms or cells prevents the formation
of an effective AP C3 convertase by promoting the activity of factors I
and H. Significant activation of C3 can occur through the AP, and the
resultant biologic activities are qualitatively the same as those achieved
through activation by C142.

MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX

The sequence leading to cytolysis begins with the attachment of C5b
to the C5-­activating enzyme from the CP, C4b2a3b, or from the AP,
C3bBb3b. C6 is bound to C5b without being cleaved, stabilizing the
activated C5b fragment. The C5b6 complex then dissociates from C423
and reacts with C7. C5b67 complexes must attach promptly to the
membrane of the parent or a bystander cell, or they lose their activity.
Next, C8 binds, and the C5b678 complex then promotes the addition of
multiple C9 molecules. The C9 polymer of at least 3-­6 molecules forms
a transmembrane channel, and lysis ensues.

CONTROL MECHANISMS

Without control mechanisms acting at multiple points, there would be
unbridled consumption of components, which would generate severe,
potentially lethal host damage. Cells are generally protected from amplification and effector insult by a panel of complement regulators, which
are expressed on their surface or recruited from circulation At the first
step, C1 inhibitor (C1-­INH) inhibits C1r and C1s enzymatic activity
and thus the cleavage of C4 and C2. C1-­INH also inhibits MASP-­2, factors XIa and XIIa of the clotting system, and kallikrein of the contact
system. Activated C2 has a short half-­life, and this relative instability
limits the effective life of C42 and C423. The AP enzyme that activates
C3, C3bBb, also has a short half-­life, although it can be prolonged by the
binding of properdin to the enzyme complex. Properdin can also bind
directly to microbes and promote assembly of the AP C3 convertase.
The serum contains the enzyme carboxypeptidase N, which cleaves
the N-­
terminus arginine from C4a, C3a, and C5a, thereby limiting their biologic activity. Factor I inactivates C4b and C3b; factor
H accelerates inactivation of C3b by factor I; and an analogous factor, C4-­binding protein (C4-­bp), accelerates C4b cleavage by factor
I, thus limiting assembly of the C3 convertase. Three protein constituents of cell membranes (CR1, membrane cofactor protein [MCP],
and decay-­accelerating factor [DAF]) promote the disruption of C3
and C5 convertases assembled on those membranes. Another cell
membrane–associated protein, CD59, can bind C8 or both C8 and
C9, thereby interfering with the insertion of the MAC (C5b6789). The
serum proteins vitronectin and clusterin can inhibit attachment of the
C5b67 complex to cell membranes, bind C8 or C9 in a full MAC, or

interfere with the formation or insertion of this complex. Vitronectin
also promotes macrophage uptake of dying neutrophils. The genes for
the regulatory proteins factor H, C4-­bp, MCP, DAF, CR1, and CR2 are
clustered on chromosome 1.

PARTICIPATION IN HOST DEFENSE

Neutralization of virus by antibody can be enhanced with C1 and C4
and further enhanced by the additional fixation of C3b through the
classical or alternative pathway. Complement may therefore be particularly important in the early phases of a viral infection when the
antibody titer is limited. Antibody and the full complement sequence
can also eliminate infectivity of at least some viruses by the production
of typical complement “holes,” as seen by electron microscopy. Fixation
of C1q can opsonize (promote phagocytosis) through binding to the
phagocyte C1q receptor.
C4a, C3a, and C5a can bind to mast cells and thereby trigger the
release of histamine and other mediators, leading to vasodilation and
the swelling and redness of inflammation. C5a can enhance macrophage
phagocytosis of C3b-­opsonized particles and induce macrophages to
release the cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-­1. C5a is
a major chemotactic factor for neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils, which can efficiently phagocytize microorganisms opsonized
with C3b or cleaved C3b (iC3b). Further inactivation of cell-­bound
C3b by cleavage to C3d and C3dg removes its opsonizing activity, but it
can still bind to B cells. Fixation of C3b to a target cell can enhance its
lysis by natural killer cells or macrophages (Fig. 173.2).
Insoluble immune complexes can be solubilized if they bind C3b,
apparently because C3b disrupts the orderly antigen-­antibody lattice.
Binding C3b to a complex also allows it to adhere to C3 receptors
(CR1) on RBCs, which then transport the complexes to hepatic and
splenic macrophages for removal. This phenomenon may at least partially explain the immune complex disease found in patients who lack
C1, C4, C2, or C3.
The CS serves to link the innate and adaptive immune systems.
C4b or C3b coupled to immune complexes promotes their binding to
antigen-­presenting macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. The coupling of antigens to C3d allows binding to CR2 on B cells, which greatly
reduces the amount of antigen needed to trigger an antibody response.

components of complement, at least through C6. Activation of the
entire complement sequence can result in lysis of virus-­infected cells,
tumor cells, and most types of microorganisms. Bactericidal activity of complement has not appeared to be important to host defense,
except for the occurrence of Neisseria infections in patients lacking
later-­acting components of complement.

Complement Evaluation

Good quality blood sampling requires that after clotting (about 20-­120
minutes), the serum must be separated by centrifugation as soon as
possible, and stored under controlled conditions. In case complement
testing cannot be performed on the day of blood sampling, the serum
and plasma samples must be stored in a deep freezer (−20°C) for up to
3 months or in an ultra-­deep freezer (−70°C) for a longer storage until
analysis. If the analysis will be done by a specialized laboratory, the
samples must be shipped on dry ice by courier. Repeated freezing and
thawing should be avoided because of the risk of in vitro activation.
The serum is sufficient for the analysis of the total function of complement proteins and regulators as well as of autoantibodies. A quantitation of activation products requires the use of EDTA plasma because
it blocks the in vitro activation of the CS by way of its Mg2+ and Ca2+
complexing properties. Heparin and citrate are less useful. The utilization of the less invasive dried blood spot (DBS)-­based assays can also
be used for diagnosis; enzyme activities could be retained, facilitating
the samples’ transportation.
The indication for using assays for complement evaluation is to
detect genetic, acquired, or the effect of complement inhibitory therapy. Functional assays can screen and direct the following steps for the
evaluation of specific protein deficiencies (Fig. 173.3). Assays including
hemolysis of RBCs (CH50, AP50) check the activation of classical and
alternative pathways. In both cases, CH50 and AP50, the functional
result is the lytic destruction of erythrocytes on membrane insertion of
C5b-­9 (MAC). Low but not absent CH50 results could reflect complement consumption due to active immune complex disease, diminished
hepatic production due to liver disease, and immaturity of hepatic
production seen in young infants. Screening with hemolytic assays is

patients with these defects, the hemolytic assay value may be minimally

activation through CP, LP, and AP (“CS screen” test). Although the
result target of these enzyme-­linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
is principally the same as for the lytic assays, it is based on detecting
full assembly of C5b-­9 by using an antibody to a C9 neoantigen when
serum is added to microtiter wells coated with the activation agent for
the different pathways (e.g., IgM for CP, mannan for LP, and lipopolysaccharides for AP).
Once an abnormal CH50 or AP50 has been confirmed, immunochemical tests can be used to define the serum levels of specific
components, the second step for defining complement deficiencies.
Normal concentrations of single components do not exclude functional defects. The functional activity of a single component can be
tested. Sera depleted of the actual component and patient’s fresh serum
are mixed to see whether the activity can be restored by using hemolysis as a result. Reduced functional activity of individual complement
components either reflects a deficiency state, or indicates consuming
complement activation. To distinguish primary or acquired defects,
activation products generated by CS activation could be measured.
Different approaches can be applied for this aim: detection of split
fragments, generated after enzymatic cleavage of certain components,
e.g., C4 (C4a, C4b/c, C4d), C3 (C3a, C3b/c, iC3b, C3d), factor B (Ba,
Bb), and C5 (C5a), or the identification of protein complexes where
activated components are bound to their respective regulators, like
C1rs-­C1-­inhibitor, the properdin-­containing AP convertase, C3bBbP,
and sC5b-­9 (soluble terminal complement complex). Detection of
complement activation products like C3d and C4d on red cells using
flow cytometry has been used to evaluate in vivo complement activation
in autoimmune diseases and trauma. The terminal C5b-­9 complement
complex exists in two forms, the MAC and the soluble form (sC5b-­
9). The in vitro–generated surface-­bound C5b-­9 must not be confused
with sC5b-­9, which is found in plasma and if increased is a useful
marker of complement activation in vivo reflecting diseases with disturbed complement function. sC5b-­9 can be quantified by ELISA and
is based on the same C9 neoepitope principle. In the case of efficient C5
blockade, there should ideally be no sC5b-­9 present.
C4 levels have been used as a screening test for C1-­INH deficiency
in hereditary angioedema (HAE); this test does not substitute quantitative and/or functional evaluation of C1-­INH. C4 concentrations can
be within normal range between episodes in approximately 5–10% of
the patients. Also, a defective C1-­INH protein can reflect only a functional assay with normal quantitative values. Deficiency of factor I or
H permits persistence of the classical and alternative pathway convertase and thus consumption of C3, with reduction in the CH50 value. If
multiple components are decreased, it is possible that sample handling
was improper, a regulatory protein was deficient, or autoantibodies
were present. Flow cytometry is the standard technique for the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) by detecting
reduced levels of CD55 and CD59 on blood cells.
Autoantibodies to complement components could simulate deficiencies and assays for their detection would be relevant according
to clinical information. They are often associated with specific diseases, e.g., anti-­C1q antibody is associated with hypocomplementemic

173.2 Complement Pathway Deficiencies
Anete Sevciovic Grumach
Most genetically determined complement deficiencies are inherited in
an autosomal recessive fashion. Exceptions are properdin deficiency,
which is X-­linked, and C1-­INH deficiency, which is autosomal dominant. In most cases, it is possible to predict the effects of a particular
deficiency based on understanding the normal physiologic function of
that protein. Increased susceptibility to infections caused by encapsulated bacteria and autoimmunity are the most common presentations of complement deficiencies. Deficiency of components of TP and
properdin deficiency are associated with neisserial infections. When
there is an imbalance between complement activation and regulation,
complement can quickly attack the host and trigger and/or exacerbate
adverse processes that result in diseases and clinical complications.
Genetic variants in the complement factor H (CFH) and complement
factor I (CFI) genes have been associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and aging macular degeneration (AMD). A
distinct clinical manifestation is described for deficiency of C1-­INH
causing recurrent angioedema.

CLASSICAL PATHWAY DEFICIENCIES

Patients deficient in the initial components of the CP are prone to autoimmune connective tissue diseases (Table 173.4). Most patients with primary C1q deficiency have SLE; some have SLE-­like syndrome without
typical SLE serology, a chronic rash with underlying vasculitis, or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The association with
SLE is due to compromised clearance of apoptotic debris and impaired
B-­cell tolerance. Some C1q-­deficient children have serious infections,
including septicemia and meningitis. Only a few patients with inherited
deficiencies of C1r and C1s have been described. It is thought that neither component is stable without the other so that a pathogenic variant
in one often leads to diminished levels of both. Glomerulonephritis and
lupus have been reported in C1r/C1s-­deficient patients.

Complement component C4 is a central protein in the classical and
lectin pathways within the CS. C4A and C4B genes encode the two
isoforms of the component C4, an essential element for the effector
arm of the humoral immune response. The two isotypes of C4, which
differ by only four amino acids, demonstrate differential chemical
reactivities: C4A displays a higher affinity for amino group–containing antigens or immune complexes, and C4B for hydroxyl group-­
containing antigens. The presence of one C4A or C4B gene is called
heterozygous C4A or C4B deficiency, whereas the presence of no
functional C4A or C4B genes causes complete C4A or C4B deficiency
and is called homozygous C4 deficiency. Homozygous deficiencies
of complement C4A or C4B are detected in 1–10% of populations.
Homozygous deficiency of C4A is associated with an increased frequency of SLE; whereas homozygous C4B deficiency has been associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial and enveloped viral
infections. Within each C4 gene, there can be deletions or duplications or simple inactivating variants; therefore interpretation of a
serum level is difficult.
C2 deficiency is found with a frequency of 1/10,000 in the White
population. The lowest frequency of autoimmunity (10–42%), among
the proteins of the CP, is observed in C2-­deficient patients. Individuals with C2 deficiency also carry the risk of life-­threatening septicemic
illnesses, usually caused by pneumococci; however, most have not had
problems, presumably because of protective effects of other complement pathways. The genes for C2, factor B (AP), and C4 are situated
close to each other on chromosome 6, and a partial depression of factor
B levels can occur in conjunction with C2 deficiency.
Patients with C1, C2, or C4 deficiency have an increased occurrence of autoantibodies; antinuclear antibodies are present in 75%
of patients with C1 or C4 deficiency and 25–55% of patients with C2
deficiency. Anti-­dsDNA antibodies are present in 20% of patients with
C1q/C4 deficiency and 33% of patients with C2 deficiency. Individuals with heterozygous C2 or C4 deficiency often remain asymptomatic.
Also, there is an increased incidence of bacterial infections associated
with deficiency of components in CP, including meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, or septicemia. Other infections such as epiglottitis, and
peritonitis have been described. The most common organisms identified in C2-­deficient patients have been Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Haemophilus influenzae type b.

C3 Deficiency

C3 deficiency is rare and the disease manifests early in life. Severe infections (pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, or bacteremia) caused by
encapsulated bacteria (H. influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis) occur. The
infections reflect the impairment in the C3b opsonization, generation
of chemotactic factor, influence in B-­cell stimulation, and failure of
complete complement activation. MPGN is noted in approximately
30% of the cases of C3 deficiency. Slightly more common is a partial
deficiency of C3, termed hypomorphic C3. This partial deficiency has
been seen in some autoimmune disorders. Rare C3 gain-­of-­function
(GOF) variants may lead to aHUS and endothelial damage in the glomerulus. One common and several rare variants in C3 have been associated with increased risk of AMD. A unique feature of C3 deficiency is a
vasculitic rash that may appear during infections; symptoms of serum
sickness may occasionally be seen. These unusual findings are due to
the lack of immune complex solubilization by C3. They typically are
transient in nature but can cause confusion with lupus, particularly in
the presence of glomerulonephritis.

DEFICIENCY OF TERMINAL COMPONENTS (C5, C6,
C7, C8, C9)

Terminal components are shared by the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways, and are ultimately responsible for the formation of the
MAC. The risk of developing meningococcal sepsis or meningitis is
markedly increased in people who have a deficiency of one terminal
component. In contrast to the immunocompetent population (median
age for meningococcal infection: 3 years), the onset of symptoms in
patients with terminal deficiencies is 17 years. However, infections
generally lead to lower mortality, may be recurrent, and have a milder
course than in an immunocompetent person. Rarely, SLE or other
autoimmune disorders has been identified in these defects. Disseminated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections have also been described; an
increased frequency of other bacterial infections is not observed. A
terminal component deficiency should be suspected if there is a family
history of meningococcal infections, repeated neisserial infections, or
if the causative meningococcal serotype is W-­135, X, Y, or Z, which
less frequently cause infections in healthy individuals. Early vaccination of children could change the profile of serotypes causing infection
in those patients.

1320 Part XII u Immunology
C6 deficiency occurs more frequently in African Americans and in
people from South Africa. Two variations of C6 deficiency have been
described. In one case, a splice defect leads to a smaller than usual protein, C6SD. This protein functions less efficiently than wild-­type C6;
however, it is not clear whether bearing C6SD leads to compromised
host defense. The other variation is combined C6 and C7 deficiency. C7
deficiency is rare and in the few reported cases, the clinical presentations have varied.
C8 is composed of three chains: α, β, and γ. C8β deficiency is more
common in White people, whereas C8α-­γ deficiency is more common
among African Americans. Approximately 1 patient in 1000 carries
a homozygous common nonsense variant causing C9 deficiency as
described in Japan and Korea. It is more difficult to diagnose than most
of the other complement deficiencies because the CH50 is diminished
but not absent. Lytic activity can be generated in the absence of C9. The
neisserial disease can occur, although the penetrance appears to be less
than that with other terminal component deficiencies.

ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY DEFICIENCIES

The AP is a highly conserved surveillance system that is continuously
turning over (tick over) due to a labile thioester bond in C3 and thus
does not require antibodies or lectins for activation. Properdin is a
positive regulator of AP activity and works by stabilizing AP convertases. Properdin deficiency is rare, hereditary, and is the only X-­linked
complement deficiency. A small number of patients have been identified with properdin deficiency; these patients are unusually susceptible to Neisseria infections. There is a particularly high fatality rate
for meningococcal disease in properdin-­deficient patients, in contrast
with the protection from early death seen in patients with terminal
complement component deficiencies. It manifests with either complete
absence of the molecule (type I), partial deficiency (type II), or a normal level of dysfunctional protein (type III). Properdin-­deficient individuals are susceptible to meningococcal disease, which is frequently
complicated by sepsis and most commonly occurs in adolescence.
Factor D and Factor B deficiencies were described in few cases and
the association with Neisseria infections was also identified. Systemic
streptococcal infections have also been involved in factor D deficiency.
GOF pathogenic variants in factor B are associated with the aHUS.

LECTIN PATHWAY DEFICIENCIES

The LP is focused on the recognition of repetitive carbohydrate patterns found on the surface of microbial pathogens. Lectin pattern
recognition molecules (PRMs), which include MBL, ficolin-­1, ficolin-­2, ficolin-­3, collectin-­10, and collectin-­11, activate the pathway in
an analogous manner to antibodies in the CP. MASPs, which act in a
similar fashion to C1r and C1s, associate with MBL and activate C4 and
C2 by proteolytic cleavage (see Fig.173.1). Among White populations,
approximately 5–7% of people have inherited MBL deficiency. LP
impairment due to insufficient production of any of these components
is common and may be associated with no clear clinical phenotype.
However, MBL insufficiency is, in combination with other factors,
associated with more severe forms of sepsis and fatal outcomes. The
deficiency appears to represent a modest risk factor for infection, typically revealed in a high-­risk setting. Similarly, it may subtly alter the
course or contribute to the overall risk of developing several autoimmune diseases. MBL deficiency has been associated as an additional
severity influence for common variable immunodeficiency, cystic
fibrosis, and hepatitis. In contrast, low MBL levels have been described
as protective for mycobacterial infection. MBL deficiency is not typically associated with absent levels, and it has been difficult to define the
normal range in healthy people.
MASP-­1, the most abundant protease of the LP, has a central role in
pathway activation via MASP-­2. MASP-­1 may be involved in coagulation, renal, gastrointestinal, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-­
related pathology; there is no firm evidence for this type of pathology
in humans.
The Malpuech, Michels, Mingarelli, Carnevale (3MC) syndrome
is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder associated with pathogenic variants in the MASP1/3; COLEC11; or COLEC10 genes. The

number of 3MC patients with known pathogenic variants in these three
genes reported so far remains very small. The clinical manifestations of
the 3MC syndrome consist of developmental delay, facial dysmorphia,
and various skeletal anomalies. Developmental defects include cleft
lip and palate, postnatal growth deficiency, cognitive impairment, and
hearing loss. Excess or unusual infections and autoimmunity have not
yet been described in this syndrome. The proposed mechanism was
revealed by an unexpected role for these proteins in cuing neural crest
cell migration.
MASP-­2 deficiency was initially described in a patient with serious infections and autoimmune disease. MASP-­2 deficiency has been
included in the classification of primary immunodeficiencies. Asymptomatic individuals have been described; the frequency is 6/10,000, suggesting that the phenotype is mild. Healthy individuals homozygous for
p.D120G have also been found by chance in genetic association studies. These findings suggest that MASP-­2 deficiency could no longer be
associated to a specific clinical phenotype. In contrast, increased levels
of MBL or MASP-­2 may contribute to poor disease outcome associated
with mycobacterial infections or pneumococcal meningitis.
Complete ficolin-­3 (or H-­ficolin) deficiency was initially associated with increased susceptibility to infections and necrotizing enterocolitis. A heterogeneous range of clinical manifestations have been
described in patients with complete ficolin-­3 deficiency, and the first
case described was later diagnosed with Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome.
Respiratory and nervous system involvement in the few reported cases
of FCN3 deficiency raises awareness regarding the significance of ficolin-­3 in respiratory and nervous immunity.

DEFICIENCIES OF COMPLEMENT REGULATION

The CS has several levels of regulation at the initiation, amplification
(formation of convertases), and membrane attack phases, thereby preventing inadvertent tissue damage. Deficiency of complement inhibitors leads to dysregulation either in the fluid phase or on cell surfaces
and consequent recurrent infections (mostly bacterial), inflammatory disorders, and presentations with a broader clinical phenotype.
These include angioedema (C1-­INH deficiency), kidney and eye diseases (factor H, factor I, or CD46/MCP deficiency), protein-­losing
enteropathy (CD55/DAF deficiency), and PNH (CD55 + CD59 deficiency). In addition, there are seven complement receptors (C1qR, C3aR,
C5aR, CR1, CR2, CR3, and CR4). The same disease spectrum may be
caused and shaped by a broad variety of different alterations in complement activators and/or regulators. The individual complement profile
of a patient (sometimes referred to as complotype) often determines
the course and severity of the disease. Disorders such as AMD, aHUS,
or C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) are among the most well-­
described
examples in this context.
Approximately 50% of patients with aHUS have genetic pathogenic
variants of factors H and I, C3, factor B, and/or MCP, and deletion
of complement factor H–related proteins 1 and 3 (CFHR1/CFHR3).
Approximately 20% of patients with aHUS have pathologic variants
in more than one gene and patients with autoantibodies to regulatory
proteins also comprise a significant subset. The majority of aHUS cases
are sporadic and occur in the absence of prior family history. Furthermore, even in familial forms of aHUS, penetrance is incomplete.
Thrombomodulin (CD141) also has a regulatory role and binds to
factor H and C3b, thereby inhibiting complement activation. Interestingly, pathologic variants in factor H, MCP, and factor I have also been
reported in C3 MPGN, as well as preeclampsia and hemolysis, elevated
liver enzyme levels, and low platelet levels (HELLP) syndrome.
Several complement proteins, their activation products, and regulators have also been related to AMD, particularly, C3 and factors H and I.

Hereditary Angioedema

HAE comprises a group of diseases characterized by recurrent angioedema without wheals, showing an autosomal dominant inheritance
pattern. It was first recognized in patients with heterozygous deficiencies of C1-­INH and the estimated prevalence is 1:50,000 (Chapter 189.1). Patients with angioedema without wheals have also been
described with normal C1-­INH levels. Several pathogenic variants

were associated with this group of patients with primary angioedema:
factor XII (FXII-­
HAE), plasminogen (PLG-­
HAE), angiopoietin-­
1
(ANGPT1-­
HAE), kininogen-­
1 (KNG1-­
HAE), myoferlin (MYOF-­
HAE), and heparan sulfate-­
glucosamine 3-­
O-­sulfotransferase 6
(HS-­HAE). However, a significant proportion do not have a defined
molecular explanation.
The angioedema is self-­limited and recurrent, affecting the deep
layers of skin and mucosa, commonly causing swelling of extremities
(hands, feet, limbs), face, lips, tongue, genitalia, bowels, and the upper
airway. The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract causes severe
abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and, less frequently, diarrhea.
The symptoms can be misdiagnosed, and unnecessary surgery may be
performed. The obstruction of upper airways due to edema of the glottis is associated with asphyxia if the attacks are not prevented. Swelling
attacks are transitory and usually last from 2-­5 days, but their severity
and frequency vary widely from patient to patient. Approximately 5%
of people who carry a C1-­INH pathologic variant are asymptomatic.
In the most frequent subtype, HAE with C1-­INH deficiency (HAE-­
C1INH, OMIM #106100), the first HAE episodes occur at a mean age
of 10 years; however, the onset of symptoms may occur at an early age
(Chapter 189.1). This type of HAE is classified as type I when there
is low quantitative and functional C1-­INH levels (85% of the cases)
and type II for decreased functional C1-­INH values. A typical functional level is approximately 25–40% of normal in both types. Attacks,
when identified, are triggered by stress, trauma, hormones (estrogen),
infections, extreme temperatures, and alcohol. Although many patients
can identify triggers, many episodes have no identifiable trigger, which
increases anxiety and contributes to feelings of loss of control. The
symptoms are preceded by prodromes, such as erythema marginatum,
irritability, nausea, and flulike symptoms. Consumption of C2 and
C4 increases the risk for the development of SLE. Positive family history occurs in 75% of the cases and de novo pathogenic variants are
described in 25% of the cases.
The third type of HAE referred to as HAE with normal C1-­INH (previously called type III), is not a complement deficiency. It is characterized
by normal serum levels and functional activity of C1-­INH. It has been
described primarily in females; however, both sexes are affected.
Acquired C1-­INH deficiency is rarer than HAE-­C1-­INH (1:9)
and is clinically indistinguishable from inherited C1-­INH deficiency
except that onset is later in life (>40 years old). Patients with acquired
C1-­
INH deficiency require careful surveillance for malignancy;
B-­cell malignancies, autoimmunity, and monoclonal gammopathies
are the most common. The laboratory features are similar to those of
hereditary C1-­INH deficiency, except that C1q levels are diminished
in these patients. Anti–C1-­INH can be detected in approximately
70% of the cases.

C4 Binding Protein Deficiency

C4 binding protein deficiency has been described in one family. The
proband presented with angioedema, vasculitis, and arthritis. The
manifestations were thought to relate to uncontrolled activation of the
CP and the release of anaphylatoxins.

Factor H Deficiency

Factor H (CFH), which is present at high concentrations (500 μg/mL)
in plasma, works in both the liquid and solid phases and attenuates the
activity of C3 convertase in the AP and acts as a cofactor for factor I in
the cleavage of C3b and C4b. It is a multifunctional molecule that has the
function of decay acceleration and plays a very important role in regulating complement activation. Infections, aHUS, glomerulonephritis, and
macular degeneration are the main disease phenotypes seen in patients
with factor H deficiency. Infections occur due to secondary consumption of C3 with consequent partial deficiency. Diagnosis is suggestive
when C3 has diminished levels and low but not absent CH50 and AP50
is found. The antigenic levels of factor H are typically low.
Several people with MPGN were identified with factor H deficiency. CFH deficiency was found to be the underlying basis for the
pathophysiologic changes in 15–30% of patients with aHUS. aHUS
is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by hemolytic anemia,

1321

thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, which occurs in the absence of
its usual cause (infection with a Shiga toxin–producing organism). It is
called “atypical” because it lacks the common trigger of infectious diarrhea. CFH deficiency probably affects the ability to protect the fenestrated endothelium in the glomerulus from complement-­mediated
damage. Recurrent aHUS also has been seen in patients with antibodies to factor H, defining an acquired form as well. This form may
be slightly more amenable to therapy. Both autosomal recessive and
heterozygous pathogenic variants have been seen. The age at onset is
quite young in most cases, and the disease is recurrent. Mortality is not
uncommon. These patients have a diminished C3 level, although the
antigenic level of factor H typically is normal or elevated. Normal C3
levels are sometimes seen, and the only way in which this disorder can
be identified is with direct genetic analysis.
A common tyrosine-­histidine polymorphism of factor H was identified as a significant risk factor for macular degeneration with a higher
risk of the development of macular degeneration and blindness subsequently. In macular degeneration, the central region of the retina is
gradually destroyed by a process that leaves deposits of protein that
contain factor H and terminal complement components. It has been
hypothesized that the abnormal factor H provides less protection to
the choroidal vessels, allowing smoldering complement activation with
gradual damage to the endothelium.

FACTOR I DEFICIENCY

Not only factor H but also factor I is a key regulator of the AP. Deficiency of factor I results in uncontrolled activation of the AP with
subsequent secondary C3 deficiency and a reduction in circulating
factor H levels. Distinct clinical manifestations have been associated
with factor I deficiency. Marked susceptibility to infections relates to
the role of factor I as a cofactor for C3bBb dissociation. When factor
I is lacking, C3bBb continues to cleave C3 resulting in secondary C3
deficit. Both the CH50 and the AP50 are depressed but not absent,
and C3 antigen levels are low. In factor I deficiency, infections are
similar to those seen in true C3 deficiency. Neisserial disease has been
reported, as well as infections with encapsulated organisms such as
S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Partial factor I deficiency has been
described. aHUS, or MPGN II, has also been associated with factor I
deficiency, probably related to the capacity of complement regulatory
proteins to protect vascular endothelium from activating complement
after microtrauma. These cases of factor I deficiency are difficult to
identify because complement studies often give normal results. C3 may
be depressed but is not necessarily affected. The pathogenic variants
inactivate certain binding sites like surface-­bound C3b and polyanion
surfaces such as the fenestrated endothelium of the glomerulus, which
exposes the basement membrane. A third phenotype resembles an
autoinflammatory process and has been described in a small number of
patients. Central nervous system inflammation has been the hallmark.
Partial factor I deficiency has also been previously associated with clinical manifestations including recurrent tonsillitis, urinary infections,
otitis, pyelonephritis, severe meningitis, and sepsis.

Membrane Cofactor Protein (CD46) Deficiency

MCP is a membrane protein, and its defect is intrinsic to the kidney.
Deficiencies of MCP are associated with a later onset of atypical HUS
compared with factor H and factor I deficiencies and it accounts for
approximately 10% of all cases. There is no other known phenotype
for MCP deficiency. Findings on traditional complement analysis are
normal, although the mechanism is thought to be the same as for factor
H and factor I deficiencies. Considering the local defect, renal transplantation can be successful.

CD59 Deficiency

CD59 is the key membrane regulator of the TP that prevents insertion of the MAC into host tissue. It is expressed on most hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells, where it confers protection from
intravascular complement-­mediated lysis. Isolated CD59 deficiency

in CD59 was suspected in cases of chronic hemolysis because of the
phenotypic resemblance to PNH. PNH is caused by acquired somatic
variants of phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-­A) or phosphatidylinositol glycan class M (PIG-­M) in a clone of bone marrow progenitor cells. The protein product of PIG-­A is an anchoring structure
for C8 binding protein, DAF (CD55), and CD59. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-­anchored proteins protect hematopoietic cells from
complement-­mediated lysis. PNH is characterized by recurrent episodes of hemoglobinuria secondary to intravascular hemolysis and can
be associated with thrombosis and aplastic anemia. The red cells are the
most vulnerable because they have no ability to repair membrane damage. When the cells develop from the variant-­bearing progenitor, they
lack all GPI-­anchored membrane proteins, although the major features
relate to loss of CD59. The diagnosis of PNH is made by flow cytometry
for CD59 or CD55 (DAF).

Decay-­Accelerating Factor (CD55) Deficiency

DAF (CD55) is a membrane-­bound regulator that dissociates both
classical and alternative C3 convertases. In certain kindreds, DAF deficiency has been associated with protein-­losing enteropathy, whereas in
others, all of the members have been completely healthy, with the deficiency being identified at the time of blood donation or cross matching
for a transfusion. The Cromer blood group antigens reside on DAF. The
RBCs of people with the Cromer-­null phenotype, Inab, lack DAF but
do not appear to show increased susceptibility to hemolysis. This finding suggests that CD59 is substantially more important in regulating
red cell lysis by complement.

DEFICIENCIES OF COMPLEMENT RECEPTORS
CR1 Deficiency

CR1 (CD35) is a multiple modular protein that binds C3b/C4b-­
opsonized foreign antigens, mediating the immune adherence phenomenon. No cases of complete inherited CR1 deficiency have been
reported; however, acquired mild C1R deficiency is quite common in
patients with immune complex diseases and serum sickness. Similarly,
a polymorphic variant of CR1 with diminished levels and function has

been described, although it does not appear to be a risk factor for autoimmune disease.

CR3/CR4 Deficiency

CR3/CR4 deficiency (LFA-­1) is a defect in the 3 β2-­integrin adhesion
molecules. Pathogenic variants in the common β chain (CD18) lead to
failure to express adequate α chains: CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an autosomal recessive disorder
of neutrophil function resulting from a deficiency of β2-­integrin subunit of the leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (Table 173.5; see Chapter
170). The leukocyte cell adhesion molecule is present on the surface of
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and granulocytes and mediates cell-­cell and cell-­extracellular matrix adhesion. LAD is characterized by a delayed separation of the umbilical cord, recurrent bacterial
and fungal infections, and impaired pus formation and wound healing
associated with heavy mortality; bone marrow transplantation often is
recommended. The infections are characteristic in that necrosis predominates, with little neutrophilic infiltrate. With some residual β2-­
integrin expression, the patient may be able to survive without a bone
marrow transplant and infections are common.
The manifestations of the disorder are due to the combined effects of
ineffective opsonization and an inability to traverse the vascular endothelium to phagocytose bacteria. β2-­Integrins are essential for the firm
adhesion step and diapedesis. Lacking β2-­integrins, the neutrophils
remain in the vascular space, where they are unable to participate in
the defense against bacteria. This explains the lack of pus at sites of
active infection.
Two other forms of LAD are recognized: LAD type II is due to a
defect in fucosylation of selectin ligands and LAD type III is due to
an activation defect of integrins. The major manifestations are the
infection pattern just described and a moderate to severe bleeding tendency secondary to impaired activation of platelet adhesion molecules.
LAD-­III results from pathogenic variants in FERMT3, or KINDLIN3,
which encodes an intracellular protein that interacts with β-­integrins
in hematopoietic cells. In LAD-­III, the adhesive functions of integrins on both leukocytes and platelets are disrupted, most likely due

to defects in activation-­dependent alterations of surface integrins that
enable high-­avidity binding to ligands on target cells, a process termed
inside-­out signaling.

MANAGEMENT OF COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCIES

Prophylactic antibiotics may offer additional protection from serious infection. With the onset of unexplained fever, cultures should be
obtained and antibiotic therapy instituted rapidly and with less stringent indications than in an unaffected child. The parent or patient
should be given a written action plan describing any predisposition to
systemic bacterial infection or autoimmune disease associated with the
patient’s deficiency, along with the recommended initial approach to
management, for possible use by school, camp, or emergency department physicians. Therapy for infection is not standardized, but it is
usually directed to prevent infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.
Early complement component deficiencies have major risks to acquire
infections caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
Patients should also be vaccinated against encapsulated organisms
to maintain high titers. In the case of terminal component, factor D,
and properdin deficiencies, high levels of antibody after vaccination
may partially compensate for the complement deficiency. Effective vaccines are available; high titers of antibody may offer protection. Repeat
immunization of patients is advisable because complement deficiency
can be associated with a blunted or shorter-­lived antibody response
than normal. Immunization of household members may reduce the
risk of exposing patients to these pathogens.
Patients under immunosuppression for rheumatologic disorders
such as SLE will require more vigilance for severe infection. Individuals
with SLE and a complement defect generally respond as well to therapy
as do those without complement deficiency. Management of cardiac
risk factors is of heightened importance in early complement component–deficient individuals because of their accelerated atherosclerosis.
C1q deficiency has a poor prognosis and this protein is produced to a
large extent by myeloid cells. Bone marrow transplantation has been
curative and should be considered for C1q deficiency.
MBL purified from plasma or recombinant material has been administered in trials; however, no prospective study has been performed. In
addition, the role of MBL deficiency in significant infections is not well
established.
The treatment of HAE with C1-­INH deficiency is noted in Chapter
189.1. General guidance includes avoiding the use of estrogens or drugs
that can induce angioedema, such as angiotensin-­converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEis) and gliptins. If possible, trigger factors could be
avoided. Vaccination is not contraindicated, and hepatitis A and B
vaccinations are recommended. The approach includes long-­term prophylaxis (LTP), short-­term prophylaxis (STP), and on-­demand therapy
(Table 173.6; see Chapter 189.1).
STP is used for dental procedures, surgical procedures, endoscopies,
or other situations in which significant trauma may be expected. Attenuated androgens can be used for this indication; C1-­INH concentrates
have largely supplanted androgens in this setting. A recombinant C1-­
INH, conestat alfa, is effective for both HAE attacks and for STP. Fresh-­
frozen plasma (FFP) is another alternative in this setting.
Despite prophylaxis, breakthrough episodes do occur. On-­demand
therapy should also be an option for patients with sporadic attacks or
who may not be on any active prophylaxis. There are several options to
treat the attacks: C1-­INH concentrate; ecallantide, a kallikrein inhibitor; and icatibant, a bradykinin β2-­receptor antagonist.
On-­demand treatment and STP is the same for HAE with normal C1-­INH. LTP shows improvement with tranexamic acid and
progestins.

of regulation or inhibition manifests as immune dysregulation. Clinical
symptoms of these disorders include early onset multiorgan autoimmunity, endocrinopathy, enteropathy, colitis, and lymphoproliferation.

Immune Dysregulation

Diagnosis

Immune Dysregulation

In a patient with early-­onset, severe, or difficult to control autoimmunity, endocrinopathy, colitis, or nonmalignant lymphoproliferative
disease, a diagnosis of a Tregopathy should be considered. Next generation sequencing via a targeted panel and/or whole exome sequencing is
necessary to establish a genetic diagnosis.

Treatment

Chapter 174

Primary immune dysregulatory diseases (PIRDs) are a recognized subset
of primary immunodeficiencies that are characterized by hyperinflammation, organ-­specific and systemic autoimmunity, endocrinopathy, enteropathy, and nonmalignant lymphoproliferation. Clinical manifestations of
immune dysregulation should lead to a consideration of PIRD. Genetic
testing can confirm a diagnosis. Targeted treatments are available for many
PIRDs and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is often curative.

Targeted treatment is available for several Tregopathies (see Table
174.1). Abatacept, a CTLA4-­Ig fusion protein, has been used successfully in the treatment of refractory cytopenias, interstitial lung
disease, and lymphoproliferation in CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and
lipopolysaccharide-­responsive and beigelike anchor protein (LRBA)
deficiency. Jakinibs are a class of medications that inhibit Janus kinase
activation of certain STAT transcription factors. Jakinibs have been
used successfully to treat immune dysregulatory and autoimmune
symptoms in gain-­of-­function of STAT1 and STAT3 diseases. HCT can
provide a curative option for many Tregopathies.

ENTEROPATHY, X-­LINKED SYNDROME

174.1 Tregopathies
Danielle E. Arnold and Jennifer W. Leiding
Tregopathies are a subset of primary immunodeficiency diseases recognized by the International Union of Immunologic Societies. The clinical
manifestations of these diseases are variable, but all involve some degree
of immune dysregulation manifesting as autoimmunity, hyperinflammation, cancer predisposition, and/or lymphoproliferative disease.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

T regulatory (Treg) cells are specialized T cells responsible for the
maintenance and self-­tolerance of immune responses (Fig. 174.1).
These cells are responsible for suppressing production of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors and suppressing T-­cell proliferation. The transcription factor FOXP3 is essential for the regulatory
function of Treg cells. Several subsets of Treg cells exist, each characterized by unique features. Thymic-­
derived Treg cells (tTreg)
(CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) account for ∼5% of total CD4+ T cells in the
peripheral blood. FOXP3+ Treg cells can also differentiate outside of
the thymus in peripheral tissues. These cells are known as peripherally induced regulatory (pTreg) cells. A number of monogenic diseases
(Table 174.1) of the immune system that affect the number and/or
function of Treg cells have been described. By reducing the effect of
Treg cells, T-­cell activation and proliferation are unrestrained. This lack

This immune dysregulation syndrome is characterized by onset within
the first few weeks or months of life with watery diarrhea (autoimmune
enteropathy), an eczematous rash (erythroderma in neonates), insulin-­
dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism or more often hypothyroidism, severe allergies, and other autoimmune disorders (Coombs-­positive
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia). Psoriasiform or ichthyosiform rashes and alopecia have also been reported.
Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-­linked
(IPEX) syndrome is caused by a pathogenic variant in the FOXP3 gene,
which encodes a forkhead-­winged helix transcription factor (scurfin)
involved in the function and development of CD4+ CD25+ Tregs. The
absence of Tregs may predispose to abnormal activation of effector T
cells. Variants in multiple other genes also produce an IPEX-­like syndrome (see Table 174.1; Fig. 174.2).

Clinical Manifestations

Watery diarrhea with intestinal villous atrophy leads to failure to thrive in
most patients. Cutaneous lesions (usually eczema) and insulin-­dependent
diabetes begin in infancy. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are also
present. Serious bacterial infections (meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis) may be related to neutropenia, malnutrition, or immune dysregulation. Laboratory features reflect the associated autoimmune diseases,
dehydration, and malnutrition. In addition, serum IgE levels are elevated,

through inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) function and maturation, through
the secretion of anti-­inflammatory cytokines such as IL-­10, TGF-­β, and
IL-­35, and/or through direct inhibition of Teff via induction of cytolysis
using granzyme and metabolic disruption. Moreover, Tregs can reduce

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe systemic
hyperinflammatory syndrome that can be aggressive and life-­
threatening. Classic features include fever, cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, coagulopathy, and elevations in inflammatory markers.
Primary or genetic HLH is due to pathogenic variants in genes that
predispose patients to HLH by a variety of mechanisms and includes
classic familial HLH due to pathogenic variants in PRF1, UNC13D,
STX11, and STXBP2; certain pigmentary disorders; and other primary

immunodeficiencies or immune regulatory disorders (see Chapter 556.2;
Fig. 174.3). Primary HLH is seen most frequently in pediatric patients but
may occur at all ages.
Secondary HLH occurs in the setting of a medical condition
that results in intense immune activation such as severe infection,
malignancy, or rheumatologic disease. Many primary immune
deficiencies (PIDs) are also associated with an increased risk of
HLH, usually in the setting of infection. HLH has been reported
in patients with severe combined immune deficiency and chronic
granulomatous disease, but secondary HLH has been seen in a wide
variety of PID. Several inborn errors of metabolism can also present
with secondary HLH.
Of note, patients with primary or genetic HLH often present with HLH
triggered by or “secondary” to infection or other immune activating events.
For more details see Chapter 556.2.

174.3 Epstein-­Barr Virus Susceptibility
­Disorders
Danielle E. Arnold and Jennifer W. Leiding
Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma-­herpes family virus with a marked
tropism for B cells. Most individuals experience asymptomatic infection
or infectious mononucleosis, a self-­limiting lymphoproliferative disease
that is particularly common in adolescents. EBV is also an oncogenic
virus and may induce several types of neoplasms, including B-­cell,
T-­cell, and natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas; nasopharyngeal and
gastric carcinomas; and EBV-­associated smooth muscle cell tumors.
During primary infection, EBV-­infected B cells are eliminated by
EBV-­specific cytotoxic T cells as well as other innate cytotoxic lymphocytes such as NK cells, γδ T cells, and invariant natural killer T
(iNKT) cells. However, some EBV-­infected B cells escape the immune
response, establishing a reservoir for EBV that may reactivate

throughout an individual’s life. These reactivations are typically
asymptomatic in healthy individuals; however, in immunocompromised persons, EBV reactivations and persistence and expansion of
latently infected B lymphoblasts may result in symptomatic and often
severe disease.

Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis, and Treatment

More than 50% of patients with EBV susceptibility disorders experience at least one episode of EBV lymphoproliferative disease.
Patients are also susceptible to other EBV-­
driven pathologies,
including HLH and both Hodgkin and non-­Hodgkin lymphoma.
Other severe viral infections (e.g., other herpesviruses, human
herpesvirus 6 [HHV-­6]), bacterial infections, particularly recurrent pulmonary infections, and hypogammaglobulinemia and/
or dysgammaglobulinemia are also common. Diagnosis for these
disorders is with a full immune evaluation and genetic testing.
Treatment includes rituximab (anti-­CD20 antibody) to eliminate
EBV-­infected B cells, treatment of infections, and immunoglobulin

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

There are several primary combined immunodeficiencies characterized by a very high predisposition to EBV infection, some of
which are listed in Table 174.2. These disorders are due to defects
in pathways involved in T-­and B-­cell interaction and crosstalk (Fig.
174.4). Disruption of these pathways results in aberrant cytotoxic
T-­cell activation, migration, proliferation, and/or cytolytic activity
in response to antigenic stimulation and, thus, impaired immune
surveillance of B cells by T cells. Marked decrease or absence of

treatment available.

Other Primary Immunodeficiencies Associated with
Epstein-­Barr Virus Lymphoproliferative Disease

Herpesvirus infections and EBV lymphoproliferative disease are also
seen to a lesser extent in several other combined immunodeficiencies associated with T-­cell defects, particularly those affecting T-­cell
survival and mobilization. Classic examples include Wiskott-­Aldrich
syndrome, DOCK8 deficiency, GATA2 haploinsufficiency, and activated PI3K-­delta syndrome, among others. Severe EBV infections may
also be seen in patients with hypomorphic or leaky severe combined
immunodeficiency.
Any patient who presents with prolonged and/or severe EBV lymphoproliferative disease or EBV-­positive lymphoma warrants evaluation for an underlying primary immunodeficiency.

174.4 Chronic Active Epstein-­Barr Virus
Danielle E. Arnold and Jennifer W. Leiding
Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) is a rare systemic EBV lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by fever, persistent lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and hepatitis in the absence of an underlying primary
or secondary immunodeficiency, malignancy, or autoimmune disorder.

GENETIC PREDISPOSITION

CAEBV is seen primarily in persons of East Asian (Japan, Korea,
China, and Taiwan) or Latin American (Indigenous people in Mexico
and Central/South America) ancestry; in these patients, EBV is predominantly present in T cells or NK cells. Conversely, while rare, persons of Western European descent typically have B-­cell CAEBV. The
uneven geographic distribution of CAEBV suggests that underlying
genetic factors may contribute to the development of CAEBV; heterozygous pathogenic variants in HLH predisposing genes (e.g., perforin)
have been identified in patients with CAEBV. Causative genetic defects
have not been identified in most cases.

Pathophysiology

The mechanism of EBV entry into T cells or NK cells is unclear, but
T cells and NK cells can express low levels of CD21, the EBV receptor, during primary infection. The pathogenesis of CAEBV is less clear.
Evidence suggests that EBV infection directly induces T-­cell or NK
cell survival via activation of several survival-­promoting molecules

Table 174.3  Chronic Active EBV (CAEBV) Diagnostic
Criteria
All 4 criteria must be present:
1.	Sustained or recurrent infectious mononucleosis-­like symptoms
persisting for >3 mo
2.	EBV PCR >102.5 copies/μg DNA in the peripheral blood or tissue
lesion
3.	Evidence of EBV infection of T or NK cells in the peripheral blood
or affected tissues
4.	Exclusion of other diagnoses: primary EBV infection, primary or
secondary immunodeficiency, malignancy, autoimmune disease
EBV, Epstein-­Barr virus; NK, natural killer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

or pathways, including upregulation of co-­stimulatory molecules that
suppress apoptosis, activation of the NF-­κB pathway, and upregulation
of activation-­induced cytidine deaminase, which acts as a genomic disruptor and has been shown to play a role in EBV-­induced lymphomagenesis in B cells.

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis

Clinical manifestations of CAEBV are heterogenous, ranging from a
mild and indolent clinical course to a more aggressive and potentially
fatal illness due to complications such as HLH, multisystem organ
failure, and/or progression to leukemia or lymphoma. Clinical manifestations may by episodic, but patients typically have persistently and
markedly elevated levels of EBV in the blood throughout their disease
course. Infiltration of tissues by EBV-­positive lymphocytes may result in
organ failure (liver failure is commonly seen), and EBV-­infected T cells
and NK cells may undergo malignant transformation. The diagnostic
criteria for CAEBV are listed in Table 174.3; CAEBV should be suspected in any patient with sustained inflammation of unknown origin
and chronically elevated EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) levels.
Evaluations to determine whether EBV is predominantly present in
T cells or NK cells should be undertaken, if possible, in patients with
CAEBV. One method is EBV PCR on peripheral blood mononuclear
cells that have been sorted by flow cytometry, although this test is not
widely available. Histologic examination of tissue that has been infiltrated by EBV-­infected lymphocytes by immune staining and in situ
hybridization of EBV-­encoded mRNA (EBER) is another approach.

Treatment

Treatment options in severe cases are limited, and clinical responses
are mostly transient. Some therapeutic approaches include

immunomodulatory therapy, combination bortezomib and ganciclovir, and EBV-­specific T cells. Patients with HLH should receive HLH-­
directed therapy. Standard antiviral therapy is not effective. Cytotoxic
chemotherapy is also used to reduce disease activity and burden of
EBV-­infected lymphocytes, primarily as a bridge to HCT. Allogeneic
HCT is the only definitive therapy available with overall survival rates
as high as 87% in some reports. Patients with progressive disease
remain difficult to transplant. As such, some advocate rapidly proceeding to HCT early in the disease process, although the timing of HCT
remains controversial.

with classic symptoms of IBD including weight loss, failure to thrive,
abdominal pain, fever, constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia. The phenotype is heterogenous with some children having mild disease and
others presenting with or developing more severe disease over time.
Approximately 40% have extensive pancolonic disease at presentation.
Extent, location, and histology can progress or change over time.

174.5 Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel
Disease
Danielle E. Arnold and Jennifer W. Leiding
Inflammatory bowel disease that presents in children less than 6 years
of age is known as very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-­
IBD). Monogenic defects involved in primary immunodeficiency and
intestinal barrier processes are enriched in children with VEO-­IBD
(Fig. 174.5). Targeted therapies in children with VEO-­IBD with a
monogenic defect have been successful in treating disease manifestations (see Chapter 382.3).

DISEASE CLASSIFICATION AND CLINICAL
PRESENTATION

Children diagnosed with IBD <2 years of age are referred to as
infantile-­onset IBD and those 2-­6 years as VEO-­IBD. Children present

Autoimmune cytopenias are a group of disorders in which there is
immune destruction of differentiated hematopoietic cells. Immune
destruction can be autoantibody mediated or non-­autoantibody mediated. Single lineage disease can affect red cells (autoimmune hemolytic
anemia [AIHA]), platelets (idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura
[ITP]), or neutrophils (autoimmune neutropenia [AIN]). Bilineage or
trilineage disease can affect any combination of these cell lines. Evan
disease is a combination of AIHA and ITP.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The etiology of autoimmune cytopenias as a manifestation of an inborn
error of immunity is often multifactorial with autoantibody-­mediated
destruction or cellular-­mediated destruction of red blood cells, platelets, or neutrophils as the major causes of hemolysis (Table 174.4).
In disorders with intrinsic B-­cell defects and disrupted T-­and B-­cell
interactions, autoantibody production toward hematopoietic cells can

occur. When B-­cell maturation is impaired, vital steps in the induction
of tolerance are omitted. In addition to the humoral B-­cell defects that
can lead to autoimmune cytopenias, intrinsic defects in T-­cell effector
function can lead to cellular autoimmunity. Impaired T-­cell development can cause a lack of functional effector cells against non-­self or
“dangerous” antigens while allowing production of autoreactive clones
with T-­cell receptors directed against self-­antigens. Additionally, T-­cell
defects may lead to a reduction in FOXP3+ Treg cells.

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis

The clinical presentation of AIHA commonly includes dizziness,
fatigue, pallor, jaundice, and exertional dyspnea (see Chapter 513).
Complete blood count will show anemia and reticulocytosis. Additional features of hemolysis include hyperbilirubinemia, elevated
lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased haptoglobin levels. Direct antiglobulin testing is most often positive. ITP typically presents with
bleeding episodes that can range from mild bruising, petechiae, and
epistaxis to oral purpura, hematuria, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal
hemorrhage, or intracranial bleeding (see Chapter 533.1). Severe
life-­threatening bleeding is rare. Laboratory findings include acute
thrombocytopenia. Mean platelet volume is elevated or variable indicating that large new platelets are being generated to compensate for
loss. Autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins may be positive
but are not helpful in elucidating immune thrombocytopenia as they
are positive in less than 65% of patients with immune thrombocytopenia and are not predictive, specific, or prognostic. AIN presents with low absolute neutrophil count (see Chapter 171). Clinical
manifestations include aphthous stomatitis, periodontal disease, and
increased frequency of soft tissue infections. Invasive infections and
sepsis are rare. Antigranulocyte antibodies can be present.

Immunodeficiencies Associated with Autoimmune
Cytopenias

Autoimmune cytopenias, especially those that include bilineages
and trilineages, are often a presenting symptom of or associated
with primary immunodysregulatory disorders. Other organ-­specific
immunodysregulatory and autoimmune conditions are often present. Next generation sequencing via whole exome sequencing or
panel-­based sequencing can aid in establishing a diagnosis. When
an inborn error of immunity is suspected with the presence of autoimmune cytopenias, a general immune screen should be performed
including serum quantities of IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE. Quantities of
T cell, B cell, and NK cells should also be measured. Additional labs
that may be helpful in narrowing a diagnosis of immunodeficiency
include quantification of αβ+double negative T cells (CD4−CD8−),
CD27+IgD+ and CD27+IgD− memory B cells, serum ferritin, soluble
interleukin (IL)-­2 receptor, IL-­18, soluble Fas ligand, vitamin B12,
and folate.

Treatment

Targeted treatment of the primary immunodysregulatory disorder
can control or resolve autoimmune cytopenias. Standard treatment of
autoimmune cytopenias with or without a primary immunodysregulatory disorder include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG), and biologic therapies such as rituximab and daratumumab
(monoclonal antibody against CD38 expressed on long-­lived plasma
cells). Control of symptoms is often more difficult and may increase
the suspicion for an underlying primary immunodysregulatory
disorder.

174.7 Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative
Syndrome
Danielle E. Arnold and Jennifer W. Leiding
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), also known as
Canale-­Smith syndrome, is a disorder of abnormal lymphocyte apoptosis leading to polyclonal populations of T cells (double-­negative T
cells), which express CD3 and α/β antigen receptors but do not have
CD4 or CD8 co-­receptors (CD3+ T-­cell receptor α/β+, CD4−CD8−).
These T cells respond poorly to antigens or mitogens and do not produce growth or survival factors (IL-­2). The genetic deficit in most
patients is a germline or somatic pathologic variant in the FAS gene,
which produces a cell surface receptor of the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor superfamily (TNFRSF6), which, when stimulated by
its ligand, will produce programmed cell death (Table 174.5). Persistent survival of these lymphocytes leads to immune dysregulation and
autoimmunity. ALPS is also caused by other genes in the Fas pathway
(FASLG and CASP10). In addition, ALPS-­like disorders are associated
with other mutations: RAS-­
associated autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder (RALD), caspase-­8 deficiency, Fas-­associated protein
with death domain deficiency (FADD), and protein kinase C delta deficiency (PRKCD). These disorders have varying degrees of immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and lymphoproliferation.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

ALPS is characterized by autoimmunity, chronic persistent or
recurrent lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly (in
50%), and hypergammaglobulinemia (IgG, IgA). Many patients
present in the first year of life, and most are symptomatic by age 5
years. Lymphadenopathy can be striking (Fig. 174.6). Splenomegaly

may produce hypersplenism. Autoimmunity also produces anemia (Coombs-­positive hemolytic anemia) or thrombocytopenia or
a mild neutropenia. The lymphoproliferative process (lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly) may regress over time, but autoimmunity
does not regress and is characterized by frequent exacerbations and
recurrences. Other autoimmune features include urticaria, uveitis,
glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, vasculitis, panniculitis, arthritis, premature ovarian failure, thyroiditis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and CNS
involvement (seizures, headaches, encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, Guillain-­Barré syndrome, ataxia).
Malignancies are also more common in patients with ALPS and
include Hodgkin and non-­
Hodgkin lymphomas and solid-­
tissue

tumors of thyroid, skin, heart, or lung. ALPS is one cause of Evan syndrome (immune thrombocytopenia and immune hemolytic anemia).

Diagnosis

Laboratory abnormalities depend on the lymphoproliferative organ
response (hypersplenism) or the degree of autoimmunity (anemia,
thrombocytopenia). There may be lymphocytosis or lymphopenia.
Table 174.5 lists the criteria for the diagnosis. Flow cytometry helps
identify the lymphocyte type (see Fig. 174.6). Functional genetic
analysis for the TNFRSF6 gene often reveals a heterozygous mutation. The differential diagnosis of ALP-­related syndromes is noted
in Table 174.6.

Chapter 175 u Defects of Innate Immunity

Chapter 175

Defects of Innate
Immunity
Jenna R.E. Bergerson and
Alexandra F. Freeman
The innate immune system is the body’s first defense against pathogens, and includes barriers such as the skin as well as neutrophils,
natural killer (NK) cells, the toll-­like receptors (TLRs) for microbial
pathogen recognition, cytokines, and the complement system. Breakdown of different parts of this system can predispose primarily to different pathogens, such as viruses, fungi, bacteria, and mycobacteria.
The innate immune system also plays an important role in engaging the
adaptive immune response.

175.1 Predisposition to Fungal Infections
Jenna R.E. Bergerson and Alexandra F. Freeman
Despite constant exposure to environmental fungi at sites like the
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the skin, immunocompetent individuals do not develop invasive fungal disease because highly
sophisticated host defenses have evolved with time. The genetic basis
for inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) presenting with mucocutaneous
and/or invasive fungal disease have provided valuable insight into the
immunologic mediators necessary for antifungal host defense. Certain IEIs whose phenotype includes fungal disease, such as chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD), APECED, GATA2 deficiency, and
dominant negative STAT3 pathogenic variants (Job syndrome), are
examples.
Candida and Aspergillus are the two most commonly encountered
opportunistic fungi in clinical practice; both of these fungi are recognized in host tissues by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell
surface. When triggered by a relevant ligand, activation of these receptors results in pathogen uptake and killing. Most relevant to antifungal
immunity is the C-­type lectin receptor (CLR) family, which recognizes
specific fungal cell wall components called pathogen-­associated molecular patterns, like β-­glucans or mannans. When CLRs like Dectin-­1
bind ligand, the CARD9/BCL10/MALT1 complex (BCM complex) is
formed. Signaling via downstream pathways ultimately results in production of proinflammatory cytokines and promotes fungal uptake
and killing by myeloid phagocytes.
The molecular mechanisms that protect against host mucosal infections with Candida spp. are vastly different than those that confer
protection against systemic infection. Neutrophils, monocytes, and
macrophages are seemingly dispensable for immunity to mucosal
Candida infection; chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is not
seen in neutropenic patients or those with CGD. Instead, mucocutaneous candidiasis seems to correlate with impairments in T-­lymphocyte
number or function. Interleukin (IL)-­17 signaling is also a critical
pathway for protection against CMC. On receptor activation, the adaptor molecule ACT1 is recruited to the IL-­17 receptor and mediates the
induction of signaling pathways that upregulate the transcription of
cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that help clear Candida
from the mucosal surfaces. Control of endemic fungi, such as Histoplasma, is dependent on the IL-­12/IFNg/STAT1 pathway.
Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is characterized by severe,
persistent, or recurrent symptomatic infection of the nails, skin, oral,
or genital mucosa by the Candida genus. CMC has been associated
with a number of IEIs, in which it is one of many disease features along
with other infections and/or autoimmune manifestations. However,

1335

CMC can also be a main feature of a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) (Table 175.1).
Antifungal therapy is the hallmark of treatment in these diseases.
Episodes of CMC typically respond to either topical or oral therapy.
Recurrences are common without secondary prophylaxis. Prophylaxis
should be initiated in those patients with frequent and early recurrences
after discontinuation of antifungal therapy. Prophylaxis is important
not only to reduce the morbidity associated with recurrent episodes of
CMC, but also to prevent mucosal inflammation, which can increase
the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Repeated courses of antifungal
therapy increase the risk of developing resistance to antifungal therapy.
All cases of CMC should be confirmed with culture, and susceptibility
testing should guide the choice of antifungal if a therapeutic response
is not observed.
Systemic fungal disease should be guided by culture and susceptibility data with consideration of antifungal penetration in the affected
tissue. Additional factors to consider include concomitant medications
(triazoles are metabolized by P450 and prolong the QT interval with
the exception of isavuconazole, which shortens it), liver function, and
kidney function (amphotericin use). It is important to also consider
that voriconazole is associated with additional toxicities including an
increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, fluorosis, peripheral neuropathy, and visual disturbances. Survival of life-­threatening
fungal infection should also mandate secondary antifungal prophylaxis
unless the underlying immunodeficiency is cured by hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

CARD9 DEFICIENCY

CARD9 deficiency is caused by biallelic loss-­of-­function (LOF) pathogenic variants in CARD9. CARD9 contributes to antifungal host
defense in a pathogen-­and organ-­specific manner with a striking
predilection for Candida albicans central nervous system (CNS) infections. CARD9 deficiency is the only known IEI in which patients are
predisposed to both mucocutaneous and systemic candidiasis, with C.
albicans typically isolated. The CNS is the most common site of systemic involvement, with CNS candidiasis often presenting as either
meningoencephalitis or an intracranial abscess ± obstructive hydrocephalus. The next most common site of systemic involvement is bone.
Neutrophils are absent in all involved exudates and tissues.
Deep dermatophytosis and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis
infections can also be seen in CARD9 deficiency. Trichophyton rubrum
and Trichophyton violaceum were the most common dermatophyte
species. Severe complications like lymphadenitis, extension into adjacent organs with fistula formation, and dissemination to the CNS have
been seen. Dermal biopsies show necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, subcutaneous nodules, and severe ulceration of the superficial tissues. Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis with a predilection for
facial involvement has also been reported. Granulomatous inflammation with scattered lymphocytes and eosinophils are seen on biopsy.
Extrapulmonary aspergillosis and a variety of dematiaceous fungi have
also been reported including Phialophora verrucosa, Exophiala spinifera, Ochroconis musae, and Corynespora cassiicola.
Clinical manifestations of CARD9 deficiency are fully penetrant by
the fourth or fifth decade of life with about 40% of patients presenting in adulthood. Sequencing of CARD9 is required to establish the
diagnosis, and determination of functional consequences of CARD9
variants is difficult. Lymphocyte phenotyping is usually normal, as
are absolute neutrophil and monocyte counts despite a lack of neutrophils in infected CSF. Nearly 60% of affected patients have findings
of elevated serum IgE and/or hypereosinophilia. Treatment of fungal
infection follows the tenets outlined earlier, frequently with infectious diseases consultation followed by lifelong antifungal prophylaxis
unless HSCT is successfully performed. Two patients with CARD9
deficiency have been successfully treated with HSCT leading to clinical
remission. There is a potential role for treatment of fungal disease with
granulocyte-­macrophage colony-­stimulating factor (GM-­CSF) therapy
in CARD9 deficiency, but there is variability in response that may relate
to the underlying pathogenic variant(s) responsible for disease; thus
seeking expert advice is recommended.

STAT1 GOF

STAT1 gain-­
of-­
function (GOF) pathogenic variants present with
CMC, autoimmunity, intracranial aneurysms, and/or squamous cell
carcinoma. This condition likely accounts for more than 50% of CMC
cases; CMC affects most patients with this diagnosis and typically presents in the first year of life. Candida involvement of the oropharynx is
most common, but esophagitis, genital, and skin and nail disease are
also common. C. albicans is the most common cause of CMC, but other
Candida species have also been isolated. Azole resistance is a major
challenge over time making treatment difficult.
Invasive fungal infections are less common in this disease but can
be quite severe. Disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, and Paracoccidioides can be difficult to treat and, in some cases,
have been fatal. Pulmonary and disseminated mold infections have been
reported infrequently and include organisms such as Aspergillus, Nannizziopsis, and Mucorales. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia has been
reported rarely.
A wide range of other types of pathogens cause infections in this
patient population as well including recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary
infections, typically due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Bronchiectasis, when present,
may further produce susceptibility to pathogens such as Pseudomonas.
Less commonly skin infections such as folliculitis or cellulitis are also
observed. Mycobacterial infections are typically due to BCG in those
from countries that routinely immunize against tuberculosis (TB), and
nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) adenitis or TB, or NTM lung

infections. NTM infections do not usually disseminate widely in STAT1
GOF as they do in autosomal recessive or dominant STAT1 LOF.
Severe or recurrent viral infections, most commonly due to herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus [HSV], varicella-­zoster virus [VZV],
Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus [CMV], BK, and JC), are
also troublesome in over 30% of patients. Recurrent oral mucocutaneous disease due to HSV or recurrent VZV infection are the most
frequent viral disease manifestations. EBV and CMV viremias are
commonly detected, but CMV disease is infrequent as is symptomatic
EBV disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-­driven warts and molluscum are seen in a small number of these patients and are difficult
to treat. Although rare, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML) from JC virus is of particular concern due to its high mortality.
PML has been seen with and without additional immune modulation;
therapies that are sometimes indicated for the autoimmunity seen in
STAT1 GOF, such as rituximab, need to be used with caution.
Additional disease manifestations include autoimmunity, vasculopathy, and malignancy. Autoimmune thyroid disease is most common, but type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anemia,
autoimmune cytopenias, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus-­like
disease have all been observed and, in many cases, the autoimmune
manifestations can be quite refractory and difficult to control. Aphthous ulcers are also especially common and can be very painful.
Cerebral aneurysms are the most common vasculopathy seen, but
extracerebral vascular abnormalities occur as well. These aneurysms
may be the result of vasculitis, perhaps from pathogens like VZV; serial

Chapter 175 u Defects of Innate Immunity
prospective imaging should be a part of routine screening. The most
common malignancy observed is squamous cell carcinoma, mainly of
the skin, oropharynx, and esophagus. Chronic inflammation caused
by mucosal Candida infections may play an important role, as well as
inflammation driven by increased STAT1 activity.
Management has been largely targeted against the infections and
treatment of autoimmunity when present. Many of the patients need
antifungal prophylaxis, and azole resistance may emerge and limit
therapeutic choices to topical nystatin or amphotericin washes, or IV
echinocandins. It is worth highlighting that voriconazole is not recommended in this patient population due to its photosensitivity and long-­
term skin cancer risk. In those patients with recurrent sinopulmonary
infections and/or bronchiectasis, antibiotic prophylaxis is likely to be
beneficial. Azithromycin prophylaxis, if pulmonary NTM is not present, may be beneficial not only for prevention of recurrent airway
infections, but also will yield some antiinflammatory benefits. Recurrent HSV or VZV infections suggest the need for prophylaxis with
acyclovir or valacyclovir. The autoimmunity is typically treated with
immune suppression, and many have received long courses of corticosteroids. However, there are positive reports of success controlling this
inflammation and autoimmunity with JAK inhibition. Ruxolitinib has
been used in STAT1 GOF to treat alopecia, enteropathy, autoimmune
cytopenias, and hepatitis. There is one report of JAK inhibition being
used early in the course of associated insulin-­dependent diabetes, with
resolution of the need for insulin and remission of the diabetes. JAK
inhibition also can be highly effective in the treatment of CMC because
there is growing evidence that the CMC observed in this disease is due
to exuberant inflammation rather than infection susceptibility. Severe
or disseminated infections have progressed while on JAK inhibition,
thus, it is best to start this treatment only when invasive infections are
adequately controlled. Some patients develop hypogammaglobulinemia
over time; immune globulin replacement may be indicated. HSCT is
not yet the preferred option for treatment of STAT1 GOF. HSCT in
this population of patients has been difficult with high morbidity and
mortality, although it is important to note that many of these transplants were done before the genetic diagnosis was known and a variety
of conditioning regimens were used.

IL-­17F DEFICIENCY

A dominant-­
negative missense pathogenic variant in IL17F was
reported in multiple patients from one kindred with CMC. About 65%
of these patients had CMC manifesting as persistent thrush, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and interdigital intertrigo. Lymphocyte phenotyping and quantitative immunoglobulin levels were normal in the one
patient who had such testing. Diagnosis relies on sequencing of IL-­17F,
but can also be suspected if flow cytometry shows absent intracellular
IL-­17F producing CD3+ cells in patients with detectable IL-­17A and
IL-­22 producing CD3+ cells. Although there is insufficient clinical
information to suggest ideal management of patients with IL-­17F deficiency, we recommend a similar approach as outlined for management
of CMC.

IL-­17RA DEFICIENCY

IL-­17RA deficiency also presents with CMC, but usually with onset
within the first year of life. Candidiasis involved the oropharynx in 95%
of patients, the genitals in 38% (60% females), the skin or scalp in 67%,
and the nails in 19%. Episodes of CMC seemed to respond to topical
or oral therapy. Staphylococcal skin infections were seen in 65% of the
cohort, with such lesions also manifesting in the first year of life. Bacterial recurrent sinopulmonary infections occur in just over one-­third of
these patients, and all responded to antibiotic therapy.
Lymphocyte phenotyping is normal, and diagnosis should be made
by sequencing of the IL17RA gene, particularly when early-­onset CMC
and concurrent S. aureus skin infections are present.
As CMC is a presenting feature of all reported patients with IL-­17RA
deficiency, oral antifungal prophylaxis should be initiated. Strong consideration should be given to also initiating antibiotic prophylaxis in
those who have culture-­proven bacterial infections that are recurrent

1337

or severe. In those with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, although
the spectrum of organisms is not known, covering for common bacterial etiologies like S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis should be sufficient to prevent disease.

175.2 Innate Immunity Defects with
Predominant Susceptibility to Viral
Infections
Jenna R.E. Bergerson and Alexandra F. Freeman
Defects in innate immunity that predispose to viral infections are
divided into three main groups: those primarily predisposing to HPV,
those predisposing primarily to HSV encephalitis, and those predisposing to other viruses, many of which interfere with interferon (IFN)
signaling. Some of these defects are described in the following sections
along with other rare defects highlighted in Table 175.2.

PREDOMINANT HPV SUSCEPTIBILITY

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is the main clinical presentation for diseases with autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in the
transmembrane channel-­like 6 and 8 (TMC6 and TMC8) genes and
more recently described in the calcium-­and integrin-­binding protein
1 (CIB1) gene, encoding for the proteins EVER1, EVER2, and CIB1,
respectively. EVER1, EVER2, and CIB1 complex together for keratinocyte intrinsic immunity, and disruption of this complex leads to
HPV susceptibility. The typical warts affecting healthy individuals are
from α-­HPV types; however, in EV, β-­HPV causes symptomatic disease, which is usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals but associated with cancer in some immune compromised individuals. The warts
are frequently not the typical verrucous appearance seen in healthy
children, but are usually flat warts, and can look like tinea versicolor
with pigment changes. The warts appear in sun-­exposed areas and
have a high incidence of cancer transformation. Individuals with EV
do not usually have increased risk of other infections; they have normal immune evaluations including normal lymphocyte number and
function. Diagnosis is with genetic testing after suspicion with atypical widespread HPV disease. There is no specific treatment, although
warts are treated with standard therapies (see Chapter 708). Patients
needed to be counseled to avoid UV and radiation exposure, and these
individuals need frequent screening for skin cancer.
WHIM (wart, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, myelokathexis) syndrome is an autosomal dominant (AD) disease caused by
GOF pathogenic variants in CXCR4. Increased responsiveness of the
CXCR4 receptor to its ligand CXCL12 (also known as SDF-­1) results
in increased retention of the neutrophils in the bone marrow and thus
the finding of myelokathexis (neutropenia related to the inability of
neutrophils to leave the marrow). Patients also have lymphopenia with
decreased B-­, T-­and NK lymphocytes, along with hypogammaglobulinemia. Although recurrent infections are common, they tend not to
be as severe as expected from the neutropenia because the neutrophils
often are released from the bone marrow with infection; dental issues
likely related to the neutropenia are common. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections likely relate more to the hypogammaglobulinemia, and
some patients develop bronchiectasis. Warts typically start in childhood
or adolescence and are often particularly severe with poor response to
therapy. Evolution into squamous cell carcinomas can occur; patients
require monitoring. Treatment traditionally has been supportive in
treating infections and preventive with immune globulin therapy and
G-­CSF, which usually needs to be dosed at lower concentrations due to
frequently experienced debilitating bone pain. Plerixafor, an antagonist
of CXCR4, may provide a specific therapy.
There are several other PIDDs that primarily affect lymphocytes that
have HPV susceptibility as a major component and are discussed in

1338 Part XII u Immunology
other chapters. Many of these diseases, such as DOCK8 deficiency and
GATA2 deficiency, have broader susceptibility than just HPV. CD28
deficiency has susceptibility specific for HPV resulting in warts and
cutaneous horns. Compared to EV, those with CD28 deficiency have
predisposition to the more common α-­ and γ-­HPV types.

Predisposition to Severe Viral Infections

Host control of viral infections is predominately dependent on normal type 1 IFN signaling (Fig. 175.1; see Table 175.2). Type 1 IFNs,
including the IFN-­α subtypes and IFN-­β, bind to their heteroreceptor
comprising IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 leading to phosphorylation of TYK2
and JAK1. Activation of TYK2 and JAK1 leads to phosphorylation
of STAT1 and STAT2, which then cause upregulation of interferon-­
stimulated genes (ISGs). There are multiple potential defects along
this pathway that can lead to viral susceptibility. The role of this pathway has been highlighted with the COVID-­19 pandemic, with not only
genetic defects but also autoantibodies against type I IFNs leading to
more severe disease.
Autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 lead
to a lack of TYK2 phosphorylation for IFNAR1 defects, and both TYK2
and JAK1 phosphorylation for IFNAR2 with subsequent downstream
deficiency of ISG upregulation. Despite the severe in vitro findings, the
viral infection susceptibility appears more limited. Both are rare diseases, with most patients developing severe or fatal illness after live viral
vaccination with the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine (largely
measles component) or yellow fever vaccine. Herpes viral control is variable, with a fatal case of herpes encephalitis reported in IFNAR1 deficiency, and poor control of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) in IFNAR2.
Variants have been described with severe SARS-­CoV-2 infection. These
diseases appear to have incomplete penetrance, with some affected individuals having better control of viral infections or vaccination. Naturally
acquired viral infections have been controlled much more than live viral
vaccinations. These diseases are rare and therapy remains unclear, but
avoiding live viral vaccines, considering antiviral prophylaxis for HSV/
VZV infections, and vaccination of affected individuals and close contacts for influenza and COVID-­19 appears prudent.
Genetic defects in STAT1 can be activating (STAT1 GOF) or can
be heterozygous or recessive with LOF. Autosomal recessive complete
STAT1 deficiency is the most severe defect with most cases being fatal
early in life. As IFN-­α, IFN-­β, and IFN-­γ all signal through STAT1,
completely impaired signaling predisposes individuals to both severe

early-­onset viral disease in addition to disseminated mycobacterial
disease. Herpes family infections are common as well as live viral disseminated infection. The disease is fatal without HSCT early in life, but
HSCT outcomes have been poor with several children having herpes
family inflammatory complications after HSCT, such as with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or severe CMV disease. There
are also patients with autosomal recessive hypomorphic STAT1 pathogenic variants who have some residual STAT1 disease that appears to
have a less severe phenotype. Treatment is with aggressive antimicrobials to treat presenting infections and prevent new infections until
HSCT is performed.
Autosomal recessive complete STAT2 deficiency presenting early in
life with severe viral infections is not as severe as STAT1 deficiency due
to maintenance of IFN-­γ signaling. Compared to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2
deficiency, there is more severe disease with naturally acquired viral
infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and enteroviruses,
but similarly severe disease has been seen with MMR vaccine. Some
children have been described to have a Kawasaki-­like inflammatory
presentation. The phenotype has been variable with some deaths early
in life and some surviving to adulthood. Treatment remains uncertain
with few patients reported, but live viral vaccines should be avoided,
antiviral prophylaxis provided, and influenza vaccination given to
those affected and close contacts.
Autosomal recessive IRF9 deficiency appears to present similarly to
STAT2 deficiency. After IFN-­α or IFN-­β stimulation leads to STAT1
and STAT2 phosphorylation, these STAT proteins can heterodimerize with IRF9 to lead to ISG upregulation. This is a very rare defect
presenting with naturally occurring or vaccine strain viruses. Life-­
threatening influenza and severe enterovirus infections have been
described in addition to vaccine strain varicella and MMR dissemination. Treatment remains uncertain with few patients reported, but live
viral vaccines should be avoided, antiviral prophylaxis considered, and
influenza and COVID-­19 vaccination given to those affected and close
contacts.
Defects have been described in cytosolic sensors of viral DNA or
RNA replication by-­products that lead to fairly specific viral susceptibility. Melanoma differentiation-­associated protein 5 (MDA5),
encoded by the IFIH1 gene, is a cytosolic sensor of double-­stranded
RNA by-­products of RNA viral replication. Several patients have been
described with LOF variants, either autosomal recessive or dominant,
with presumed dominant negative effect, resulting in severe susceptibility to respiratory viruses including rhinovirus and influenza. Retinoic acid-­inducible gene I (RIG-­I), encoded by the DDX58 gene, plays
a similar role, and a patient has been described with LOF variants having severe influenza infection. RNA polymerase III deficiency (POL
III) is a cytosolic DNA sensor detecting replication by-­products of
DNA viruses. AD pathogenic variants have been reported in POL III in
children and adults with severe varicella-­zoster disease causing pneumonitis, encephalitis, and CNS vasculitis. Treatment is not defined,
but avoiding live viral vaccines, providing antiviral prophylaxis, and
providing non-­live annual influenza and COVID-­19 vaccination to
affected individuals and family members appear prudent.
NK functional and quantitative defects can occur on their own or
as part of combined immune deficiencies and are associated with viral
infections (see Chapter 167). Pathogenic variants in the FCGR3A gene,
encoding CD16, which is a Fc receptor on NK cells, impair NK cytotoxicity. A few patients have been described who have susceptibility
to herpes family viruses with EBV-­related disease such as Castleman
disease or HSV and VZV infections. Patients also develop significant
warts from HPV infection. Antiviral prophylaxis should be given to
prevent HSV/VZV infections, in addition to HPV vaccination.

Predominant HSV Encephalitis

Defects that affect TLR3 signaling predispose quite specifically to HSV
encephalitis due to their role in the activation of type 1 IFNs in the
CNS (Fig. 175.2; see Table 175.2). Double-­stranded RNA is detected
by TLR3, which then recruits the adaptor TRIF to activate TRAF3 to
induce IFN-­α, IFN-­β, and inflammatory cytokines through TBK1 and
IRF3 and other proteins. UNC93B1 acts as a transporter protein to

transport TLR3 and other TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum to
the endosome to allow RNA binding. The TLR3 pathway is redundant
for leukocyte immunity, but it is essential for CNS host viral immunity; thus the infection susceptibility of these defects is primarily CNS
HSV disease. The defects in signaling are not found in leukocytes but
required fibroblasts and inducible pluripotent stem cell generation
of CNS cells to demonstrate abnormal IFN-­α responses with HSV
infection.
Pathogenic variants in multiple genes along this pathway have similar presentations with HSV encephalitis including autosomal recessive
and dominant LOF variants in TLR3, dominant pathogenic variants in
TRAF3, dominant and recessive pathogenic variants in TRIF, recessive
pathogenic variants in UNC93B1, and dominant pathogenic variants in
TBK1 and IRF3. The HSV encephalitis tends to present in infancy and
early childhood on HSV exposure, with frontal and temporal lobes predominantly affected. Dominant pathogenic variants in TLR3 have also
been associated with severe influenza and varicella-­zoster encephalitis
in a few adults. Genetic diagnosis is essential as routine immunologic

studies are normal. Treatment is supportive with acyclovir or similar
prophylaxis.
Rarely children can have brainstem CNS infections, including
HSV; defects in the TLR3 pathway have not been found in these cases.
Autosomal recessive hypomorphic pathogenic variants in DBR1 (debranching enzyme 1) have been identified in children with brainstem
encephalitis caused by HSV, norovirus, and influenza virus. DBR1 is an
RNA lariat-­debranching enzyme that degrades spliced RNA introns,
which is ubiquitously expressed in humans but with highest amounts
in the brainstem and peripheral nervous system. With decreased function, there is increased accumulation of lariat introns that presumably
interfere with viral recognition and control. Genetic diagnosis can
allow prophylaxis with antivirals such as acyclovir and influenza vaccination of the affected individual and close contacts.

175.3 Susceptibility to Invasive Bacterial
Infections

Type I Interferons
(e.g. IFNalpha, Beta)

Jenna R.E. Bergerson and Alexandra F. Freeman
Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) with predominant susceptibility
to invasive bacterial infections such as meningitis, sepsis, arthritis,
osteomyelitis, and deep-­seated abscesses are rare, and are mostly due
to neutrophil defects or defects in innate immunity. Inherited disorders of the Toll and IL-­1 receptor (TIR)-­pathway are innate immunity
defects with a very distinct phenotype with invasive pyogenic bacterial
infections and usually the absence of fever and inflammatory markers. TLRs on white blood cell surfaces sense bacterial peptides leading
to activation of the NF-­κB and MAPK pathway leading to inflammatory mediators (Fig. 175.3). IEIs associated with impaired TLR signaling include pathogenic variants in NEMO, IKBA, MyD88, and IRAK4
(Table 175.3).

IRAK4 DEFICIENCY

MYD88 DEFICIENCY

MyD88 deficiency resembles the clinical and laboratory findings in
IRAK4 deficiency (Fig. 175.4; see Table 175.1). These patients have a
susceptibility to serious bacterial infections due primarily to S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa, including an inability to mount
fever at the beginning of infection. CRP does not rise early during infection, likely due to impaired IL-­6 production. Invasive bacterial infections begin before age 2 years and seem to improve with age, although
noninvasive bacterial infections similarly persist after adolescence.
Diagnosis is similar to IRAK4 deficiency relying on genetics, as routine
immunologic testing is nondiagnostic. MyD88-­deficient patients may
have elevated serum IgE and IgG4 concentrations in up to 50% and

Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs)

Fig. 175.2 Defects along type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling lead to viral

susceptibility. Type 1 IFNs bind to their heteroreceptor comprising IFNAR1
and IFNAR2 leading to TYK2 and JAK1 phosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, which then cause upregulation of IFN-­
stimulated genes (ISGs). IRF9 can also heterodimerize with STAT2 leading
to ISG upregulation. Multiple genetic defects along this pathway (marked
with X) can lead to viral susceptibility.

IRAK4 deficiency presents in infancy and early childhood with severe,
recurrent bacterial infections, specifically due to S. pneumoniae, S.
aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Unique to this disorder, clostridial
infections have also been reported. An impairment in mounting a fever
at the beginning of infection with a corresponding rise in CRP are also
hallmark features of this disease. Most patients with IRAK4 deficiency
present with their first bacterial infection before 2 years of age; there is a
high mortality rate in the early years. However, the frequency and severity of infections in IRAK4 deficiency improves with age, with none of the
reported patients having invasive bacterial infections after the onset of
adolescence, even those not on prophylactic antibiotics. Approximately
50% of IRAK4-­deficient patients continue to have noninvasive skin and
upper respiratory infections after adolescence. Delayed separation of the
umbilical cord has been reported in IRAK4-­deficient patients due to an
unclear mechanism.
Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and genetic testing because
other immunologic studies are variable or require research laboratory
testing. All T-­and B-­cell and NK cell subsets are unremarkable, but
there may be a deficiency of unswitched memory B cells with normal
levels of switched memory B cells. Specific antibody levels to pneumococcal and allohemagglutinins of the ABO system are impaired
in up to 30% of patients. Serum IgE and IgG4 concentrations are elevated in up to 65% and 30%, respectively. Defective IL-­6 production
leads to the inability to increase plasma CRP or mount fevers. Without the clinical findings of fever and inflammatory markers, there
may be a low threshold for diagnostic imaging and initiating empiric
parenteral antibiotic treatment against S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and
P. aeruginosa. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be implemented with
agents like clotrimazole plus penicillin, and immunizations against
pneumococcus serotypes, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis
given. If patients have a poor response to vaccination, immunoglobulin replacement should be considered. There is a paucity of data to
support the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis, but given that invasive
pyogenic infections seem to resolve by adolescence a trial discontinuation could be considered at this time. Nonetheless these patients
continue to have skin and upper respiratory infections and may benefit from lifelong antibiotic prophylaxis targeting pyogenic bacteria.

Other inherited disorders of the TIR pathway like IRAK1 deficiency
and TIRAP deficiency will be addressed in Table 175.3.

ISOLATED CONGENITAL ASPLENIA

Asplenia refers to the complete lack of splenic tissue and includes a
heterogenous group of conditions ranging from surgical asplenia to
congenital asplenia. Congenital asplenia can be part of a syndrome of
multiple congenital anomalies (see Chapter 480.11) or, less often, it can
be isolated (see Table 175.3).
A diagnosis of isolated congenital asplenia (ICA) is made on the
basis of the presence of Howell-­Jolly bodies (HJBs) on blood smear
and the lack of a detectable spleen at ultrasound in the absence of
cardiovascular malformations. Some cases are due to an AD inheritance; relatives of those with ICA should be evaluated because the
outcome is typically poor without initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis
and pneumococcal vaccination. Half of all isolated cases are due to
pathogenic variants in RPSA, a protein component of the small ribosomal subunit. Involvement of related key spleen patterning genes
involved during embryogenesis can also result in splenic agenesis.
Presentation is typically with overwhelming, refractory infections
due to encapsulated bacteria, particularly S. pneumoniae, but also other
encapsulated bacteria like H. influenzae and N. meningitidis. Diseases
like malaria and babesiosis also affect asplenic patients more severely
due to defective removal of intra-­erythrocytic parasites. In all cases of
pneumococcal sepsis, a blood smear should be evaluated for HJBs in
addition to an abdominal ultrasound to identify patients with ICA.
Immunization against pneumococcal serotypes and meningococcal
serotypes is essential. Conjugated vaccines are preferred to unconjugated
vaccines. Influenza vaccination should also occur yearly due to the risk
of pneumococcal superinfection. Long-­term oral penicillin prophylaxis
(amoxicillin 10 mg/kg twice daily to max 250 mg OR ≤3 years: penicillin
V 125 mg twice daily, ≥3 years: penicillin 250 mg twice daily) is recommended, as is early initiation of IV antibiotics in the setting of febrile
illnesses. Patient education is a critical part in management. Patients
should recognize and react to fever as a life-­threatening emergency with
initiation of antibiotic therapy at home (pediatric dosage of amoxicillin-­
clavulanate 45 mg/kg twice daily or levofloxacin 10 mg/kg for penicillin

allergic patients) even before seeking medical care. Animal bites (risk
of Capnocytophaga) also should be recognized as a medical emergency
requiring local wound care and debridement, and a short course of antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin-­clavulanate for 3-­5 days). Lastly, when traveling patients should know what to do in case of fever, and if in a tropical
area recognize the increased risk for malaria.

175.4 Mendelian Susceptibility to
Mycobacterial Diseases
Jenna R.E. Bergerson and Alexandra F. Freeman
The group of diseases referred to as mendelian susceptibility to
mycobacterial diseases (MSMDs) centers around the synthesis and
signaling of IFN-­γ required for the ability of macrophages to control intracellular infections including mycobacteria as well as some
other intracellular bacteria, fungi and viruses (see Table 175.1).
Control of mycobacterial infections relies on the IL-­12/IFN-­γ/
STAT1 pathway (see Fig. 175.4). When the macrophages ingest
mycobacteria or other intracellular organisms, they secrete the cytokine IL-­12, which binds to its receptor, a heterodimer comprising
IL-­12RB1 plus IL-­21RB2, on the T lymphocytes and NK cells. This
then leads to the secretion by the T/NK lymphocytes of IFN-­γ. IFN-­
γ binds to its heterodimer receptor, IFN-­γR1 and IFN-­γR2, leading
to JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylation, and then STAT1 phosphorylation. STAT1 is a transcription factor that leads to the upregulation
of IFN-­regulated genes (IRGs), which leads to the clearance of these
infections. Control of mycobacteria relies on this pathway, but also
other intracellular microorganisms such as endemic fungi (e.g., Histoplasma and Coccidioides), Salmonella, leishmaniasis, and, in part,
some viruses, such as those in the herpes virus family.
The MSMD defects typically present with disseminated BCG or with
extrapulmonary nontuberculous and environmental mycobacteria
(NTM); individuals with disseminated mycobacterial disease with either
bone or visceral involvement should be evaluated. Depending on the
type of defect, the infection may be more localized, such as the osteomyelitis seen frequently with dominant LOF defects in IFN-­γR1 or STAT1,

Fig. 175.4 TLR/IL-­1R pathways. MyD88 is a cytosolic adaptor protein that bridges TLRs and IL-­1Rs to the IRAK complex and subsequently allows
for the downstream production of cytokines and interferons (IFNs) through the NF-­κB and MAPK pathways. All TLRs, except TLR3, as well as multiple
IL-­1Rs use MyD88 and IRAK4. Where defects lead to predominant susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections are marked by an X.

or with more disseminated disease often with lymph node, bowel, and
hepatosplenic involvement. Extrapulmonary TB should also raise suspicion of MSMD in young BCG-­vaccinated children. Mycobacterial disease
restricted to the lungs is much less frequently associated with MSMD,
but more often with diseases predisposing to bronchiectasis. In addition,
young children with isolated cervical adenitis from NTM do not usually
have MSMD; the evaluation can be limited to those with recurrent or difficult to treat disease.
Therapy relies on targeted antimicrobials, but cytokine adjuvants,
such as IFN-­γ, and consideration of HSCT varies based on the defect.
Related defects that predispose to CMC are noted in Table 175.4.

IFN-­γR Defects

The IFN-­γ receptor is a heterodimer comprised of IFN-­γR1 and IFN-­
γR2, and defects in both components lead to abnormal signaling. There
are biallelic and heterozygous pathogenic variants that lead to differing
presentations.

Autosomal Recessive Complete IFN-­γR1/IFN-­γR2
Deficiency

The most severe defect of the IFN-­γR defects are homozygous or
compound heterozygous pathogenic variants that block all IFN-­γ
signaling. The variants are in the extracellular domains of the protein and lead to no surface receptor expression. In countries where
BCG is given, these patients typically present in infancy with disseminated BCG; in other countries affected patients present usually
in early childhood with disseminated NTM, such as Mycobacterium
avium complex (MAC). Salmonella and Listeria can also cause severe
infection; there may be more severe disease with common respiratory viruses and herpes family viruses. Diagnosis is with genetic
testing, but some laboratories can also suggest the diagnosis by performing flow cytometry showing no surface expression of the IFNg-­γ

on monocytes or lack of intracellular STAT1 phosphorylation after
stimulation with IFN-­γ.
Treatment of complete IFN-­γR1 deficiency is aggressive antimicrobial therapy until HSCT. Adjuvant IFN-­γ is not helpful because
signaling is blocked; addition of IFN-­α has been used successfully
in some cases of disseminated MAC. These patients usually have
disseminated NTM or BCG and require combination antibiotics
through HSCT, with breakthrough infections being seen often if
antibiotics are withdrawn. High serum IFN-­γ levels in the blood are
typical when infection is present and has been correlated with a poor
HSCT outcome; these levels can be followed and HSCT optimally
performed when they decline.

Autosomal Dominant IFN-­γR1 Deficiency

Compared with complete γ/2 deficiency, AD IFN-­γR1 deficiency allows
partial IFNg signaling, and thus a typically less severe clinical course.
Most pathogenic variants are small frameshift deletions in the intracellular domain of the IFNGR1 gene, thus blocking both the JAK binding site
as well as the receptor recycling domain, eliminating the removal of the
nonfunctional receptor from the cell surface. Clinical presentation is usually later in childhood or adolescence with more focal NTM infections,
which is usually osteomyelitis. BCG can present with osteomyelitis as well,
at a younger age than is usually seen for the environmental NTM. Disseminated endemic fungi infections with Histoplasma and Coccidioides are
seen, in addition to disseminated Salmonella infections. Diagnosis relies
on genetic testing, but in laboratories able to perform flow cytometry for
IFN-­γR expression, diagnosis is suspected by increased IFN-­γR expression
due to the inability to recycle the receptor. Intracellular STAT1 phosphorylation is reduced after IFN-­γ stimulation, although not absent such as with
the complete defects.
Treatment involves antimicrobials guided by the specific infection, with
combination antibiotics needed for NTM/BCG. The addition of IFN-­γ is

often helpful to clear the infection because some IFN-­γ signaling remains.
After clearance of the infection, lifelong prophylaxis is suggested such as
with azithromycin therapy, and consideration of fluconazole for Coccidioides endemic regions. IFN-­γ is not usually long term for prophylaxis. HSCT
has been performed in rare cases but is typically not considered necessary.

Autosomal Recessive IL-­12 Receptor Beta 1 (IL-­
12RB1) Deficiency

Biallelic typically missense or nonsense pathogenic variants in IL-­
12RB1 result in complete loss of IL-­12 signaling leading to disseminated
NTM or other intracellular infections. Compared with complete IFN-­
γR deficiency, the penetration and expressivity of IL-­12RB1 deficiency
is much more variable. Some patients are asymptomatic, even if BCG
is given, whereas others develop severe disease early in life with early
mortality; even within families the disease can have very different presentations. This defect is also more common than IFN-­γR deficiency.
Disseminated BCG is common in countries in which the vaccine is
given and disseminated environmental NTM presents at much more
variable ages in other countries. Although there is increased childhood
mortality from this defect, patients who clear disseminated BCG infection have lower rates of subsequent NTM infection than those who did
not have a BCG infection. Disseminated Salmonella is seen frequently.
IL-­12RB1 forms a heterodimer with IL-­23R, so perturbation of this
signaling cascade also results in an increased rate of mucocutaneous
candidiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed with genetic testing, but some laboratories can test the lymphocyte response to IL-­12 signaling, noting
absence of STAT4 phosphorylation or IFN-­γ secretion.
Treatment is aimed at antimicrobials for the diagnosed infection.
Secondary prophylaxis is suggested after clearance of mycobacterial
infections, such as with azithromycin. Adjuvant IFN-­γ therapy has
been used in cases where antimicrobials do not adequately clear the
infection. Increased doses than are used in CGD may be needed, with
prudence being to titrate up the dose slowly as hyperinflammatory presentations can complicate the therapy. There is very little experience
with HSCT in IL-­12RB1 deficiency.

AD STAT1 Loss of Function

Although GOF and complete LOF STAT1 defects can be associated
with NTM infections, NTM infections occur with the highest frequency in AD STAT1 LOF, which is to be expected because STAT1 is
downstream of the IL-­12/IFN-­γ pathway. Presentation is typically with

more focal NTM or BCG infections, often with osteomyelitis, similar
to that seen with AD IFN-­γR1 deficiency. Diagnosis requires genetic
testing. Patients typically respond well to combination antimicrobials
and can then be placed on long-­term prophylaxis. Infants with complete STAT1 deficiency have had disseminated BCG; this defect also
has severe viral infections.

TYK2 Deficiency

JAK proteins and TYK2 are part of the JAK/STAT signal transduction
pathway. TYK2 is downstream of IFN-­α and -­β, as well as IL-­12/IL-­
23, with its activation leading to STAT1 phosphorylation. Patients have
had disseminated BCG, TB, and viral infections.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS FOR MSMD

MSMD centers around the control of intracellular organisms including
Mycobacteria by the lymphocyte/macrophage interactions involving
the IL-­12/IFN-­γ/STAT1 pathway. However, other primary and secondary immune deficiencies should be included in the differential diagnosis of those presenting with disseminated NTM. Disseminated NTM
is a common infection for those with GATA2 deficiency, which typically presents in adolescence or adulthood, and is often associated with
monocytopenia and myelodysplasia, susceptibility to HPV, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Nuclear factor-­κ-­B (NEMO) deficiency and
other genetic defects involved in NF-­κB activation, such as defects in
IkBα, are combined immune deficiencies that present with recurrent
bacterial, viral, and disseminated mycobacterial disease; NEMO and
IKBα may both have ectodermal dysplasia as part of the phenotype.
Disseminated NTM is a less frequent complication for other myeloid
and lymphocyte IEIs such as CGD, NFKB1 deficiency, and severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). Disseminated NTM is also associated with autoantibodies against IFN-­γ; these should be considered
for adult-­onset disease. In the United States, anti–IFN-­γ autoantibody
disease with disseminated NTM is much more common in Asian
females but is seen in males and females in East Asian countries. HIV/
AIDS should always be ruled out for those with disseminated NTM.
Disseminated NTM can also be seen secondary to immune suppressive medications, with TNF-­α blockade being the most common cause.
Hairy cell leukemia has an increased incidence of disseminated NTM.

GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION AND
MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

Whenever possible, precautionary measures to reduce or minimize
exposure to infection should be implemented. Whereas patients with
severe immunologic defects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency
[SCID]) would benefit from strict isolation, patients with other, less
severe types of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) usually do
not require such restrictive measures. It is imperative to maximize the
patient’s quality of life while implementing appropriate infection mitigation strategies. Using shared decision-­making, the clinician, patient,
and caregivers should regularly discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of infection mitigation strategies, as the patient’s clinical situation
and risk change over time. Universal precautions, including but not
limited to proper and thorough hand hygiene, should be frequently
practiced by patients as well as their close contacts. The use of masks
that cover the nose and mouth should be considered to avoid infection,
especially when highly transmissible infections (e.g., SARS-­CoV-­2)
are prevalent in the community. This is especially important in those
PID patients before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) while
on immunosuppressive medications and afterward while awaiting
immune reconstitution. There is a low threshold to do further diagnostic
testing to identify acute infections early and to start antimicrobial therapy or admit the patient to hospital for aggressive treatment if needed.
It is also important to practice standard routine oral hygiene. Guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures in PID
patients has not been well established. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with PIDs requiring invasive dental procedures
such as root canals and tooth extraction. In particular, those patients
with PID with ongoing odontogenic infections require antibiotics
before and during dental treatment. There is not enough evidence for
antibiotic prophylaxis for noninvasive dental procedures such as oral
examinations.

IMMUNIZATIONS

Some PID patients will not mount an adequate immune response to
vaccinations because of their underlying immunologic defect. Nonetheless, immunizations should be given to prevent infections to PID
patients who are able to respond to vaccination. Specific immunization
practices are covered in Chapter 215. Immunization with live viral or
bacterial vaccines (BCG) is contraindicated in many PIDs due to the
risk of acquiring the live vaccine–related disease. Specific recommendations for vaccines in PID are shown in Table 176.1.
Patients who are on immunoglobulin G (IgG) replacement therapy
(IgRT) do not require routine vaccinations because they receive passive
immunization. Protective levels of antibodies against tetanus toxoid,
diphtheria toxoid, measles, varicella, pertussis, pneumococci, and three
meningococcal serotypes are documented in patients receiving IgRT.

GUIDANCE FOR CLOSE CONTACTS

Household members and other close contacts should not receive live
oral polio virus or live influenza vaccine because they may shed the
virus and transmit infection. Household members should generally
be vaccinated to all recommended vaccines, including MMR and

varicella, to facilitate herd immunity. Transmission of MMR vaccine
viruses has not been reported. The risk of transmission of varicella vaccine virus from a healthy person to an immunocompromised person is
rare. If a close contact develops varicella rash after immunization with
the varicella or zoster vaccines, isolation of the patient and administration of varicella-­zoster immune globulin is recommended.

COVID-­19 VACCINE

The impact and severity of SARS-­
CoV-­
2 infection likely varies
depending on the underlying immune defect. Small case series have
suggested that B-­cell lymphopenia (such as in X-­linked agammaglobulinemia [XLA]) may actually be a protective factor and correlates with
milder COVID-­19 course. Meanwhile, patients with biallelic loss-­of-­
function variants in AIRE, who have autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type-­1 (APS-­1), appear to have higher risk for life-­threatening
COVID-­19 pneumonia due to the presence of autoantibodies to type
I interferons (IFNs). Although all PID patients will benefit from infection prevention and mitigation practices, it is becoming apparent that
morbidity and mortality is variable among PID patients.
The most effective COVID prevention practices include the standard infection prevention strategies for all diseases including frequent
handwashing, minimizing exposure to sick contacts, self-­isolation/
quarantining while ill, and mask wearing when in crowded public areas
or areas with suboptimal ventilation. The most effective prevention
strategy against COVID-­19 is vaccination. Although this is a rapidly
changing situation, a variety of organizations have created recommendations for immunodeficiency patients. The consensus is that PID
patients should be vaccinated with non-­live vaccines based on what
has been approved for the age-­group in their country. Patients with
humoral deficiencies who do not respond with measurable antibody
titers should still be considered for vaccination as vaccines can induce
cellular immunity as well.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends administration of a third or fourth dose in
high-­risk patients, such as immunocompromised patients, including
PID patients with moderate to severe immunodeficiency and patients
on chronic immunosuppressive therapy.

PROPHYLAXIS
Antimicrobial Prophylaxis

Prophylactic antibiotics are one of the mainstays for infection prevention in patients with PID. The specific antimicrobial prophylaxis recommended differs depending on the type of PID because patients with
different PIDs are susceptible to different pathogens.

IMMUNODEFICIENCIES AFFECTING CELLULAR
AND HUMORAL IMMUNITY
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency

Patients with SCID will require definitive treatment with allogeneic
HSCT to correct the immune defect. It is crucial that patients remain
infection free to maximize chances of long-­term survival. With the
implementation of newborn screening for SCID, infants with SCID are
being detected before they develop infections. When SCID is suspected,
the number of people in contact with the infant should be limited. Due
to risk of transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) through breast milk,
many PID transplant centers recommend cessation of breastfeeding
until the CMV status of both the mother and infant is established.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be directed toward pneumonia
caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci with a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. However, in infants under 2 months of age,
there is a concern for bilirubin displacement from albumin and subsequent risk of kernicterus. In these young infants, close monitoring
of bilirubin levels is recommended or alternatives such as atovaquone,
dapsone, and pentamidine can be considered. Fluconazole to prevent
mucocutaneous candidiasis and acyclovir for viral prophylaxis can
be considered as well. In countries where BCG vaccine is commonly
administered in early infancy, daily chemoprophylaxis until definitive
treatment with HSCT and immune reconstitution is needed with isoniazid and rifampin due to the risk of disseminated BCG infection.

Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), can be considered for children under 2 years of
age with SCID during the RSV season to prevent serious disease. The
specific RSV seasonal patterns differ between countries.

HYPER-­IgM/CD40LG DEFICIENCY

Patients with hyper-­IgM or CD40LG deficiency are especially susceptible to P. jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and require prophylaxis with a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. These patients are
also at special risk for developing sclerosing cholangitis, which can be
associated with Cryptosporidium parvum infection. To prevent the risk
of cryptosporidium infection, steps need to be taken to avoid drinking
contaminated water and places where risk of infection is higher, such
as at recreational water parks.

COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCIES WITH
ASSOCIATED OR SYNDROME FEATURES
DiGeorge Syndrome/22q11 Deletion Syndrome

Most patients with DiGeorge syndrome do not require antimicrobial
prophylaxis as most patients do not have severe immunodeficiency
(i.e., partial DiGeorge syndrome). Less than 1% of patients have significant thymic aplasia and profound T-­and B-­cell lymphopenia (i.e.,
complete DiGeorge syndrome), putting them at risk of PJP and CMV;
PJP prophylaxis is recommended.

Wiskott-­Aldrich Syndrome

Patients with Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome (WAS) are susceptible to
a variety of viral and bacterial infections. Prophylactic antimicrobials
against infection by PJP and herpes simplex virus are often recommended.
If splenectomy is necessary for severe refractory thrombocytopenia,
those patients would then require penicillin prophylaxis to protect
against infection by encapsulated organisms.

Ataxia Telangiectasia

Opportunistic infections in patients with ataxia telangiectasia are
infrequent; however, sinopulmonary infections are common. Prophylactic azithromycin is commonly used empirically, however, efficacy
data are sparse.

STAT3 HYPER-­IgE SYNDROME (JOB SYNDROME)

These patients are susceptible to skin infections predominantly with
Staphylococcus aureus causing “cold” abscesses with diminished inflammatory response. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis occurs in over
70% of patients. Pneumonia is a frequent infection with risk of leading to bronchiectasis and pneumatoceles. Common causative pathogens
include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and fungal organisms such as Aspergillus and P. jiroveci. Antimicrobial
prophylaxis with a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
and antifungal medications such as itraconazole is recommended.

NF-­κB ESSENTIAL MODULATOR (NEMO)
DEFICIENCY

Patients with NF-­κB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency are susceptible to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), similar to patients
with IFN-­γ and interleukin (IL)-­12 defects. Prophylaxis with azithromycin should be considered. However, these patients are also at risk for
many bacterial infections, viral infections such as herpesviruses, and
opportunistic infections such as PJP. Acyclovir for viral prophylaxis and
a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for PJP prophylaxis should be considered as well.

PREDOMINANTLY ANTIBODY DEFICIENCIES
Hypogammaglobinemias

Lifelong IgRT is the mainstay of infection prevention for patients with
major antibody deficiencies such as agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Prophylactic antibiotics can
be used in conjunction with IgRT for patients who develop recurrent
respiratory tract infections, which can lead to severe complications of
bronchiectasis. Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin are commonly used for prophylaxis due to their anti-­inflammatory properties
in chronic lung disease. Low-­dose oral azithromycin reduces the number of exacerbation episodes per patient-­year, with a consequent reduction in additional courses of antibiotics and risk of hospitalization.

Other Antibody Deficiencies

Patients with minor antibody deficiencies such as transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI), selective IgA deficiency, IgG

1346 Part XII u Immunology
subclass deficiency, or specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins can usually be managed without need for IgRT. Patients
who experience chronic or recurrent infections may benefit from
prophylactic antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics and IgRT are equally
effective as first-­line treatment in preventing infections in specific antibody deficiency patients.

(3) normal immunoglobulin levels with impaired specific antibody
production, (4) hypogammaglobulinemia with normal antibody function, (5) isolated IgG subclass deficiency with normal immunoglobulin
levels and normal quality antibody responses, and (6) recurrent infections related to an unknown immune mechanism.

CONGENITAL PHAGOCYTE DEFECTS
Chronic Granulomatous Disease

IgRT reduces both acute and chronic infections in this patient population; the number and severity of infectious complications are inversely
correlated with IgRT dose. When IgG trough levels are maintained
above 800 mg/dL, serious bacterial illness and enteroviral meningoencephalitis are prevented; increasing trough levels up to 1,000 mg/
dL are associated with decreased risk for pneumonia. In the setting of
SCID, IgRT is warranted at diagnosis because maternally derived IgG
wanes after birth, during the posttransplant period, or gene therapy
or enzyme replacement (for adenosine deaminase [ADA] deficiency)
until B-­cell function reconstitution, or indefinitely if B-­cell function is
not restored.

Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are susceptible
to severe bacterial and fungal infections. The most common bacterial
organisms include S. aureus, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia, and Nocardia species. The majority of fungal infections in CGD
are attributed to Aspergillus species causing invasive aspergillosis. Prophylaxis with a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and
itraconazole is recommended.

Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency

Antibiotic prophylaxis to protect against infections with S. aureus or
gram-­negative bacilli is recommended.

DEFECTS IN INTRINSIC AND INNATE IMMUNITY
Interferon-­γ/IL-­12 Pathway Defects

Patients with IFN-­γ/IL-­12 pathway defects are at special risk for infections with intracellular pathogens such as nontuberculosis Mycobacterium species as well as Salmonella. Prophylaxis with daily azithromycin
or clarithromycin is recommended.

COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCIES

Deficiency of terminal pathway components can lead to recurrent neisserial infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin can be considered. Immunization against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria
meningitidis is strongly recommended.

IMMUNOGLOBULIN G REPLACEMENT THERAPY

Human immunoglobulin preparations, derived from the plasma of
paid donors, can be administered intravenously (IVIG), subcutaneously (SCIG), or intramuscularly (IMIG) to treat a variety of disorders,
including inborn errors of immunity, acquired immunodeficiency, and
autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. IgRT provides passive immunity through preformed antibodies against a wide range of pathogens
that are encountered by the general population, leading to immediate
but transient protection; IgRT has an integral role in the treatment of
patients with defects in the humoral immune system. IgRT is also used
for a variety of medical conditions because of its anti-­inflammatory
and immunomodulating effects.

Products

Although most products are approved for a specific administration
route, several 10% IVIG solutions can be administered subcutaneously
with good patient tolerability. More concentrated 20% SCIG and 16%
IMIG products should not be used intravenously. Available products
and their key properties are summarized in Table 176.2. IMIG is rarely
used because of its inferior safety and tolerability profile. Injections are
painful, the injectable volume is limited, and the risk of local injury and
adverse reactions is higher. Both IVIG and SCIG products are effective
in treating humoral immunodeficiencies, without significant differences
in the infection rates between the two routes. Incidence of infection is
inversely correlated with dose regardless of route.

INDICATIONS FOR IgRT

IgRT is indicated for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies characterized by absent or deficient antibody production, which
comprises the majority of PIDs. The utility of IgRT in decreasing the
frequency and severity of infection is well accepted for agammaglobulinemia (e.g., XLA) and hypogammaglobulinemia (e.g., CVID). There
are six distinct phenotypes of primary immunodeficiency for which
IgRT is or may be indicated: (1) agammaglobulinemia due to absence
of B cells, (2) hypogammaglobulinemia with poor antibody function,

Agammaglobulinemia Due to Absence of B cells

Hypogammaglobulinemia with Poor Antibody
Function

Patients with recurrent infections who demonstrate decreased immunoglobulin concentrations and/or impaired response to protein and/or
polysaccharide vaccines benefit from IgRT. CVID falls in this category.
Initiation of IgRT is associated with decreased infection rate compared
with pretreatment. Adequate IgRT dosing is associated with decreased
frequency of sinopulmonary infections, which can mitigate the development of lung inflammation, bronchiectasis, and chronic lung disease. Growing evidence and expert consensus support individualizing
IgRT dosing to keep the patient relatively infection free, achieving a
“biologic trough or biologic steady-­state level,” and following clinical
outcomes rather than using a standardized dose in all patients by disease. In addition to CVID, patients with class-­switching defects, such
as autosomal recessive and X-­linked hyper-­IgM syndromes, also demonstrate decreased infection rates from a variety of pathogens.

NORMAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN LEVELS WITH
IMPAIRED SPECIFIC ANTIBODY PRODUCTION

Determining whether and when IgRT is indicated for these patients
can be challenging. Available evidence and expert consensus suggest
that IgRT should be given when there is well-­documented nonresponsiveness to polysaccharide vaccines and recurrent infections that are
inadequately managed by antibiotic prophylaxis. Protective concentration of antibody to polysaccharide antigens is considered 1.3 μg/mL
and conversion from nonprotective to protective titers. In children 2-­5
years, >50% of concentrations tested are considered protective, with an
observed increase of at least twofold postvaccination, while the threshold is >70% in patients aged 6-­65 years. Selective antibody deficiency
has been categorized into four phenotypes—mild, moderate, severe, and
memory (where the patient can mount an adequate initial response
that wanes within 6 months). If an IgRT trial is started, it should be
discontinued after a period of time so that antibody responses can be
reevaluated a minimum of 3 months after discontinuation. Some children can demonstrate clinical improvement and improved response
after pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine challenge after a short
trial of IgRT, whereas others continue to have recurrent infections and
restart IgRT.

Hypogammaglobulinemia with Normal Antibody
Function

Age-­specific normal ranges differ among laboratories and having IgG
levels below the lower limit of normal for age without accompanying
infections may not be clinically significant. The IgG levels of children
experiencing THI normalize with time. THI may be exacerbated by preterm birth. In the absence of significant infections, IgRT is not routinely
recommended for these children. Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia
arising from medication (e.g., seizure medications, B-­cell depletion
therapy) can also fall in this category. Severe hypogammaglobulinemia,
conventionally defined as IgG levels ≤150 mg/day, is considered a risk

factor for infection, and empiric trial of IgRT is reasonable. However,
patients with levels between 150 and 250 mg/dL deserve further consideration of antibody function and individual clinical history.

Isolated IgG Subclass Deficiency with Normal
Immunoglobulin Levels and Normal Quality Antibody
Responses

Most patients with subclass deficiency are asymptomatic, but a few may
have recurrent infections and poor antibody responses to specific antigens. First-­line management includes prophylactic antibiotics and treatment of other comorbidities, such as allergic rhinitis, that can contribute
to the development of sinopulmonary infections. IgRT is not routinely
recommended for these patients; some case studies have demonstrated
reduced infection rate, decreased antibiotic use, and improved quality
of life among patients on therapy.

Table 176.3  Guiding Principles for Effective Use of IgRT
for Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency
GUIDING PRINCIPLE

IgG is indicated as replacement therapy for
patients with PI characterized by absent
or deficient antibody production; PI is an
FDA-­approved indication for IgRT

Diagnoses

A large number of PI diagnoses exist for
which IgRT is indicated and recommended;
many diagnoses have low total IgG
levels, but some have a normal level with
documented specific antibody deficiency

Frequency of IgRT

Treatment is indicated as ongoing
replacement therapy for PI; treatment
should not be interrupted once a
definitive diagnosis has been established

Dose

IVIG is indicated for PI patients at a starting
dose of 400-­600 mg/kg every 3-­4 wk;
SCIG is generally used at a starting dose
of 100-­200 mg/kg/wk; SCIG dosing
frequency is flexible

IgG trough levels

IgG trough levels can be useful in some
diagnoses to guide care but should not
be a consideration in access to IgRT

Site of care

The decision to infuse IgRT in a hospital,
outpatient infusion center, community
office, or home-­based setting must be
based on patient clinical characteristics

Route

Administration route must be based on
patient characteristics; throughout life,
certain patients may be more appropriate
for IV or SC therapy depending on many
factors, and patients should have access
to either route as needed

Product

IVIG/SCIG are not generic drugs and
products are not interchangeable; a
specific product needs to be matched to
patient characteristics to ensure patient
safety; product change should only occur
with active participation of the prescribing
physician

INDIVIDUALIZING IgRT

Clinicians, patients, and caregivers need to consider each patient’s specific clinical situation and comorbidities, incorporate patient and caregiver preferences, and consider flexibility in dosing route and frequency.
Children and adolescents may object to the multiple and more frequent
needlesticks associated with SCIG. Once the decision is made to start
IgRT, the clinician, patient, and caregivers need to periodically reassess
and adjust as needed. Available IgRT products differ from one another
and are not interchangeable; the product used should be matched carefully to the patient characteristics to maximize patient safety. There are
eight guiding principles on the safe, effective, and appropriate use of
IgRT in patients with primary immunodeficiency (Table 176.3).

CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRODUCT SELECTIONS
IVIG
IgA Content

The amount of IgA in various products varies. Rarely, severe allergic
reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients with
IgE anti-­IgA or IgG anti-­IgA. In these cases, use of low IgA-­containing
IVIG products or SCIG, which appears to be tolerated by these patients
despite having higher IgA content, is recommended. Anaphylaxis due
to IgA in SCIG has not been reported.

Adverse Reactions

All IgRT products are associated with a potential risk for adverse reactions, but historically IVIG is associated with higher risk. Most IVIG
adverse reactions are rate related, mild, and occur in 5–15% of infusions. Slowing or stopping the infusion for 15-­30 minutes usually leads
to complete resolution. Premedication regimens can also help. Ensuring adequate hydration or switching to SCIG has been used successfully
to mitigate this risk. Risk factors for experiencing adverse reactions
include (1) having IVIG for the first time, (2) having or recently having a bacterial infection, (3) having underlying chronic inflammation,
(4) using higher concentration products, (5) using lyophilized product, and (6) fast infusion rates. Future reactions become less likely after
subsequent infusions with the same product. However, patients can
develop adverse reactions at any point even to products they have tolerated previously; clinicians and patients need to remain vigilant. For
enhanced safety, patients who have experienced prior adverse reactions
may benefit from getting infusions at a medical facility, instead of at
home with an infusion nurse.
Serious adverse events, including acute renal failure, neurodegeneration, and thromboembolic events, can occur during or soon after
infusion. Thromboembolic events such as myocardial infarction,

Recurrent Infections Related to an Unknown Immune
Mechanism

There are defined immunodeficiencies, such as ataxia telangiectasia, WAS,
and STAT3 deficiency, as well as syndromic immunodeficiencies, such as
Jacobsen syndrome, which can present with variable humoral immune
defects. IgRT can prevent infections in select patients, and the decision
to start IgRT and dosing considerations should be tailored to individual
needs.

stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism are rare,
but they need to be watched for and require timely intervention
when they occur. Risk factors include preexisting cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, sepsis, increased blood viscosity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. The use of indwelling
venous catheters solely for IVIG administration is not recommended
due to the increased risk for thromboembolism and infection with
these devices.

SCIG
Products

Available products range from 10–20% concentration and offer much
dosing flexibility for patients. Facilitated SCIG (fSCIG) involves recombinant human hyaluronidase to facilitate the SC administration of large
volumes of IgG among multiple sites and a variety of dosing schedules.
Many studies demonstrate equivalence and noninferiority of SCIG and
IVIG for management of PIDs.

Adverse Reactions

SCIG is well tolerated by many patients, including children and IgA-­
deficient patients, and its safety profile is well documented. The most
common adverse reaction is local infusion site reactions that can range
from mild to severe, but severe local reactions are rare. The prevalence
of these local site reactions appears to diminish when infusions are
continued. Carefully cleaning the skin of the infusion site with alcohol
and using appropriately sized infusion needles or catheters can further
decrease risk of local reactions. IV administration of 10% products that
are approved for both IV and SC administration is unlikely to be problematic, but 20% products should not be used intravenously. Premedication is usually not needed for SCIG, but pretreatment of the infusion
site with local anesthetic creams may improve tolerability in children.
In the United States, patients are routinely provided epinephrine
autoinjectors as part of an anaphylaxis kit for home infusions, regardless of prior history of allergic reactions to IgRT.

DOSING CONSIDERATIONS

The IgRT dose that keeps a patient relatively infection free varies between patients and can vary in the same patient over time, so
the goal of IgRT should be to maximize clinical outcomes and not to
achieve a specific IgG level.

traditional SCIG, a four-­dose/7-­week “ramp-­up” period is recommended when starting fSCIG, even in patients who have used other
IgRT products successfully. Once established on therapy, fSCIG infusion rates can be increased as tolerated by the patient from 50 mL/hr up
to 300 mL/hr. The IgG is infused via peristaltic pump or large volume
battery-­operated pump, similar to IVIG, which has been programmed
to account for the higher pressure of fSCIG compared with IV.

ADMINISTRATION DETAILS
Premedication

Many patients tolerate IVIG infusions without premedication. Pediatric pretreatment regimens include oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen,
oral or IV or IM diphenhydramine, or alternatively a nonsedating
antihistamine and/or a glucocorticoid such as oral prednisolone or
IV hydrocortisone. Maintaining adequate hydration before infusion
orally or via IV fluids with normal saline may be beneficial, especially
for patients with preexisting renal disease or other risk factors (e.g.,
concomitant use of nephrotoxic agents). Premedication is usually not
required for SCIG.

VACCINATION WHILE ON IgRT

For traditional SCIG, a starting dose of 100-­200 mg/kg of body weight
per week is commonly used. For hyaluronidase fSCIG, a starting dose
of 400-­600 mg/kg via one or two sites every 3-­4 weeks is common. When
fSCIG is given every 3-­4 weeks, the initial peak will still be lower than
that of IVIG given at the same intervals, but the trough serum levels
will be similar. Patients have more dosing frequency flexibility because
there are products approved for daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly dosing. Infusion rates generally range from 10-­35 mL/hr per site by pump
with volumes of 15-­40 mL per site. The number of sites depends on
the total volume for the target dose, and typical infusion sites include
abdomen, outer thigh, upper arm, and buttocks. Manual rapid-­push
protocols that do not require infusion pumps have been reported to be
safe and tolerable by patients in small nonrandomized trials. Steady-­
state serum IgG levels should be monitored periodically after approximately 3 months and can be used to assess patient adherence.

Administration of IgRT may interfere with vaccination efficacy because
the antibodies in the product might bind to the antigens in the vaccine
and inhibit the immune response. The IgG in the IgRT product may
hinder the viral replication that is needed to induce the desired immune
response in live-­virus vaccines such MMR or varicella (varicella-­zoster
virus [VZV]). Antibody-­containing blood products from the United
States do not interfere with the immune response to yellow fever vaccine and are not believed to interfere with the response to live typhoid,
live-­attenuated influenza, rotavirus, or zoster vaccines. The duration
of inhibition ranges from 3-­11 months and is related to the amount of
antigen-­specific antibody contained in the immune globulin or blood
product. For patients on IgRT, 8 months since last IVIG infusion is the
suggested waiting time before administering live vaccines. Although
no specific recommended waiting time has been suggested for SCIG,
many clinicians will also wait for 8 months since last infusion.
• If the antibody-­containing product is administered before the vaccine is scheduled, the vaccine should be delayed for the suggested
interval. If a dose of MMR or VZV vaccine is administered after an
antibody-­containing product but at an interval shorter than the suggested interval, the vaccine dose should be repeated at the suggested
interval unless an antibody response to the vaccine is documented.
• If the antibody-­containing product is necessary within 14 days after
administration of MMR or VZV vaccine, the vaccine dose should be
repeated after the suggested interval, unless an antibody response to
the vaccine is documented.
Caution is advised when checking and interpreting IgG-­based serologies while on IgRT. Stopping IgRT to assess vaccine efficacy in immunodeficient patients is generally not recommended. Neoantigen vaccines
such as Salmonella typhi Vi can be used to assess a patient’s ability to
make specific antibodies while on IgRT, but this is not widely available.
Annual inactivated influenza vaccine is generally recommended
for immunodeficient patients, including those on IgRT, presumably to
stimulate T-cell immunity, although data are lacking that demonstrate
induction of protective antibodies. The influenza vaccine may be given
simultaneously or at any time interval before or after IgRT infusion.
Clinical trials using gene therapy with retroviral vectors have been
conducted for several inborn errors of immunity including ADA-­
SCID, X-­linked SCID, X-­linked CGD, and WAS in which immunity
was restored but with leukoproliferative complications due to insertion
of the vector into oncogenes, in all except for ADA-­SCID. The use of
lentiviral vectors represented a breakthrough in the field with clinical
recovery and immune reconstitution while minimizing vector-­related
complications. For further details on HSCT and gene therapy/editing,
see Chapters 177 and 178.

Conversion from IVIG to SCIG

The bioavailability of SCIG is approximately 67% lower compared to
IVIG. Thus the monthly dose of SCIG required to achieve an equivalent
monthly area under the curve (AUC) is 1.37 times the IVIG dose for 16%
products and 1.53 for 20% products. No significant differences in infection incidence or outcome have been shown between studies that do not
utilize this dose adjustment compared to studies with this dose adjustment. In clinical practice, AUC dose adjustment is rarely used.

IVIG Dosing

For IVIG, many clinical immunologists use 400-­600 mg/kg every 3-­4
weeks as an acceptable starting point for maintenance therapy, while
continuing to check annual trough levels. Infusion rates start slowly
(e.g., 0.01 mL/kg/min) to minimize adverse reactions, and the rate can
be increased as tolerated. Clinicians should monitor weight changes and
adjust dosing accordingly. Also, IgG levels may need to be checked more
frequently if the patient experiences breakthrough infections, develops new medical conditions (e.g., protein losing conditions), or is not
responding to treatment as expected. Because pharmacokinetics also differs among patients, a specific IVIG dose can result in different trough
levels in patients with similar body mass. There is insufficient evidence
to routinely recommend higher loading IVIG doses in patients with low
IgG levels at presentation; this practice has been associated with higher
risk for adverse reactions at IgRT start. There is limited data on optimal
dosing intervals for IVIG, and current practices vary widely.

SCIG Dosing

The dosing of hyaluronidase fSCIG is similar to IVIG. In the United
States, fSCIG is approved for use in patients 2 years or older. Unlike

Section 6

Hematopoietic Stem
Cell Transplantation
Chapter 177

Principles and
Clinical Indications of
Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation
Rachel A. Phelan and David Margolis
Allogeneic (from a donor) or autologous (from the same individual)
hematopoietic stem cells have been used to cure both malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Autologous transplantation is employed as a rescue
strategy after delivering otherwise lethal doses of chemotherapy with or
without radiotherapy in children with hematologic malignancies such as
relapsed lymphoma or selected solid tumors (e.g., neuroblastoma, brain
tumors). Allogeneic transplantation is used to treat children with genetic
diseases of blood cells, such as hemoglobinopathies, primary immunodeficiency diseases, various inherited metabolic diseases, and bone marrow
failure. Allogeneic transplant is also used as treatment for hematologic
malignancies, such as leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Bone
marrow had originally represented the only source of hematopoietic
progenitor cells. Growth factor (granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor)–
mobilized peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells and umbilical cord
blood hematopoietic progenitors have also been regularly used in clinical
practice to perform hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
A human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-­matched sibling was traditionally the only type of donor employed. Matched unrelated volunteers,
full-­haplotype mismatched family members, and unrelated cord blood
donors have been largely utilized to transplant patients lacking an
HLA-­identical relative.
Protocols for allogeneic HSCT consist of two parts: the preparative
regimen and transplantation itself. During the preparative conditioning regimen, chemotherapy, at times in conjunction with irradiation, is
administered to eliminate the patient’s hematopoietic system and to suppress the immune system, especially T cells, so that graft rejection is prevented. In patients with malignancies, the preparative regimen also serves
to significantly reduce the tumor burden. The patient then receives an
intravenous infusion of hematopoietic cells from the donor. Less aggressive conditioning regimens, known as reduced-­intensity conditioning
regimens, are also used in pediatric patients. These regimens are mainly
immunosuppressive and aim at inducing a state of reduced immune competence of the recipient to avoid the rejection of donor cells.
The immunology of HSCT is distinct from that of other types of
transplant because, in addition to stem cells, the graft contains mature
blood cells of donor origin, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells,
and dendritic cells. These cells repopulate the recipient’s lymphohematopoietic system and give rise to a new immune system, which helps
eliminate residual leukemia cells that survive the conditioning regimen. This effect is known as the graft-­versus-­leukemia (GVL) effect.
The donor immune system exerts its T-­cell–mediated GVL effect
through alloreactions directed against histocompatibility antigens displayed on recipient leukemia cells. However, because some
of these histocompatibility antigens are also displayed on tissues,
unwanted T-­cell–mediated alloreactions may ensue. Specifically, donor

alloreactive immune cells may attack recipient tissues, particularly the
skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and liver, causing acute or chronic
graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD), a condition of varying severity
that in some cases can be life-­threatening or even fatal (see Chapter
179).
The success of allogeneic HSCT is undermined by diversity between
donors and recipients in major and minor histocompatibility antigens.
HLA, including HLA-­A, HLA-­B, and HLA-­C major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I molecules, present peptides to CD8+ T cells,
whereas the HLA-­DR, HLA-­DQ, and HLA-­DP MHC class II molecules
present peptides to CD4+ T cells. There are hundreds of variant forms
of each class I and class II molecule, and even small differences can
elicit alloreactive T-­cell responses that mediate graft rejection and/or
GVHD. Disparities for HLA-­A, HLA-­B, HLA-­C, or HLA-­DRB1 alleles
in the donor-­recipient pair are independent risk factors for both acute
and chronic GVHD. There is also increasing evidence that HLA-­DQ
and HLA-­DP may play a role, prompting some transplant centers to
also explore matching at these alleles.
Minor histocompatibility antigens derive from differences between the
HLA-­matched recipient and donor in peptides that are presented by the
same HLA allotype. These antigens result from polymorphisms of non-­
HLA proteins, differences in the level of expression of proteins, or genetic
differences between males and females. An example of the latter is represented by the H-­Y antigens encoded by the Y chromosome, which can
stimulate GVHD when a female donor is employed to transplant an HLA-­
identical male recipient. Thus, from this evidence, GVHD may occur even
when the donor and recipient are HLA identical.
The preferred donor for any patient undergoing HSCT has traditionally been an HLA-­identical sibling. Because polymorphic HLA genes
are closely linked and usually constitute a single genetic locus, any
pair of siblings has a 25% chance of being HLA identical. Thus, also in
view of the limited family size in the developed countries, <25–30%
of patients in need of an allograft can receive their transplant from an
HLA-­identical sibling. This percentage is even lower in patients with
inherited disorders because affected siblings will not be considered
donor candidates.

HSCT FROM AN HLA–IDENTICAL SIBLING DONOR

Allogeneic HSCT from an HLA-­compatible sibling is the treatment of
choice for children with hematologic malignancies and various congenital or acquired diseases (Table 177.1). Best results are achieved in
patients with congenital or acquired nonmalignant disorders because
the risk of disease recurrence is low and the cumulative transplantation-­
related mortality is lower than in children receiving transplants for
hematologic malignancies.

ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

Allogeneic HSCT is used for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), either in the first complete remission when a child is considered at high risk of leukemia recurrence (e.g., those carrying poor-­risk
cytogenetic characteristics or with high levels of minimal residual disease),
or in second or further complete remission after previous marrow relapse.
ALL is the most common indication for HSCT in childhood. Several
patient-­, donor-­, disease-­, and transplant-­related variables may influence
the outcome of patients with ALL given an allogeneic HSCT. The probabilities of 3-­year overall survival (OS) for US patients <18 years of age
with ALL transplanted in the first or second complete remission is 70–80%
and 60–70%, respectively. Inferior results are obtained in patients receiving
transplants in more advanced disease phases (50–60%; Fig. 177.1). The use
of total body irradiation (TBI) during the preparative regimen offers an
advantage in terms of better event-­free survival (EFS) compared to a regimen consisting of cytotoxic drugs alone, but it can induce more long-­term
side effects. This has prompted more investigation into TBI-­sparing alternatives. Less intensive GVHD prophylaxis is also associated with a better
outcome. Bone marrow is generally the preferred source of stem cells to
be employed for transplantation, although this differs among transplant
centers.
Although the main benefit for allogeneic HSCT recipients with
leukemia derives from the GVL effect displayed by immunocompetent cells, disease recurrence remains the main cause of treatment

toward target antigens expressed by leukemic cells. When expressed
by T cells, CARs mediate antigen recognition and tumor cytolysis in
an MHC-­unrestricted fashion and can target any molecule (protein,
carbohydrate, or glycolipid) expressed on the surface of tumor cells,
thus bypassing one of the major tumor escape mechanisms based
on the downregulation of MHC molecules. CARs are composed of
an extracellular specific antigen-­binding moiety, obtained from the
variable regions of a monoclonal antibody, linked together to form a
single-­chain antibody (scFv), and of an intracellular signaling component derived from the ζ chain of the T-­cell receptor (TCR)-­CD3
complex. The addition to the CAR gene construct of co-­stimulation
signals and cytokines promoting T-­
cell expansion and survival
improves the antitumor efficiency of the engineered T cells and their
survival in the tumor milieu. Gamma retrovirus and lentiviruses are
usually used to transduce CARs into T lymphocytes to be employed
in the clinical setting. These vectors have been shown to efficiently
infect T lymphocytes, integrate into the host genome, and produce
robust expression of the gene in human T cells and their progeny.

ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA
failure. The risk of failing to eradicate leukemia is influenced by
many variables, including disease phase, molecular lesions of tumor
cells, and disparity for major or minor histocompatibility antigens
in the donor/recipient pairs. To overcome the hurdle of tumor elusion caused by HLA loss on malignant cells, the use of non–HLA-­
restricted chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has also been used.
This therapeutic strategy is based on genetic reprogramming of T
cells through artificial immune receptors that reproducibly and efficiently redirect the antigen specificity of polyclonal T lymphocytes

Allogeneic HSCT is largely employed as postremission treatment of
pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who meet certain high-­risk disease criteria. This subset of children with AML in first
complete remission who are given allogeneic HSCT as consolidation
therapy have a better probability of EFS than those treated with either
chemotherapy alone or autologous transplantation. Results obtained in
patients given HSCT after either a TBI-­containing or a chemotherapy-­
based preparative regimen are similar. Therefore, for AML, conditioning regimens generally omit the use of TBI because of associated
long-­term side effects. Children with acute promyelocytic leukemia in

molecular remission at the end of treatment with chemotherapy and
all-­trans-­retinoic acid, or with AML and translocation t(8;21) inversion of chromosome 16 (inv16), translocation t(16;16), or normal cytogenetics and presence of NPM1 or CEPBα pathogenic variants are no
longer considered eligible for allogeneic HSCT in first complete remission in view of their improved prognosis with alternative treatments.
Studies suggest restricting the use of HSCT to those patients with poor
molecular lesions, such as FLT3-­internal tandem duplication or mixed-­
lineage leukemia abnormalities, or with high levels of minimal residual
disease at the end of induction therapy. Approximately 40–60% of pediatric patients with AML in the second complete remission can be rescued by HSCT. The probabilities of 3-­year OS for US patients <18 years
of age with AML transplanted in the first or second complete remission is 60–70%. Similar to ALL, inferior results are obtained in patients
receiving transplants in more advanced disease phases (30–40%).

CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

For many years, allogeneic HSCT has been considered the only proven
curative treatment for children with Philadelphia-­
positive (Ph+)
chronic myelogenous leukemia. Leukemia-­free survival of chronic
myelogenous leukemia patients after an allograft is 45–80%. The phase
of disease (chronic phase, accelerated phase, blast crisis), recipient age,
type of donor employed (related or unrelated), and time between diagnosis and HSCT are the main factors influencing the outcome. The best
results are obtained in children transplanted during the chronic phase
from an HLA-­identical sibling within 1 year from diagnosis. Unlike
other forms of pediatric leukemia, infusion of donor leukocytes can
reinduce a state of complete remission in a large proportion of patients
experiencing leukemia relapse.
Treatment with the specific BCR-­
ABL tyrosine protein kinase
inhibitors (imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib), targeting the enzymatic activity of the BCR-­ABL fusion protein, has modified the natural history of the disease and thus the indications for transplantation.
The indication for HSCT in this population is generally reserved for
patients with a poor response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors or those
who do not tolerate their side effects.

JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare hematopoietic
malignancy of early childhood, representing 2–3% of all pediatric
leukemias. JMML is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly and organ
infiltration, with excessive proliferation of cells of monocytic and
granulocytic lineages. Hypersensitivity to granulocyte-­
macrophage
colony-­stimulating factor (GM-­CSF) and pathologic activation of the
RAS-­RAF-­MAP (mitogen-­activated protein) kinase signaling pathway
play an important role in the pathophysiology. JMML usually runs
an aggressive clinical course, with a median duration of survival for
untreated children of <12 months from diagnosis. Rare patients with
CBL1 or N-­RAS mutations can survive for years without an allograft.
HSCT can cure approximately 50–60% of patients with JMML.
Patients who receive a transplant from an unrelated donor have comparable outcome to those given HSCT from an HLA-­
compatible
related donor. Cord blood transplantation represents a suitable alternative option. Leukemia recurrence is the main cause of treatment failure
in children with JMML after HSCT, with the relapse rate as high as
40–50%. Because children with JMML frequently have massive spleen
enlargement, splenectomy has been performed before transplantation.
Spleen size at the time of HSCT and splenectomy before HSCT do not
appear to affect the posttransplantation outcome. Donor leukocyte
infusion is not useful to rescue patients experiencing disease recurrence; a second allograft can induce sustained remission in approximately 30% of children with JMML relapsing after a first HSCT.

MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES OTHER THAN
JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral
blood cytopenia and a propensity to evolve toward AML. HSCT is the
treatment of choice for children with refractory anemia with excess
of blasts (RAEB) and for those with RAEB in transformation (RAEB­t). The probability of survival without evidence of disease for these

children is 65–70%. It is still unclear whether patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and a blast percentage >20% benefit from pretransplantation chemotherapy. HSCT from an HLA-­identical sibling is
also the preferred treatment for all children with refractory cytopenia.
Transplantation is also considered in children with refractory cytopenia associated with monosomy 7, GATA 2 deficiency, complex karyotype, life-­threatening infections, profound neutropenia, or transfusion
dependency. For children with refractory cytopenia, the probability
of EFS after HSCT may be as high as 80%, and disease recurrence is
rarely observed. This observation has provided the rationale for testing
reduced-­intensity regimens in these patients.

NON-­HODGKIN LYMPHOMA AND HODGKIN
DISEASE

Childhood non-­Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin disease (HD)
are very responsive to conventional chemoradiotherapy; some patients
have refractory disease or are at high risk for relapse. HSCT can cure
a proportion of patients with relapsed NHL and HD and should be
offered early after relapse, while the disease is still sensitive to therapy.
If an HLA-­matched donor is available, allogeneic transplantation can
be offered to patients with NHL to take advantage of the GVL effect.
Patients with sensitive disease and limited tumor burden have favorable
outcomes, with EFS rates of 50–60%. Patients with relapsed or refractory
HD do well after autologous HSCT, with EFS of 50–60%. HD patients
may also benefit from a GVL effect when given an allograft.

ACQUIRED APLASTIC ANEMIA

Because the probability of long-­term survival for a matched-­sibling
bone marrow transplant (BMT) is reproducibly >80% for children and
young adults, BMT is the treatment of choice for children and young
adults with acquired severe aplastic anemia. Historically, the treatment
of choice for children and young adults without an HLA-­matched sibling has been intensive immunosuppression. Because the outcomes of
matched unrelated donor transplant for children with acquired aplastic
anemia have improved substantially over the years, the use of unrelated donor HSCT upfront without prior immunosuppressive therapy
is being considered more frequently.
For patients who do not have a matched-­sibling donor or well-­matched
unrelated donor, historically the transplant options were very disappointing. Fortunately, there is hope in using haploidentical transplant for this
disease. The use of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen combined
with GVHD prophylaxis, including posttransplant cyclophosphamide,
have shown significant improvement over prior experiences with survival
approaching transplants using well matched unrelated donors.

INHERITED BONE MARROW FAILURE SYNDROMES

Fanconi anemia (FA) and dyskeratosis congenita are genetic disorders
associated with a high risk of developing pancytopenia. FA is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by spontaneous chromosomal
fragility, which is increased after exposure of peripheral blood lymphocytes to DNA crosslinking agents, including clastogenic compounds
such as diepoxybutane, mitomycin C, and melphalan. Patients with
FA, along with being at risk for pancytopenia, show a high propensity
to develop clonal disorders of hematopoiesis, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. HSCT can rescue aplastic anemia and prevent the occurrence of clonal hematopoietic disorders. In view of their
defects in DNA repair mechanisms, which are responsible for the chromosomal fragility, FA patients have an exquisite sensitivity to alkylating agents and radiation therapy. Thus they must be prepared for the
allograft with reduced doses of cyclophosphamide and only judicious
use of radiation. Many FA patients were once successfully transplanted
after receiving low-­
dose cyclophosphamide and thoracoabdominal
irradiation. However, the use of this regimen is associated with an
increased incidence of posttransplantation head and neck cancers.
Low-­dose cyclophosphamide combined with fludarabine has been very
well tolerated in patients with FA who have a matched-­related donor.
The addition of low-­dose TBI and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for
those with an unrelated donor has shown similar success. Currently,
the 5-­year OS is >90% in patients with FA who receive HSCT before the
transformation to hematologic malignancy. Because of their underlying disorder, however, patients with FA must be monitored closely in

THALASSEMIA

Conventional treatment (i.e., regular blood transfusion and iron-­
chelation therapy) has dramatically improved both the survival and
the quality of life of patients with thalassemia, changing a previously
fatal disease with early death to a chronic, slowly progressive disease
compatible with prolonged survival. However, HSCT remains the only
curative treatment for patients with thalassemia. In these patients the
risk of dying from transplant-­related complications depends primarily
on patient age, iron overload, and concomitant hepatic viral infections.
Adults, especially with chronic active hepatitis, have a poorer outcome
than children. Among children, three classes of risk have been identified on the basis of three parameters: regularity of previous iron chelation, liver enlargement, and presence of portal fibrosis. In pediatric
patients without liver disease who have received regular iron chelation
(class 1 patients), the probability of survival with transfusion independence is >90%, whereas for patients with low compliance with iron
chelation and signs of severe liver damage (class 3 patients), the probability of survival has been 60%.
With improvements in supportive care and conditioning regimens,
even patients with more advanced liver disease have had excellent outcomes (Fig. 177.2). The most effective pharmacologic combinations
(e.g., including cyclosporine and methotrexate) should be employed
to prevent GVHD. The outcome of patients transplanted from an unrelated donor has been reported similar to that of HLA-­identical sibling
recipients. The increased use of umbilical cord blood and haploidentical donors in this population is being explored to expand the number of patients eligible for HSCT. Also, advancements in gene therapy
are being made in thalassemia in clinical trials, which may eventually
change the approach to this disease.

SICKLE CELL DISEASE

Disease severity varies greatly among patients with sickle cell disease,
with 5–20% of the overall population suffering significant morbidity
from vasoocclusive crises and pulmonary, renal, or neurologic damage. Hydroxyurea, an agent favoring the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin,
reduces the frequency and severity of vasoocclusive crises and improves
the quality of life for patients with sickle cell disease; however, allogeneic
HSCT is the only curative treatment for this disease currently. Although
HSCT can cure homozygous hemoglobin S, hemoglobin Sβ0, or hemoglobin sickle cell disease, selecting appropriate candidates for transplantation is difficult. Patients with sickle cell disease may survive for decades,
but some patients have a poor quality of life, with repeated hospitalizations for painful vasoocclusive crises and central nervous system (CNS)
infarcts. The main indications for performing HSCT in patients with
sickle cell disease are history of strokes or abnormal transcranial Doppler
ultrasound, recurrent acute chest syndrome, and/or recurrent vasoocclusive crises. The results of HSCT are best when performed in children with
an HLA-­identical sibling, with a probability of cure of 80–90%. However,
the use of alternative donor transplants in this population, including
matched unrelated donors and haploidentical donors, is being investigated through a number of clinical trials and may increase the number of
patients eligible to undergo potentially curative HSCT. Reduced-­intensity
and reduced-­toxicity regimens are also being explored to further decrease
transplant-­related morbidity and mortality, although graft failure remains
an important issue in this patient population. Gene therapy for sickle cell
disease is currently being investigated in clinical trials.

immunodeficiencies, including Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome, leukocyte
adhesion deficiency (LAD), and chronic granulomatous disease (see
Table 177.1). With an HLA-­identical sibling, the probability of survival
approaches 100%, with less favorable results for patients transplanted
from an HLA–partially matched relative. Some children with SCID,
mainly those without residual natural killer activity or maternal T-­cell
engraftment, may be transplanted without receiving any preparative
regimen; the donor lymphoid cells are usually the only elements that
engraft. Sustained donor engraftment is more difficult to achieve in
children with Omenn syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLD), or LAD. Life-­threatening opportunistic fungal and viral
infections occurring before the allograft adversely affect the patient’s
outcome after HSCT. Because of this, patients with the most severe
immunodeficiencies must be transplanted as early as possible to prevent infectious complications.

INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASES

Inherited metabolic diseases are a broad group of diseases that result
from the accumulation of substrate within tissues caused by dysfunction of the lysosome or peroxisome. The use of HSCT has been
established for a variety of inherited metabolic diseases, including
mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (Hurler syndrome) and adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Although some of these diseases are treatable with
exogenous enzyme replacement therapy, the clinical manifestations
of disease tend to progress over time, especially disease in the CNS,
where enzyme is unable to be reliably delivered. It is thought that
undergoing HSCT results in the engraftment of microglial cells that
are able to provide new enzyme to the areas where enzyme replacement therapy, if available, cannot have a substantial impact. Multiple
studies have shown significantly improved outcomes for patients who
are diagnosed with their underlying conditions relatively early and are
able to undergo HSCT expeditiously, before significant damage from
accumulated substrate that may be irreversible.

Chapter 178 u Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation from Alternative Sources and Donors

Chapter 178

Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation from
Alternative Sources and
Donors
Rachel A. Phelan and David Margolis
Two thirds of patients who need allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) do not have an available HLA-­identical sibling. Alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are being increasingly
used and include matched unrelated donors, unrelated umbilical cord
blood, and HLA-­haploidentical relatives. Each of these three options
has advantages and limitations, but rather than being considered competing alternatives, they should be regarded as complementary strategies
to be chosen after a careful evaluation of the relative risks and benefits in
the patient’s best interest. The choice of the donor will depend on various factors related to urgency of transplantation; patient-­, disease-­, and
transplant-­related factors; center experience; and physician preference.

UNRELATED DONOR TRANSPLANTS

One of the most widely used strategies for children who need an
allograft and do not have an available HLA-­identical sibling is to
identify an unrelated HLA-­matched donor in a registry. Worldwide
international registries include almost 27 million HLA-­typed volunteer donors. HLA-­A, HLA-­B, HLA-­C class I loci, and the DRB1 class
II locus are the HLA loci that most influence outcome after HSCT
from an unrelated volunteer. Other class II loci (namely, DQB1 and
DP1 loci), as well as killer cell immunoglobulin-­like receptor (KIR)
haplotypes, are also increasingly considered when choosing a donor,
although their impact on outcome is less well elucidated.
Although in the past serologic (low-­resolution) typing was used for
HLA-­A and HLA-­B loci, currently the unrelated donors are selected using
high-­resolution (allelic) molecular typing of loci HLA-­A, HLA-­B, HLA-­
C, and -­DRB1. The chance of finding an HLA-­matched unrelated donor
depends on the frequency of the HLA phenotype, which is closely linked
to the ethnic origin of the registry donors. Data from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donor registry and banked cord blood units
estimated that essentially every patient in need of a transplant would be
able to find a donor in a timely fashion, despite the recipient’s race/ethnic
group, donor availability, and cell dose. However, many of those patients
may not have access to an “ideal” graft, defined as HLA matching of a
minimum of 8/8 for bone marrow and 6/6 for cord blood.
Initially, HLA polymorphism and the intrinsic limitations of conventional (i.e., serologic) HLA-­typing techniques unfavorably affected
the accuracy of matching, thus increasing rejection rates and the incidence of acute and chronic graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD). The
advent of both high-­resolution molecular HLA classes I and II loci typing coupled with progress in the prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD
has resulted in a reduction of transplantation-­related mortality and
improvement in outcome. Indeed, outcomes from a fully matched
unrelated volunteer donor are now similar to those of HSCT from an
HLA-­identical sibling. The outcomes of haploidentical transplantation are similarly reaching that of matched unrelated donors as well as
matched sibling donors.
Although a single locus disparity in patients with leukemia may be
seen as beneficial by a reduction in the relapse rate caused by the graft-­
versus-­leukemia (GVL) effect, in patients with nonmalignant disorders
in whom GVL is not beneficial, optimal results are obtained only when
a donor matched at the allelic level with the recipient is selected. In
general, a single HLA disparity in the donor-­recipient pair, irrespective

1355

of whether antigenic or allelic in nature, predicts a greater risk of nonleukemia mortality; multiple allelic disparities at different HLA loci
have an additive detrimental effect and are associated with an even
worse outcome. To reduce the risk of acute GVHD, ex vivo T-­cell depletion of the graft has been employed, with variable efficacy. Studies are
looking at selectively depleting donor α/β T cells, which are the T cells
that drive GVHD, while preserving the T cells and natural killer (NK)
cells, which may be responsible for GVL and protection from infection.
Although the majority of patients who have required a matched unrelated donor transplant have received a bone marrow or peripheral stem
cell graft, for patients who urgently need a transplant, the time required
to identify a suitable donor from a potential panel, establish eligibility, and
harvest the cells may lead to relapse and failure to transplant. For this subset of patients who urgently need a transplant, attention has focused on
unrelated cord blood and HLA-­haploidentical, mismatched family donors.

UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANTS

Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is a viable option for
children who need allogeneic HSCT. UCBT offers the advantages
of absence of risks to donors, reduced risk of transmitting infections, and for transplants from unrelated donors, immediate availability of cryopreserved cells, with the median time from start of
search to transplantation of only 3-­4 weeks. Compared with bone
marrow transplantation (BMT), the advantages of UCBT are also
represented by lower incidence of chronic GVHD and the possibility of using donors showing HLA disparities with the recipient.
Despite these advantages, the large experience gained over the last
2 decades has demonstrated that UCBT patients may be exposed to
an increased risk of early fatal complications, mainly because of a
lower engraftment rate of donor hematopoiesis, delayed kinetics of
neutrophil recovery (risk of infection), and lack of adoptive transfer of pathogen-­specific memory T cells. Transfer of donor-­derived,
memory T cells significantly contributes to early immunologic reconstitution of children after unmanipulated allogeneic bone marrow or
peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
Concerning the issues of engraftment and hematopoietic recovery, it
has been demonstrated that an inverse correlation exists between the
number of nucleated cord blood cells infused per kilogram recipient
body weight and the risk of dying for transplantation-­related causes.
In particular, engraftment is a major concern when the nucleated cells
are <2.5 × 107/kg of recipient body weight. Because a cord blood unit
usually contains between 1 × 109 and 1.8 × 109 cells, it is not surprising
that UCBT has been less frequently employed for adolescents or adults
with body weight >40 kg. Indeed, it can be estimated that only 30% of
the UCB units available in the bank inventory could suffice for a 75
kg patient, according to the recommended threshold cell dose. Efforts
have focused on approaches capable of increasing the number of UCB
cells to be transplanted. Selection of the richest cord blood units or
infusion of 2 units in the same recipient (i.e., double UCBT) have been
explored to improve the results of UCBT. The results of these studies have been mixed, with one large study demonstrating no survival
advantage for children and adolescents that receive double UCBT. Preliminary studies of ex vivo expansion of a single umbilical cord sample
with UM171, an HSC self-­renewal agonist, have suggested improved
engraftment, reduced infection, and low rates of severe acute GVHD.
The long-­term results of UCB transplants are similar to those after
transplantation from other sources of HSCs for pediatric hematologic
malignancies. In patients with hematologic malignancies, recipients of
UCBT may be transplanted from donors with greater HLA disparities,
receive 1-­log fewer nucleated cells, have delayed neutrophil and platelet
recovery, and show reduced incidence of GVHD compared with children
given BMT from unrelated donors. In one study, there were similar rates
of acute GVHD, but significantly less chronic GVHD in patients who
received UCBT. Nevertheless, both the relapse rate and the overall survival
probability did not differ in unrelated UCBT or BMT pediatric recipients.
Thus, in the absence of an HLA-­identical family donor, unrelated UCBT
can be considered a suitable option for children with malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Results of UCBT have been of particular interest in
children with certain nonmalignant disorders to proceed to transplant
quickly and prevent further progression of disease.

HAPLOIDENTICAL TRANSPLANTS

HSCT from an HLA-­haploidentical (haplo-­HSCT) donor offers an
immediate source of HSCs to almost all patients who fail to find a
matched donor, whether related or unrelated, or a suitable cord blood
unit. Indeed, almost all children have at least one haploidentical–3
loci mismatched family member who is promptly available as donor.
The few patients who reject the haploidentical transplant also have the
advantage of another immediately available donor within the family.
Moreover, this may represent an approach that would be attractive in
the global health setting, where more sophisticated donor registries
and cell-­processing techniques are less unavailable.
Efficient T-­cell depletion of the graft has been demonstrated to
prevent acute and chronic GVHD even when using haploidentical
parental grafts. This can be done ex vivo or in vivo with the use of chemotherapeutic agents before and after cell infusion. The use of posttransplant cyclophosphamide is one such in vivo technique now being
widely incorporated into haploidentical transplant regimens. The benefits of T-­cell depletion were first demonstrated in transplantation of
children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). More than
300 transplants in SCID patients using haploidentical donors have
been performed worldwide, with a high rate of long-­term partial or
complete immune reconstitution.
The elimination of mature T cells from the graft, necessary for preventing GVHD in a context of great immune genetic disparity, results in recipients being unable to benefit from the adoptive transfer of donor memory
T lymphocytes, through their peripheral expansion, are the main factor
responsible for protection from infections in the first few months after
transplantation. A state of profound immunodeficiency lasts for at least
4-­6 months after transplantation in haplo-­HSCT recipients. Sophisticated
strategies of adoptive infusions of T-­cell lines or clones specific for the
most common and life-­threatening pathogens (Epstein-­Barr virus [EBV],
human cytomegalovirus, Aspergillus, adenovirus) have been successfully
tested in trials to protect the recipients in the early posttransplant period.
For many years the absence of the T-­cell–mediated GVL effect
has been considered as rendering the recipients of a T-­cell–depleted
allograft more susceptible to leukemia relapse. However, it has been
demonstrated that a GVL effect displayed by donor NK cells can compensate for this lack of T-­specific alloreactivity when an HLA-­disparate
NK-­alloreactive relative is employed as a donor.
Selective approaches of graft manipulation in haploidentical and unrelated donor transplant have also been developed. In particular, promising
results have been obtained through a negative depletion of T lymphocytes
carrying the α/β chains of the T-­cell receptor, which are believed to be the
mediators of GVHD. B lymphocytes are also depleted to prevent EBV-­
related lymphoproliferative disease. Through this approach the patient
can benefit from the adoptive transfer of committed hematopoietic progenitors, mature NK cells and γ/δ+ T cells, which can confer a protection
against life-­threatening infections as well as provide a GVL effect.
The outcomes of haplo-­HSCT have been more extensively reported
in adults than in children. The reported probability of survival at 3-­4
yr after a haplo-­HSCT in children with acute leukemia ranged from
18–48%. Survival was influenced by many factors, most importantly
the state of remission at transplantation, with poorer outcomes in children with myeloid leukemias than in those with lymphoid leukemia. In
haplotype-­mismatched parent-­to-­child HSCT, patients with acute leukemia grafted from the mother had reduced relapse rates compared with
recipients of paternal grafts, translating into better event-­free survival.

DONOR VERSUS RECIPIENT NK CELL
ALLOREACTIVITY

NK cells are the first lymphocytes derived from the donor to recover
after allogeneic HCT. Donor versus recipient NK cell alloreactivity
derives from a mismatch between donor NK clones, carrying specific
inhibitory receptors for self–major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I molecules, and MHC class I ligands on recipient cells. NK cells are
primed to kill by several activating receptors, which play an important
role in the NK cell–mediated GVL effect. Human NK cells discriminate
allelic forms of MHC molecules via KIRs, which are clonally distributed with each cell in the repertoire bearing at least one receptor that
is specific for self-­MHC class I molecules. Because NK cells co-­express

treatments

inhibitory receptors for self–MHC class I molecules, autologous cells
are not killed. When faced with mismatched allogeneic targets, NK cells
sense the missing expression of self–class I alleles and mediate alloreactions. In mismatched transplants, there are many donor recipient pairs
in which the donor NK inhibitory cells do not recognize the recipient’s
class I alleles as self. Consequently, the donor NK cells are not blocked
and are activated to lyse the recipient’s lymphohematopoietic cells.
Haplo-­
HSCT trials demonstrate that MHC class I mismatches,
which generate an alloreactive NK cell response in the graft-­versus-­
host direction, eradicate leukemia cells, improve engraftment, and
protect from T-­cell–mediated GVHD. The potential for donor versus
recipient NK cell alloreactivity, which can be predicted by standard
HLA typing, is increasingly being examined when selecting the donor
of choice. The importance of KIR haplotype in transplants other than
haploidentical transplantation in preventing GVHD as well as relapse
has been shown to be increasingly beneficial.

AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL
TRANSPLANTATION

Autologous transplantation, using the patient’s own stored marrow, is
associated with a low risk of life-­threatening transplant-­related complications, although the main cause of failure is disease recurrence. Bone
marrow was once the only source of stem cells employed in patients
given an autograft. The majority of patients treated with autologous
HSCT receive hematopoietic progenitors mobilized in peripheral blood
by either cytokines alone (mainly granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor) or by cytokines plus cytotoxic agents. A CXCR4 antagonist can
be extremely effective in mobilizing hematopoietic progenitors in the
periphery. Compared with bone marrow, the use of peripheral blood
progenitors is associated with a faster hematopoietic recovery and a
comparable outcome.
Autologous HSCT is employed primarily for selected children with
relapsed lymphomas and select solid tumors (Table 178.1).
Patients with sensitive lymphomas and minimal tumor burden have
favorable outcomes after autologous HSCT, with disease-­free survival
rates of 50–60%, whereas high-­risk patients with bulky tumor or poorly
responsive disease have a poor outcome, with survival rates of 10–20%.
Autologous HSCT in patients with high-­risk neuroblastoma is associated with a better outcome than conventional chemotherapy. A Children’s Oncology Group (COG) study demonstrated further survival
advantage by performing two sequential, or tandem, transplants that
use different chemotherapeutic agents. Because of these improved outcomes, tandem autologous transplants are now considered the standard recommended treatment. In these patients, posttransplantation
infusion of a monoclonal antibody directed against a molecule (GD2)
expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells confers a protection
against the risk of tumor recurrence.
For children with brain tumors at high risk of relapse, or resistant
to conventional chemotherapy and irradiation, the dose-­limiting toxicity for intensifying therapy is myelosuppression, thus providing a
role for stem cell rescue. Several studies provide encouraging results
for patients with different histologic types of brain tumors treated with
autologous HSCT.

Chapter 179

Graft-­Versus-­Host
­Disease, Rejection, and
Venoocclusive Disease
Rachel A. Phelan and David Margolis
A major cause of mortality and morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is graft-­versus-­host
disease (GVHD), which is caused by engraftment of immunocompetent donor T lymphocytes in an immunologically compromised
host who shows histocompatibility differences with the donor. These
differences between the donor and the host may result in donor
T-­cell activation against either recipient major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) antigens or minor histocompatibility antigens.
GVHD is usually subdivided in two forms: acute GVHD, which
occurs within 3 months after transplantation, and chronic GVHD,
which, although related, is a different disease, occurring later and
displaying some clinical and pathologic features that resemble those
observed in selected autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic sclerosis,
Sjögren syndrome).

after exposure to recipient antigens. This approach has been successful in patients undergoing haploidentical transplantation. Pretransplantation infusion of either antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as alemtuzumab is largely used
to modulate alloreactivity of donor T cells, in particular in patients
given the allograft from either an unrelated donor or a partially
matched relative. An alternative approach is the removal of T lymphocytes from the graft (T-­cell depletion). Other approaches are
being used to selectively remove the α/β T cells, which are thought
to be responsible for the development of GVHD, while preserving
the γ/δ T cells in order to sustain graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) and
the ability to fight infection. Any form of GVHD prophylaxis may
impair posttransplantation immunologic reconstitution, increasing
the risk of infection-­related deaths. Traditional T-­cell depletion of
the graft is also associated with an increased risk of leukemia recurrence in patients transplanted from an HLA-­identical sibling or an
unrelated volunteer.
Despite prophylaxis, significant acute GVHD develops in approximately 30% of recipients of HSCT from matched siblings and in
as many as 60% of HSCT recipients from unrelated donors. These
numbers are estimates, and the actual risk of acute GVHD is highly
variable depending on several factors. Risk for development of
GVHD is increased by diagnosis of malignant disease, older donor
and recipient age, and in patients given an unmanipulated allograft.
The most important risk factor for acute GVHD is the presence of
disparities for HLA molecules in the donor-­recipient pair.
Acute GVHD is usually initially treated with glucocorticoids;
approximately 40–50% of patients show a complete response to

ACUTE GRAFT-­VERSUS-­HOST DISEASE

Acute GVHD is caused by the alloreactive, donor-­derived T cells
contained in the graft, which attack nonshared recipient’s antigens
on target tissues. A 3-­step process generates the clinical syndrome.
First, conditioning-­
induced tissue damage activates recipient
antigen-­presenting cells, which present recipient alloantigens to the
donor T cells transferred with the graft and secrete cytokines, such
as interleukin (IL)-­12, favoring the polarization of T-­cell response
in the type 1 direction. Second, in response to recipient antigens,
donor T cells become activated, proliferate, expand, and generate
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-­α, IL-­2, and interferon (IFN)-­γ. In the third step of the process, these cytokines cause
tissue damage and promote differentiation of cytotoxic CD8+ T
cells, which, together with macrophages, kill recipient cells and further disrupt tissues.
Acute GVHD usually develops 2-­8 weeks after transplantation.
The primary manifestations depend on the sites of involvement and
may include an erythematous maculopapular rash (Figs. 179.1 and
179.2), persistent anorexia, vomiting and/or diarrhea, and liver disease with increased serum levels of bilirubin, alanine transaminase
(ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP). Diagnosis may benefit from skin, liver, or gastrointestinal
(GI) biopsy for confirmation. Endothelial damage and lymphocytic
infiltrates are seen in all affected organs. The epidermis and hair
follicles of the skin are damaged, the hepatic small bile ducts show
segmental disruption, and there is destruction of the crypts and
mucosal ulceration of the GI tract. Grade I acute GVHD (skin rash
alone) has a favorable prognosis and often requires no treatment,
or topical treatment alone. Grade II GVHD is a moderately severe
multiorgan disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Grade
III GVHD is a severe multiorgan disease, and grade IV GVHD is a
life-­threatening, often fatal condition (Table 179.1).
The standard pharmacologic prophylaxis of GVHD after an
unmanipulated allograft relies mainly on posttransplant administration of immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine or
tacrolimus or combinations of either with methotrexate or prednisone, anti–T-­cell antibodies, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and
other immunosuppressive agents. Infusion of cyclophosphamide on
days +3 and +4 after transplantation has been used as a strategy
to deplete alloreactive donor T lymphocytes that become activated

corticosteroids. The risk of transplantation-­
related mortality is
much higher in patients who do not respond to corticosteroids
than in those showing a complete response. Ruxolitinib, targeting the JAK signaling pathway, or other drugs targeting molecules
expressed on T cells or cytokines released during the inflammatory
cascade (including infliximab and etanercept targeting TNF, vedolizumab targeting α₄β₇-­integrin, and tocilizumab targeting IL-­6),
which underlies the pathophysiology of GVHD, have been used in
patients with steroid-­resistant acute GVHD. Extracorporeal photopheresis is another second-­line treatment for GVHD and is most
efficacious for skin GVHD. A patient’s peripheral blood is exposed
to a photosensitive compound and then exposed to ultraviolet light.
The cells are then reinfused into the patient. It is thought that this
process results in an increase in apoptosis of lymphocytes responsible for GVHD as well as the upregulation of anti-­inflammatory
cytokines and regulatory T cells. Promising results in children with
steroid-­resistant acute GVHD have also been obtained using mesenchymal stromal cells, which are able to blunt the inflammatory
response associated with acute GVHD.

CHRONIC GRAFT-­VERSUS-­HOST DISEASE

Chronic GVHD develops or persists >3 months after transplantation
and is the most frequent late complication of allogeneic HSCT with
an incidence of approximately 25% in pediatric patients. Chronic
GVHD is the major cause of nonrelapse mortality and morbidity in
long-­term HSCT survivors. Acute GVHD is recognized as the most
important factor predicting the development of the chronic form of
the disease. The use of matched unrelated volunteers as donors and
use of unmanipulated peripheral blood as the stem cell source have
increased the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD. Other factors
that predict occurrence of chronic GVHD include older donor and
recipient ages, female donor for male recipient, diagnosis of malignancy, and use of total body irradiation (TBI) as part of the preparative regimen.
Chronic GVHD is a disorder of immune regulation characterized by autoantibody production, increased collagen deposition
and fibrosis, and clinical symptoms similar to those seen in patients
with autoimmune diseases (Table 179.2). The predominant cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of chronic GVHD are usually

type II cytokines such as IL-­4, IL-­5, and IL-­13. IL-­4 and IL-­5 contribute to eosinophilia and B-­cell hyperactivity with elevated IgM,
IgG, and IgE titers. Associated monoclonal gammopathies indicate
clonal dysregulation. Chronic GVHD is dependent on the development and persistence of donor T cells that are not tolerant to the
recipient. Maturation of transplanted stem cells within a damaged
thymus could lead to errors in negative selection and production
of cells that have not been tolerized to recipient antigens and are
therefore autoreactive or, more accurately, recipient reactive. This
ongoing immune reactivity results in clinical features resembling
a systemic autoimmune disease with lichenoid and sclerodermatous skin lesions, malar rash, sicca syndrome, arthritis, joint contractures, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bile duct degeneration with
cholestasis.
Patients with chronic GVHD involving only the skin and liver
have a favorable course (Figs. 179.3 and 179.4). Extensive multiorgan disease may be associated with a very poor quality of life,
recurrent infections associated with prolonged immunosuppressive
regimens to control GVHD, and a high mortality rate. Morbidity
and mortality are highest in patients with a progressive onset of
chronic GVHD that directly follows acute GVHD, intermediate in
those with a quiescent onset after resolution of acute GVHD, and
lowest in patients with de novo onset in the absence of acute GVHD.
Chronic GVHD can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe
depending on extent of involvement. Single-­agent prednisone is
the standard treatment, although other agents have been employed
with variable success. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, has been
a beneficial treatment for steroid-­dependent or refractory chronic
GVHD. In addition, ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic GVHD.
Treatment with imatinib mesylate, which inhibits the synthesis of
collagen, has been effective in some patients with chronic GVHD
and sclerotic features. As a consequence of prolonged immunosuppression, patients with chronic GVHD are particularly susceptible
to infections and should receive appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis,
including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Chronic
GVHD resolves in most pediatric patients but may require 1-­3 years
of immunosuppressive therapy before the drugs can be withdrawn
without the disease recurring. Chronic GVHD promotes the development of secondary neoplasms, in particular in patients with Fanconi anemia, and has a significant impact on quality of life.

Dermatology. 5th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016. p 577.)

GRAFT FAILURE

Graft failure is a serious complication exposing patients to a high
risk of fatal infection. Primary graft failure is defined as failure
to achieve a neutrophil count of 0.5 × 109/L after transplantation.
Secondary graft failure is loss of peripheral blood counts following
initial transient engraftment of donor cells. Causes of graft failure
after autologous and allogeneic transplantation include transplantation of an inadequate stem cell dose (more frequently observed
in children given cord blood transplantation) and viral infections
such as with cytomegalovirus or human herpesvirus type 6, which
are often associated with activation of recipient macrophages. Graft
failure after allogeneic transplantation, however, is mainly caused
by immunologically mediated rejection of the graft by residual
recipient-­type T cells that survive the conditioning regimen.
Diagnosis of graft failure resulting from immunologic mechanisms is based on examination of peripheral blood and marrow
aspirate and biopsy, along with molecular analysis of chimerism
status. Persistence of lymphocytes of host origin in allogeneic
transplant recipients with graft failure indicates immunologic
rejection. The risk of immune-­mediated graft rejection is higher
in patients given HLA-­disparate, T-­cell–depleted grafts, reduced-­
intensity conditioning regimens, and transplantation of low numbers of stem cells, and in recipients who are sensitized toward
major HLA antigens or, less frequently, minor histocompatibility

versus-­
host disease. Note the extensive

plaques of the scalp and back. (From Paller AS, Mancini AJ, eds. Hurwitz Clinical Pediatric Dermatology. 5th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016.

antigens. Allosensitization develops as a consequence of preceding
blood product transfusions and is observed particularly in recipients with aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. In
HSCT for nonmalignant diseases, such as mucopolysaccharidoses,
graft failure is also facilitated by the absence of previous treatment
with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs. In thalassemia, graft
failure is promoted by expansion of recipient hematopoietic cells.
GVHD prophylaxis with methotrexate, an antimetabolite, and anti-­
infective prophylaxis with TMP/SMX or ganciclovir may also delay
engraftment.
Treatment of graft failure usually requires removing all potentially myelotoxic agents from the treatment regimen and attempting
a short trial of hematopoietic growth factors, such as granulocyte
colony-­stimulating factor. A second transplant, usually preceded

results from endothelial damage within the liver, which can then
progress to multiorgan dysfunction. Onset is usually within 30
days of transplantation, with an incidence of approximately 15%,
depending on the intensity of the conditioning protocol. Risk factors include young age, prior hepatic disease (fibrosis, cirrhosis),

abdominal radiation, repeated transplantations, neuroblastoma,
osteopetrosis, and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
The severe form of VOD has a high mortality rate (>80%) without
treatment.
Prophylaxis has traditionally used ursodeoxycholic acid and occasionally heparin; only defibrotide has demonstrated efficacy in treating VOD. A phase 3 study demonstrated improvement in survival and
response rate to VOD in patients treated with defibrotide. Defibrotide
is a combination of porcine oligodeoxyribonucleotides that reduces
procoagulant activity and enhances fibrinolytic properties of endothelial cells. Defibrotide is FDA approved for the treatment of VOD in
adult and pediatric patients with renal or pulmonary dysfunction after
HSCT. Defibrotide is often used as prophylaxis in Europe, with data
showing efficacy, but this use is not yet approved in the United States.

Infectious Complications
of Hematopoietic Stem
Cell Transplantation
Anna R. Huppler
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients experience
a transient but profound state of immune deficiency. The risk of infection depends on the stage after transplantation (pre-­vs postengraftment), ongoing immunosuppression, disruption in barrier functions
(indwelling catheters, graft-­versus-­host disease [GVHD], mucositis,
and preexisting infections (Fig. 180.1). Management approaches may
include the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, preemptive antimicrobials for infection prior to symptomatic disease, or antimicrobial treatment of documented or suspected infection.

Immediately after transplantation, the absence or paucity of neutrophils (neutropenia) renders patients susceptible to bacterial and
fungal infections. Consequently, consideration is given to the use of
antipseudomonal and antifungal prophylaxis during the conditioning
regimen. Evidence is moderate quality against systemic antibacterial
prophylaxis and for systemic antifungal prophylaxis, which is reflected
in published society guidelines. Even with the use of prophylactic measures, the majority of patients will develop fever and signs of infection in the early posttransplantation period. The common pathogens
include enteric gram-­negative bacteria and fungi. An indwelling central venous line, routinely employed in all children given HSCT, is a
significant risk factor for infection. Staphylococcal species and Candida
species are the most frequent pathogens in catheter-­related infections (see
Chapter 224). Multidrug-­resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Klebsiella pneumoniae can cause infection, with prevalence highly
variable among centers. Severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by
seasonal respiratory viruses, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus, can occur
during the pre-­or postengraftment phase. Emerging infections, such as
SARS-­CoV-­2, can also cause severe or persistent infection in immunocompromised individuals. Published guidelines from the International
Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline Panel address the management of fever and neutropenia after HSCT (Table 180.1).

INITIAL MANAGEMENT
Risk Stratification
A1. Adopt a validated risk stratification strategy and incorporate it into routine clinical management (strong recommendation, low-­quality
evidence).
Evaluation
A2. Obtain blood cultures at the onset of FN from all lumens of central venous catheters (strong recommendation, low-­quality evidence).
A3. Consider obtaining peripheral blood cultures concurrent with central venous catheter cultures (weak recommendation, moderate-­quality
evidence).
A4. Consider urinalysis and urine culture in patients in whom a clean-­catch, midstream specimen is readily available (weak recommendation,
low-­quality evidence).
A5. Obtain chest radiography only in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms (strong recommendation, moderate-­quality evidence).
Treatment
A6. In high-­risk FN:
A6a. Use monotherapy with an antipseudomonal β-­lactam, a fourth-­generation cephalosporin, or a carbapenem as empirical therapy in
pediatric high-­risk FN (strong recommendation, high-­quality evidence).
A6b. Reserve addition of a second gram-­negative agent or a glycopeptide for patients who are clinically unstable, when a resistant infection is
suspected, or for centers with a high rate of resistant pathogens (strong recommendation, moderate-­quality evidence).
A7. In low-­risk FN:
A7a. Consider initial or step-­down outpatient management if the infrastructure is in place to ensure careful monitoring and follow-­up (weak
recommendation, moderate-­quality evidence).
A7b. Consider oral antibiotic administration if the child is able to tolerate this route of administration reliably (weak recommendation,
moderate-­quality evidence).
ONGOING MANAGEMENT
Modification of Treatment
B1. In patients who are responding to initial empirical antibiotic therapy, discontinue double coverage for gram-­negative infection or empirical
glycopeptide (if initiated) after 24 to 72 hours if there is no specific microbiologic indication to continue combination therapy (strong
recommendation, moderate-­quality evidence).
B2. Do not modify the initial empirical antibacterial regimen based solely on persistent fever in children who are clinically stable (strong
recommendation, low-­quality evidence).
B3. In children with persistent fever who become clinically unstable, escalate the initial empirical antibacterial regimen to include coverage for
resistant gram-­negative, gram-­positive, and anaerobic bacteria (strong recommendation, very low-­quality evidence).
Cessation of Treatment
B4. In all patients, discontinue empirical antibiotics in patients who have negative blood cultures at 48 hours, who have been afebrile for at least
24 hours, and who have evidence of marrow recovery (strong recommendation, low-­quality evidence).
B5. In patients with low-­risk FN, consider discontinuation of empirical antibiotics at 72 hours in patients who have negative blood cultures and
who have been afebrile for at least 24 hours, irrespective of marrow recovery status, as long as careful follow-­up is ensured (weak recommendation,
moderate-­quality evidence).
EMPIRICAL ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY
Risk Stratification
C1. Patients at high risk of IFD are those with AML, high-­risk ALL, or relapsed acute leukemia, and children undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Children
with prolonged neutropenia and children receiving high-­dose corticosteroids are also at high risk of IFD. All others should be categorized as
IFD low risk (strong recommendation, low-­quality evidence).
Evaluation
C2. In terms of biomarkers to guide empirical antifungal management for prolonged (≥96 hours) FN in IFD high-­risk patients:
C2a. Consider not using serum GM (weak recommendation, moderate-­quality evidence).
C2b. Do not use β-­d-­glucan (strong recommendation, low-­quality evidence).
C2c. Do not use fungal PCR testing in blood (strong recommendation, moderate-­quality evidence).
C3. In terms of imaging for the evaluation of prolonged (≥96 hours) FN in IFD high-­risk patients:
C3a. Perform CT of the lungs (strong recommendation, low-­quality evidence).
C3b. Consider imaging of abdomen in patients without localizing signs or symptoms (weak recommendation, low-­quality evidence).

HSCT recipients remain at increased risk of developing severe infections even after the neutrophil count has normalized because of prolonged depression in T-­cell number and function. The manifestations
of GVHD, as well as the associated immunosuppressive therapy, are
additional risk factors for fungal and viral opportunistic infections.
After umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT), infections are the
consequence of both slow neutrophil engraftment and donor T-­cell
naïveté. In haploidentical transplantation, T-­cell depletion results in an
increased risk of infection in the first 4-­6 months. Recipients of this
type of transplantation, as well as those receiving UCBT, do not have
the benefit of adoptive transfer of donor-­derived, antigen-­experienced
T cells. For HSCT recipients after engraftment, invasive fungal disease (IFD), herpesviruses, and adenovirus infections represent
life-­threatening complications that significantly affect outcomes. Additional pathogens to consider include nontuberculous mycobacteria,
BK virus, Clostridium difficile, and norovirus.
IFD remains a significant cause of infectious morbidity and mortality in allogeneic HSCT recipients. Empirical treatment for IFD is
considered for HSCT patients with persistent fever despite 96 hours
of broad-­spectrum antibiotic treatment. The most common organisms
are Aspergillus and Candida species. Infections also occur with non-­
Aspergillus molds, including Mucor and Rhizopus species (among other
agents of mucormycosis), Fusarium, and Scedosporium species. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a unique, noncultivatable cause of fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Despite prompt and aggressive
administration of potent antifungal agents, proven cases of IFD carry
case fatality rates of 20–70%. IFD can present early after transplant,
although there is a shift toward presentation of infection in the postengraftment period in the presence of GVHD. The risk of developing IFD
is mainly influenced by history of previous fungal infection, duration
of neutropenia, use of corticosteroid therapy, mucosal tissue damage
(GVHD, posttransplant cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection, viral respiratory tract infections), and for candidiasis, presence of central venous
catheters.
Disseminated candidiasis presents frequently as a central venous catheter–associated infection. However, up to 50% of patients with disseminated candidiasis do not present with positive blood cultures. Patients
with and without candidemia can have infection of normally sterile
organs, including liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart, and eye. Mortality
rates in pediatric series range from 10–25%. Echinocandins (micafungin,

A

B

caspofungin) are the initial drugs of choice for candidiasis in immunocompromised patients with pediatric data supporting reduced 14-­day
failure rates compared to initial triazole or amphotericin B therapy.
Pulmonary disease is the common presentation of invasive aspergillosis. The upper airway mucosa (nose and sinuses) can also be a site of
initial infection. Infection progresses from lung or sinus sites by direct
extension across tissue or angioinvasion resulting in hematogenous
dissemination to brain and other organs. The earliest imaging finding
is classically one or more small pulmonary nodules (Figs. 180.2 and
180.3). As a nodule enlarges, the dense central core of infarcted tissue may become surrounded by edema or hemorrhage, forming a hazy
rim known as the halo sign. When bone marrow function recovers, the
infarcted central core may cavitate, creating the crescent sign. Unfortunately, radiographic signs, including the halo sign, crescent sign, and
cavitation, have low sensitivity in pediatric patients. Clinical criteria are
used to diagnose proven or probable IFD, requiring direct or indirect
microbiologic data. Direct, culture-­based diagnosis requires invasive

procedures, such as sinus endoscopy or lung biopsy. Indirect measures,
including fungal biomarkers, are used in HSCT patients to screen
for or diagnose probable aspergillosis. Galactomannan from serum
or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is an adjunct to diagnostic strategies
because of a high negative predictive value for aspergillosis; however,
lack of detection of mucormycosis limits its utility as a single diagnostic test. Other limitations include poor positive predictive values due
to false-­positive test results and lack of validation in patients without
neutropenia. Another widely available biomarker, (1→3)-­β-­d-­glucan, is
insufficiently studied for routine use in pediatric patients.
Fungal infection prevention includes isolation of the patient in
a laminar airflow or positive pressure room. Universal prophylaxis
to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia is advocated until the return of
T-­cell function in HSCT patients; the primary agent for prophylaxis is
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Alternative agents are pentamidine,
dapsone, and atovaquone. For prevention and treatment of other IFDs,
liposomal amphotericin B, azole compounds (itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole), and echinocandins (caspofungin,
micafungin) are used. Voriconazole represents the treatment of choice
for adult patients with invasive aspergillosis, but achieving adequate
trough levels can be challenging in young children. The agents of
mucormycosis are resistant to most azole and echinocandin medications, which makes liposomal amphotericin B the initial drug of choice.
IFD often does not respond satisfactorily to antifungal agents alone,
and infection may persist until adequate source control is achieved
with surgical debridement and immune function recovers.
Herpesviruses, including CMV, Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV), human
herpesvirus 6 (HHV-­6), herpes simplex virus (HSV-­1 and HSV-­2), and
varicella-­zoster virus (VZV) are pathogens that can cause significant
disease after HSCT. Because herpesviruses can establish latency in the
human host, symptomatic infection can occur from viral reactivation
as well as acquisition from the donor or de novo infection. Baseline susceptibility to disease and viremia before symptom development can be
established with laboratory monitoring (pretransplant donor-­recipient
serology, posttransplant viral load monitoring) and can inform decisions on prophylactic and preemptive antiviral treatment.
CMV infection remains the most common and potentially severe
viral complication in patients receiving allogeneic HSCT. Risk factors
for CMV viremia include recipient seropositivity, UCBT, and acute
GVHD. The period of maximal risk for CMV disease is 1-­4 months
after transplantation. Late presentation of CMV disease is associated
with GVHD. Until CMV-­specific T-­cell responses develop months
after transplant, CMV infection may result in a variety of syndromes,
including fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinitis, esophagitis, gastritis, and colitis. CMV pneumonia has
been reported to occur in up to 15–20% of bone marrow transplant
recipients, with a case fatality rate of 85% in the absence of early treatment. Tachypnea, hypoxia, and nonproductive cough signal respiratory involvement. Chest radiography often reveals bilateral interstitial
or reticulonodular infiltrates, which begin in the periphery of the
lower lobes and spread centrally and superiorly. Gastrointestinal CMV
involvement may lead to ulcers of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon with complications of bleeding or perforation. Fatal
CMV infections are often associated with persistent viremia and multiorgan involvement.

CMV disease has largely been prevented through prophylaxis or
preemptive approaches. Prophylaxis is based on administration of antiviral drugs to at-­risk transplanted patients for a median duration of 3
months after transplantation. The major drawbacks of this approach
are drug toxicity, late CMV disease after withdrawal of prophylaxis,
potential unnecessary treatment of patients who would not have reactivated CMV infection, and low cost-­effectiveness. Preemptive therapy
aims at treating only patients who experience CMV reactivation and
thus are at risk of developing overt disease; it starts on detection of
CMV in blood but before symptom development. The major drawback
of this strategy is the need of serial monitoring of CMV by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) in blood. First-­line therapy is usually ganciclovir, with foscarnet as an alternative for resistant strains or ganciclovir
intolerance.
EBV-­related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD)
is a major complication in HSCT and solid-­organ transplantation. In
patients receiving HSCT, selective procedures of T-­cell depletion–
sparing B lymphocytes and use of HLA–partially matched family
and unrelated donors are risk factors for the development of PTLD.
PTLD usually presents in the first 4-­6 months after transplantation as
high-­grade, diffuse, large-­cell B-­cell lymphomas that are oligoclonal
or monoclonal. High EBV viral loads in blood by PCR predict development of PTLD. Standard treatment of PTLD includes the reduction of immunosuppression, monoclonal antibodies directed against
CD20 on B cells (rituximab), or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prophylactic strategies with rituximab for EBV-­positive recipients during
conditioning for HSCT have also been employed. Histologic diagnosis of PTLD is required to assess for the emergence of neoplasms
in which cells are CD19+ but CD20−, thus eliminating susceptibility
to rituximab.
Disseminated adenovirus infection is a life-­threatening complication of HSCT recipients. Clinical manifestations include fever, hepatitis, enteritis, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonia. Young children or
recipients of donor cells naïve to adenovirus (T-­cell–depleted grafts or
UCBT) are at particular risk of developing this complication. Diagnosis is based on the demonstration of high viral loads by PCR in blood
or recovery of virus in tissue biopsies. Pharmacologic treatment of
adenovirus infections is with the antiviral cidofovir, which has significant renal toxicity and limited potency at controlling viral replication.
The enterally available prodrug brincidofovir showed initial promise
in allogeneic pediatric HSCT recipients with refractory adenovirus
infection but is not available clinically for this indication. Recovery of
immune system function is associated with improved survival with disseminated adenovirus infection.
In immunocompromised hosts, severe viral infections, including
PTLD and adenovirus infection, originate from a deficiency of virus-­
specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This finding provides the
rationale for developing strategies of adoptive cell therapy to restore
virus-­specific immune competence. Multiple protocols are in clinical
trials and available at some centers for the rapid generation of specific
CTL lines of donor or third-­party origin.

Chapter 181 u Late Effects of ­Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

Chapter 181

Late Effects of
­Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation
Rachel A. Phelan and David Margolis
Pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered
standard-­of-­care treatment for several malignant and nonmalignant
conditions. Treatment generally involves exposure to chemotherapy
and occasionally radiation to encourage engraftment of donor stem
cells and prevent donor and recipient rejection. The period immediately
after transplant is associated with the risk for a number of serious acute
complications, including profound immunosuppression and subsequent risk for infection, graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD), and organ
toxicities (see Chapters 179 and 180). Fortunately, significant progress
has been made in supportive care strategies to reduce the risk of acute
complications and treat them more effectively if they do arise. This has
resulted in a growing number of pediatric patients who are now long-­
term survivors following HSCT. The estimated total number of HSCT
survivors in 2009 was 108,900, and this is expected to increase 5 times
by 2030 to over 500,000. Of these survivors, approximately 14% (64,000)
in 2030 will have received a transplant in childhood (<18 years of age).
Exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination of both, places
patients at similar long-­term risks as the pediatric cancer population; the
high doses and types of chemotherapy and radiation often amplify the
risk for issues such as ovarian failure/infertility and neurocognitive difficulties. Total body irradiation (TBI) has been shown to increase dramatically the risk for late complications after transplant. In addition, late
effects may be additive if the patient received therapy before HSCT for
their underlying malignancy. Moreover, the indication for transplant
in pediatric patients is not always related to malignancy, but rather an
underlying immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure syndrome, or metabolic disorder. These patients are potentially at risk for late effects related
to this underlying disease and require different types of monitoring.
Essentially, every organ system can be impacted by the long-­term
effects of therapy, and each must be considered when undergoing late
effects surveillance (Table 181.1). As a result of growing evidence of the
importance of lifelong care for HSCT survivors, multiple groups have
published consensus guidelines to help in caring for this patient population. As the field of survivorship continues to expand, we recommend the
following reference for real-­time evidence-­based recommendations from
the Children’s Oncology Group (see http://survivorshipguidelines.org).

ENDOCRINE EFFECTS

Children given HSCT before puberty may develop growth impairment, precluding achievement of the genetic target for adult height.
The decrease in growth velocity is similar for boys and girls and is more
frequently observed in patients given TBI as part of the preparative
regimen. Chronic GVHD and its treatment with corticosteroids may
also contribute to growth impairment.
Growth impairment of patients given TBI is mainly a result of direct
damage of cartilage plates and to the effect of TBI on the hypothalamic-­
pituitary axis, which leads to an inappropriately low production of
growth hormone (GH). GH deficiency is susceptible to at least partial
correction through administration of hormonal replacement therapy.
Annual growth evaluation should be performed in all children after
HSCT. Children showing a decreased growth velocity should be further investigated through evaluation of bone age and secretion of GH
in response to pharmacologic stimulus.
The use of TBI during the preparative regimen involves the thyroid gland in the irradiation field and may result in hypothyroidism.
Younger children are at greater risk of developing hypothyroidism.

1365

Chemotherapy-­
only preparative regimens have far fewer adverse
effects on normal thyroid function. The site of injury by irradiation
is at the level of the thyroid gland rather than at the pituitary or hypothalamus. Therapy with thyroxine is very effective for overt hypothyroidism. The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism increases over
time, underscoring the importance of annual thyroid function studies.
Gonadal hormones are essential for normal pubertal growth, as well
as for development of secondary sexual characteristics. A significant
proportion of patients receiving TBI-­containing preparative regimens
as well as high doses of alkylating agents show delayed development
of secondary sexual characteristics, resulting from primary ovarian or
testicular failure. Laboratory evaluation of these patients reveals elevated follicle-­stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels with
depressed estradiol and testosterone serum levels. These patients benefit
from careful follow-­up with evaluation of annual sexual maturity rating
(Tanner) scores and endocrine function. Supplementation of gonadal
hormones is useful for primary gonadal failure and is administered
with GH to promote pubertal growth. Infertility during adulthood
remains a significant risk for these patients, especially those undergoing
traditional myeloablative conditioning for HSCT. The use of reduced-­
intensity regimens may result in sparing fertility in a large proportion of
patients, although conditioning regimens vary and studies are limited.
Bone health of HSCT survivors can also be impacted by hormonal
changes as well as lifestyle practices, such as inadequate exercise and/or
dietary intake of vitamin D. Prior exposures, including corticosteroid
use, can result in changes to bone density as well as predispose to the
development of avascular necrosis. Dual-­energy x-­ray absorptiometry
(DXA) scans are routinely incorporated into the care of those patients
at risk for low bone mineral density.

CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS

Survivors of childhood HSCT are at risk for the future development of
cardiovascular complications. This population can be prone to developing metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity), especially those with a history of TBI exposure and subsequent
hormonal derangements. Prior exposures such as anthracycline chemotherapy and chest radiation further increase the risk for cardiomyopathy as well as atherosclerosis. As a result, routine anthropometric,
imaging, and laboratory screening should be performed in survivors of
childhood HSCT to assess and monitor their cardiovascular health.

SECONDARY MALIGNANCY

The overall risk of developing a secondary form of cancer is significantly higher after HSCT than in the general population. Although few
studies have specifically analyzed pediatric patients, available evidence
indicates that the cumulative incidence of second malignancies shows
a slight, but continuous, tendency to increase over time. The development of myelodysplastic syndrome as well as secondary leukemias
must be considered in survivors of HSCT. Several other types of secondary tumors have been identified in patients given HSCT. The most
frequently diagnosed neoplasms are thyroid carcinoma, brain tumors,
and epithelial cancers. Young age, male gender, use of TBI during the
preparative regimen, chronic GVHD, and an intrinsic genetic predisposition to develop cancer (Fanconi anemia) have been reported to be
risk factors for development of secondary malignancies after HSCT.
Routine physical exams, including yearly skin in exams, in those that
received TBI are important in the care of these patients.

GRAFT-­VERSUS-­HOST DISEASE

In the posttransplant period, multiple studies have shown that quality
of life is severely impacted by the presence of GVHD, which is an issue
that is also unique to HSCT (see Chapter 179).

OTHER EFFECTS

HSCT patients can also experience complications related to their pulmonary function, renal function, dental health, and gastrointestinal
system, often related to prior exposures as well as their conditioning
regimen. It is also important to note that long-­term survivors must
be monitored for psychologic issues because of their prior and current underlying health conditions. They may need extra assistance

with school and vocational attainment. These patients are also often
at higher risk for depression and anxiety; yearly psychosocial assessments can identify survivors who need additional therapy or psychotropic medication. Parents may also have posttraumatic stress from the
experience.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Certain patient populations who undergo HSCT are at increased risk
for late effects. Young children appear to be at a heightened risk for

late complications related to TBI, especially those related to growth,
thyroid function, and neurocognition. Patients with an underlying
genetic condition must also be monitored more closely for specific
consequences of therapy, such as specific secondary malignancies in
the Fanconi anemia population caused by an underlying DNA repair
defect and patients with sickle cell anemia and thalassemia who are
predisposed to iron overload.
