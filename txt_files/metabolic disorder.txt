An Approach to Inborn
Errors of Metabolism
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and
Charles P. Venditti
Many childhood conditions are caused by single-­gene pathogenic
variants that encode specific proteins. These pathogenic variants can
change the primary protein structure or the amount of protein synthesized. The function of a protein, whether it is an enzyme, receptor,
transport vehicle, membrane component, transcriptional coregulator, or structural element, may be compromised or abolished.
Hereditary diseases that disrupt normal biochemical processes are
termed inborn errors of metabolism or inherited metabolic diseases (Fig. 104.1).
Most genetic changes are clinically inconsequential and represent
benign variants. However, pathogenic variants produce diseases that
range in severity of presentation and the time of onset. Severe metabolic disorders usually become clinically apparent in the newborn
period or shortly thereafter, whereas milder forms may present later
in childhood and even in adulthood. With some exceptions, the presenting symptoms of most metabolic conditions lack the specificity
to enable a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation. The combination of low specificity of presenting symptoms and low prevalence
of metabolic disorders makes specific diagnosis difficult. Progressive symptoms, the absence of a plausible nongenetic diagnosis after
detailed evaluation, history of overlapping symptoms in a patient’s
relatives, or consanguinity should alert a pediatrician to seek a consultation with a geneticist and prompt metabolic testing early in the
evaluation.
Correct diagnosis is often only the beginning of a long medical journey for most families affected by metabolic conditions (see Chapter
95). Although each inherited metabolic disorder is individually rare,
improved diagnosis and increasing survival of patients with metabolic
conditions virtually ensure that a pediatrician will encounter and provide care to affected patients. Pediatricians can play a critical role in
establishing the continuity of care; managing some aspects of treatment; fostering adherence; and delivering routine pediatric interventions such as immunizations, referrals to specialists, and elements of
genetic counseling (see Chapter 98.1).
The greater awareness of metabolic conditions, wider availability
of biochemical laboratories, global metabolomic analysis, and routine
application of exome and genome sequencing dramatically increased
the detection rate of the known disorders and contributed to the discovery of new metabolic disorders. Nonetheless, collection and analysis of family history remain critical screening tests that a healthcare
provider can use to identify an infant or child at risk for a metabolic
disorder. The identification of consanguinity or a particular ethnic
background with an unusually high incidence of inborn errors of
metabolism can be important to direct further studies. For example,
tyrosinemia type 1 is more common among French Canadians of Quebec, maple syrup urine disease is seen with higher frequency in the U.S.
Amish population, and Canavan disease is more common in patients
of the Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

NEWBORN SCREENING

The individual rarity of inborn errors of metabolism, the importance of
early diagnosis, and the ensuing genetic counseling ramifications make
a strong argument for the universal screening of all newborn infants.
Tandem mass spectrometry of metabolites and enzyme assays form
the foundation of first-­tier newborn screening. Worldwide, newborn
screening programs have begun incorporating reflex second-­tier testing using molecular analysis of target genes. These methods require
only a few drops of blood to be placed on a filter paper and delivered
to a central laboratory for assay. Many genetic conditions can be identified by these methods, and the list of disorders continues to grow
(Tables 104.1 and 104.2). Pediatricians need to be aware of the general screening procedure and limitations of screening. As a screening
method, a positive result may require a repeat newborn screen or confirmatory testing to secure the diagnosis. The time required to return
the results varies from country to country and even within states in
the same country. Some metabolic conditions can be severe enough to
cause clinical manifestations before the results of the newborn screening become available. Conversely, diagnostic metabolites in milder
forms of screened disorders may not reach a set threshold to trigger
secondary studies, thus leading to negative newborn screen results and
delayed diagnosis. Therefore negative newborn screening in a patient
with symptoms suggestive of a metabolic disorder warrants a referral to a
genetics specialist for further evaluation.
Universal newborn screening may also identify mild forms of inherited metabolic conditions, some of which may never cause clinical
manifestations in the lifetime of the individual. For example, short-­
chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase deficiency has been identified with
unexpectedly high frequency in screening programs using tandem
mass spectrometry, but most of these children have remained asymptomatic. This highlights the need for an ongoing evaluation of metabolite cutoff values and approaches to confirmatory testing to maximize
the diagnostic yield and minimize potential psychosocial and economic implications of such findings. Premature infants represent a
special population in whom the incidence of false-­positive or false-­
negative test results can be especially high.
With the advent of genetic therapy for spinal muscular atrophy
(SMA) and enzyme replacement therapy for some lysosomal storage
diseases (e.g., Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease,
and mucopolysaccharidosis type 1), most state newborn screening programs include screening for SMA and lysosomal storage
disorders.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GENETIC
METABOLIC DISEASES

Physicians and other healthcare providers who care for children should
familiarize themselves with early manifestations of inborn errors of
metabolism, because (1) severe forms of some of these conditions may
cause symptoms before the results of screening studies become available and (2) the current screening methods, although quite extensive,
identify a small number of all inherited metabolic conditions. In the
newborn period, the clinical findings are usually nonspecific and similar to those seen in infants with sepsis. An inborn error of metabolism
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a severely ill newborn infant, and special studies should be undertaken if the index of
suspicion is high (see Fig. 104.1).
Signs and symptoms such as lethargy, hypotonia, hypothermia,
convulsions (Table 104.3), poor feeding, and vomiting may develop as
early as a few hours after birth. Occasionally, vomiting may be severe
enough to suggest the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which is usually
not present, although it may occur simultaneously in some infants.

Lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, and coma may also be seen in infants
with hypoglycemia (Table 104.4) (see Chapters 113 and 147), hypocalcemia (Chapters 69 and 611), and hyperammonemia (Table 104.5)
(Chapter 105). Measurements of blood concentrations of glucose and
calcium and prompt response to intravenous injection of glucose or
calcium help guide the diagnostic decisions.

Every organ can be affected by metabolic disorders. However,
physical examination usually reveals nonspecific findings; most signs
are related to the central nervous system such as lethargy, coma, seizures, hyperventilation, or opisthotonus. Hepatomegaly is a common
finding in a variety of inborn errors of metabolism (Table 104.6).

and fetal hydrops (Table 104.9) are additional potential manifestations of a metabolic disorder (Table 104.10). Occasionally, a peculiar odor may offer an invaluable clue leading to the right diagnosis
(Table 104.11).
In an increasing number of patients, a metabolic condition may be
recognized months or years after birth. This is more typical in patients
carrying milder autosomal recessive pathogenic variants, in mitochondrial disorders, in females affected by X-­linked recessive conditions, and specific metabolic conditions that usually present later in
life. There may be an episodic or intermittent pattern, with episodes
of acute clinical manifestations separated by periods of seemingly
disease-­free states. The episodes are usually triggered by stress or nonspecific catabolic stress such as an infection, overfeeding, prolonged
fasting, or physical exertion. Thus an inborn error of metabolism
should be considered in any child with one or more of the following
unexplained clinical manifestations: failure to thrive; coarse facial
features and reduced range of motion in the joints; developmental
delay; intellectual disability; developmental regression; motor deficits
or adventitious movements (e.g., dystonia, choreoathetosis, ataxia);
seizures; catatonia; myopathy; intermittent episodes of unexplained
vomiting, acidosis, mental deterioration, psychosis, or coma; hepatomegaly; renal stones; renal dysfunction, especially Fanconi syndrome
or renal tubular acidosis; cardiomyopathy; persistent leukopenia;
megaloblastic anemia; and unusual odor (particularly during an acute
illness) (Table 104.12).
Diagnosis usually requires a variety of specific laboratory studies.
Plasma amino acid analysis, total plasma homocysteine, plasma acylcarnitine profile, total and free carnitine levels, and urine organic acid
assay, although not exhaustive in their diagnostic scope, are useful as
initial screening tests to evaluate for a suspected inborn error of metabolism. Measurements of plasma ammonia, glucose, lactate, bicarbonate, and pH are readily available in hospitals and very helpful initially
in differentiating major causes of genetic metabolic disorders (Table
104.13 and Fig. 104.2). Elevation of blood ammonia is usually caused
by defects of urea cycle enzymes, organic acidemias, and disorders of
fatty acid oxidation. Infants with elevated blood ammonia levels from

urea cycle defects tend to have normal serum pH and bicarbonate values; without measurement of blood ammonia, they may remain undiagnosed and succumb to their disease. In organic acidemias, elevated
plasma ammonia is accompanied by severe acidosis caused by accumulation of organic acids, ketone bodies, and lactate in body fluids.
When blood ammonia, pH, and bicarbonate values are normal, other
aminoacidopathies (e.g., hyperglycinemia) or galactosemia should be
considered. Galactosemic infants may also manifest cataracts, hepatomegaly, ascites, and jaundice.
Currently, more targeted assays, such as those used with newborn
screening, have the highest sensitivity in the diagnosis or monitoring of
specific disorders in question. However, some success has been shown
in the context of undiagnosed individuals where metabolomic (assays
for entire small molecule metabolites) data can be correlated with
genomic information to provide supporting evidence for a pathogenic
variant in a suspected causal gene.

TREATMENT

Most patients with genetic disorders of metabolism respond to one or
more of the following treatments:
1.	Special diets play an important role in the treatment of affected children. Dietary changes should be tailored to the pathophysiology of
the condition and vary greatly among disorders.
2.	Hemodialysis for expeditious removal of accumulated noxious compounds. This is a very effective modality for treatment of the acute
phase of the condition.
3.	Catabolic states in patients at risk for metabolic crisis can be treated
with fluids containing dextrose and electrolytes.
4.	Administration of the deficient metabolite.
5.	Administration of the cofactor or coenzyme to maximize the residual enzyme activity.
6.	Activation of alternative pathways to reduce the noxious compounds
accumulated because of the genetic abnormality.
7.	Administration of the deficient enzyme.
8.	Bone marrow transplantation.
9.	Liver and kidney transplantation.

Chapter 105

Defects in Metabolism of
Amino Acids
105.1 Phenylalanine
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid. Dietary phenylalanine that
is not used for protein synthesis is normally degraded by way of the
tyrosine pathway (Fig. 105.1). Deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH) or one of its cofactors tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
causes accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in body fluids
and in the brain.
Elevations of phenylalanine in the plasma reflect the degree of
enzyme deficiency, presenting as a spectrum of biochemical and clinical findings. In patients with severe PAH deficiency (also referred to
as classical phenylketonuria), plasma phenylalanine levels on an unrestricted diet usually exceed 20 mg/dL (>1,200 μmol/L). Patients with
milder PAH pathogenic variants have plasma phenylalanine levels
between 10 mg/dL (600 μmol/L) and 20 mg/dL (1,200 μmol/L). Levels
between 2 and 10 mg/dL (120 and 600 μmol/L) on an unrestricted
diet are observed in patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia. In
affected infants with plasma concentrations >20 mg/dL, excess phenylalanine is metabolized to phenylketones (phenylpyruvate and
phenylacetate; see Fig. 105.1) that are excreted in the urine, giving
rise to the term phenylketonuria (PKU). These metabolites have no
known role in the mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) damage in PKU patients, but their presence in body fluids can signify the
severity of the condition. The brain is most vulnerable to the damage
incurred by PKU, but the exact mechanism of injury remains elusive. Both toxic elevations of phenylalanine and insufficient tyrosine
may play roles. Phenylalanine hydroxylase converts phenylalanine to
tyrosine, which is necessary for the production of neurotransmitters
such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine (Fig. 105.2). If
the degree of enzymatic block is severe, tyrosine becomes an essential
amino acid and may be deficient if its intake is not adequate. On the
other hand, observations that lower concentrations of phenylalanine
in plasma and brain tissue are associated with improved neurobehavioral outcomes support the view that toxic levels of phenylalanine are
key to PKU pathogenesis. High blood levels of phenylalanine can saturate the transport system across the blood-­brain barrier (BBB) and
inhibit the cerebral uptake of other large neutral amino acids such as
the branched-­chain amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, impairing
brain protein synthesis.

SEVERE PHENYLALANINE HYDROXYLASE
DEFICIENCY (CLASSIC PHENYLKETONURIA)

Elevations of plasma phenylalanine >20 mg/dL (>1,200 μmol/L), if
untreated, invariably result in the development of signs and symptoms
of classic PKU, except in uncommon and unpredictable cases.

Clinical Manifestations

The affected infant appears normal at birth. Profound intellectual
disability gradually develops if the infant remains untreated. Cognitive delay may not be evident for the first few months. In untreated
patients, 50–70% will have an IQ below 35, and 88–90% will have an
IQ below 65. Less than 5% of untreated patients attain IQ scores in the
average range. Vomiting, sometimes severe enough to be misdiagnosed
as pyloric stenosis, may be an early symptom. Older untreated children
become hyperactive and show autistic behaviors, including stereotypic
hand movements and rhythmic rocking.

Untreated and undertreated infants are lighter in their complexion
than unaffected siblings. Some may have a seborrheic or eczematoid
rash, which is usually mild and disappears with age. Affected children
have an odor of phenylacetic acid, which has been described as musty
or “mousey.” Neurologic signs include seizures (approximately 25%),
spasticity, hyperreflexia, tremors, and athetosis; >50% have electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities. Microcephaly, prominent
maxillae with widely spaced teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and growth
retardation are other common findings in untreated children. Low
bone mineral density and osteopenia have been reported in affected
individuals of all ages. Although inadequate intake of natural proteins
seems to be the major culprit, the exact pathogenesis of this sequela
remains unclear.
Long-­term care of patients with PKU is best achieved by a team of
experienced professionals (metabolic specialist, nutritionist, and psychologist), typically in a regional treatment center. The clinical manifestations of classical PKU are rarely seen in countries where neonatal
screening programs for the detection of PKU are in effect.

Non-­PKU Hyperphenylalaninemia

Implementation of universal screening for PKU led to identification of a group of infants in whom initial plasma concentrations of phenylalanine are above normal (i.e., >2 mg/dL, or 120
μmol/L) but <20 mg/dL (1,200 μmol/L). These infants typically do
not excrete phenylketones. Patients with non-­PKU hyperphenylalaninemia may still require dietary therapy, depending on their
untreated plasma phenylalanine level. Attempts have been made to
classify these patients into different subgroups depending on the
degree of hyperphenylalaninemia, but the effects of this classification on PKU management and outcomes remain to be clarified.
The possibility of deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) should
be investigated in all infants, especially those with milder forms of
hyperphenylalaninemia.

Diagnosis

Because of the gradual and nonspecific nature of early clinical symptoms such as vomiting, developmental delay, or eczematoid rash, hyperphenylalaninemia is usually diagnosed through newborn screening in
all developed countries. In infants with positive screening results, the
diagnosis should be confirmed by quantitative measurement of plasma
phenylalanine concentration and molecularly by identifying pathogenic variants in PAH. Identification and measurement of phenylketones in the urine have no place in any screening program. In countries
and places where such programs are not in effect, identification of phenylketones in the urine by ferric chloride may offer a simple test for the
diagnosis of infants with developmental and neurologic abnormalities.
All patients with a biochemical diagnosis of hyperphenylalaninemia
should undergo pterin measurements in blood or urine to evaluate for
defects in BH4 synthesis or recycling.

Neonatal Screening for Hyperphenylalaninemia

Effective and relatively inexpensive methods for mass screening
of newborn infants are used in the United States and many other
countries. A few drops of blood, which are placed on a filter paper
and mailed to a central laboratory, are used for assay. The screening method of choice uses tandem mass spectrometry, which can
identify all forms of hyperphenylalaninemia with a low false-­positive
rate and excellent accuracy and precision. The addition of the
phenylalanine:tyrosine molar ratio can improve test specificity and
reduce the number of false-­positive results. Diagnosis must be confirmed by measurement of plasma phenylalanine concentration and,
ultimately by identifying pathogenic variants in PAH. Blood phenylalanine in affected infants with PKU may rise to diagnostic levels as
early as 4 hours after birth, even in the absence of protein feeding.
However, to reduce the number of false-­negative results, especially in
the milder forms of the condition, it is recommended that the blood
for screening be obtained in the first 24-­48 hours of life after feeding
protein.

Treatment

The mainstay of treatment of PKU is a low-­phenylalanine diet. The
general consensus is to start diet treatment immediately in patients
with blood phenylalanine levels >10 mg/dL (600 μmol/L). It is recommended that infants with persistent (more than a few days) plasma
levels of phenylalanine ≥6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) should also be treated
with a phenylalanine-­restricted diet similar to that in classic PKU.
The goal of therapy is to reduce phenylalanine levels in the plasma
and brain. Formulas free of or low in phenylalanine are commercially
available. The diet should be started as soon as the diagnosis is established. Because phenylalanine is not synthesized endogenously, the
diet should provide phenylalanine to prevent phenylalanine deficiency.
Dietary phenylalanine tolerance is determined based on age and severity of the PAH deficiency. Phenylalanine deficiency is manifested by
lethargy, failure to thrive, anorexia, anemia, rashes, diarrhea, and even
death. Furthermore, tyrosine can become an essential amino acid in
this disorder, and its adequate intake must be ensured. Special food
items low in phenylalanine are commercially available for dietary treatment of affected children and adults.

There is no firm consensus concerning optimal levels of blood
phenylalanine in affected patients either across different countries or
among treatment centers in the United States. The current recommendation is to maintain blood phenylalanine levels between 2 and
6 mg/dL (120 and 360 μmol/L) throughout life. Discontinuation of
therapy, even in adulthood, may cause deterioration of neurocognitive
performance.
Lifelong adherence to a low-­phenylalanine diet is extremely difficult.
Patients who maintain good control as children but discontinue the
phenylalanine-­restricted diet as teenagers or adults may experience
significant difficulties with executive function, concentration, emotional liability, and depression. Executive dysfunction may also occur
in early-­treated children despite diet treatment.
Given the difficulty of maintaining a strict low-­phenylalanine diet,
there are continuing attempts to find other modalities for treatment of
these patients. Administration of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs)
is one approach to dietary therapy. LNAAs (tyrosine, tryptophan,
leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, histidine, and phenylalanine)
use the same transporter protein (LNAA type 1 or LAT-­1) for transit

through the intestinal cell membrane and BBB. Binding of LNAAs
to the transporter is a competitive process. Therefore when LNAAs
compete with phenylalanine at the transport level, their large concentrations in the intestinal lumen and blood can reduce the uptake of
phenylalanine into the bloodstream and the brain, respectively. Large,
controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish the efficacy of this
treatment.
Oral administration of BH4, the cofactor for PAH, may result in the
reduction of plasma phenylalanine in some patients with PAH deficiency. Plasma phenylalanine in these patients may decrease enough
to allow for considerable modification of their dietary restriction. In
very rare cases the diet may be discontinued because the phenylalanine remains under 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L). The response to BH4 cannot be predicted consistently based on the genotype alone, especially
in compound heterozygous patients. Sapropterin dihydrochloride, a
synthetic form of BH4, which acts as a cofactor in patients with residual
PAH activity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to reduce phenylalanine levels in PKU. A sustained decrease of plasma phenylalanine
by at least 30% is consistent with sapropterin responsiveness. Injectable PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia–lyase has been
approved by the FDA and EMA for adult PKU patients with uncontrolled blood phenylalanine levels greater than 600 μmol/L despite
prior management.

Pregnancy in Women with PAH Deficiency (Maternal
Phenylketonuria)

Pregnant women with PAH deficiency who are not on a phenylalanine-­
restricted diet have a very high risk of having offspring with intellectual
disability, microcephaly, growth retardation, congenital malformations, and congenital heart disease. These complications are directly
correlated with elevated maternal blood phenylalanine levels during
pregnancy. Prospective mothers who have been treated for PAH deficiency should be maintained on a phenylalanine-­restricted diet before
and during pregnancy. The best observed outcomes occur when strict
control of maternal blood phenylalanine concentration is instituted
before pregnancy. Plasma phenylalanine levels >6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L)
after conception are associated with increased incidence of intrauterine
growth restriction and congenital malformations, as well as lower performance on neurocognitive testing. However, there is strong evidence
that phenylalanine control instituted after conception can also result in
improved outcomes. The recommended phenylalanine concentration

is 2-­6 mg/dL (120-­360 μmol/L) throughout the pregnancy, although
some expert groups advocate plasma phenylalanine levels <4 mg/dL
(<240 μmol/L). All women with PAH deficiency who are of childbearing age should be counseled properly regarding the risk of congenital
anomalies in their offspring.

HYPERPHENYLALANINEMIA CAUSED
BY DEFICIENCY OF THE COFACTOR
TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN

In 1–3% of infants with hyperphenylalaninemia, the defect resides in
one of the enzymes necessary for production or recycling of the cofactor BH4 (see Fig. 105.1). If these infants are misdiagnosed as having
PKU, they may deteriorate neurologically despite adequate control of
plasma phenylalanine. BH4 is synthesized from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through several enzymatic reactions (see Fig. 105.1). In
addition to acting as a cofactor for PAH, BH4 is also a cofactor for
tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase, which are involved
in the biosynthesis of dopamine (see Fig. 105.2) and serotonin (see
Fig. 105.5), respectively. Therefore patients with hyperphenylalaninemia resulting from BH4 deficiency also manifest neurologic findings related to deficiencies of these neurotransmitters. Four enzyme
deficiencies leading to defective BH4 formation cause hyperphenylalaninemia with concomitant deficiencies of dopamine and serotonin:
autosomal recessive GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency (encoded by
GCH1), 6-­
pyruvoyl-­
tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency (encoded
by PTS), dihydropteridine reductase deficiency (encoded by QDPR),
and pterin-­4-­α-­
carbinolamine dehydratase deficiency (encoded by
PCBD1). 6-­Pyruvoyl-­tetrahydropterin synthase is the most frequent
cause of hyperphenylalaninemia-­associated BH4 deficiency. Autosomal
dominant forms of GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency and sepiapterin
reductase deficiency result in deficiencies of neurotransmitters without
hyperphenylalaninemia (see Chapter 105.11).

Clinical Manifestations

Infants with cofactor BH4 deficiency are identified during screening
programs for PKU because of hyperphenylalaninemia. Plasma phenylalanine levels may be as high as those in classic PKU or may be in the
milder range. However, clinical manifestations of the neurotransmitter
disorders differ greatly from those of PKU. Neurologic symptoms of
the neurotransmitter disorders often manifest in the first few months
of life and include extrapyramidal signs (choreoathetotic or dystonic
limb movements, axial and truncal hypotonia, hypokinesia), feeding

difficulties, and autonomic abnormalities. Intellectual disability, seizures, hypersalivation, and swallowing difficulties can also be seen.
The symptoms are usually progressive and often have a marked diurnal fluctuation. Prognosis and outcome strongly depend on the age of
diagnosis, treatment, and the underlying enzyme defect.

Diagnosis

Despite the low incidence of BH4 synthesis and recycling defects, all
newborns with hyperphenylalaninemia detected through newborn
screening must be screened for BH4 synthesis defects. BH4 deficiency
and the responsible enzyme defect may be diagnosed by several studies.

Measurement of Neopterin and Biopterin

Neopterin (an oxidative product of dihydroneopterin triphosphate)
and biopterin (an oxidative product of dihydrobiopterin and BH4) are
measured in body fluids, especially urine (see Fig. 105.1). In patients
with the autosomal recessive form of GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency,
urinary excretion of both neopterin and biopterin is reduced and is
often very low. In patients with 6-­pyruvoyl-­tetrahydropterin synthase
deficiency, there is a marked elevation of neopterin excretion and a
concomitant decrease in biopterin excretion. Patients with pterin-­4-­
α-­carbinolamine dehydratase deficiency can be identified by detecting urinary primapterin (an isomer of biopterin). In dihydropteridine
reductase deficiency, no consistent pattern in the excretion of neopterin and biopterin has been observed, thus necessitating enzymatic
studies of DHPR in erythrocytes and/or molecular confirmation
through QDPR gene analysis.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Studies

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reveal decreased levels
of dopamine and serotonin metabolites (see Chapter 105.11).

BH4 Loading Test

An oral dose of BH4 (20 mg/kg) normalizes plasma phenylalanine and
the phenylalanine:tyrosine ratio in patients with BH4-­responsive deficiency within 4-­12 hours. The baseline blood phenylalanine should
be elevated (>400 μmol/L) to enable interpretation of the results. This
may be achieved by discontinuing diet therapy for 2 days before the
test. In BH4-­responsive PAH deficiency, blood phenylalanine levels
may decrease during the BH4 loading test but increase later, even with
BH4 supplementation. Patients who demonstrate phenylalanine levels
within the normal range over at least 1 week without a phenylalanine-­
restricted diet can continue BH4 supplementation as the sole treatment
for the hyperphenylalaninemia. However, it is imperative that plasma
phenylalanine levels be monitored prospectively to ensure that phenylalanine levels remain within the normal range.

Molecular Testing

Sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis are clinically available
and have an important role in confirming the biochemical diagnosis

interfere with the transport of neurotransmitter precursors (tyrosine and tryptophan) into the brain. Plasma phenylalanine should
be maintained as close to normal as possible (<6 mg/dL or <360
μmol/L). This can be achieved by oral supplementation of BH4 (5-­
20 mg/kg/day). Sapropterin dihydrochloride, the synthetic form of
BH4, is commercially available but expensive. In patients receiving
dietary interventions, phenylalanine and tyrosine deficiencies should
be avoided.
Lifelong supplementation with neurotransmitter precursors such
as l-­dopa and 5-­hydroxytryptophan, along with carbidopa to inhibit
degradation of l-­dopa before it enters the CNS, is necessary in most of
these patients even when treatment with BH4 normalizes plasma levels
of phenylalanine. BH4 does not readily enter the brain to restore neurotransmitter production. To minimize untoward side effects (especially l-­dopa–induced dyskinesia), the treatment should be started
with low doses of l-­dopa/carbidopa and 5-­hydroxytryptophan. The
treatment should be gradually adjusted based on response to therapy
and clinical improvement for each individual patient. Supplementation
with folinic acid is also recommended in patients with dihydropteridine reductase deficiency. Unfortunately, attempting to normalize neurotransmitter levels using neurotransmitter precursors usually does
not fully resolve the neurologic symptoms because of the inability to
attain normal levels of BH4 in the brain. Patients often demonstrate
intellectual disability, fluctuating abnormalities of tone, eye movement
abnormalities, poor balance and coordination, decreased ability to
ambulate, and seizures despite supplementation with neurotransmitter
precursors.
Hyperprolactinemia occurs in patients with BH4 deficiency and
may be the result of hypothalamic dopamine deficiency. Measurement
of serum prolactin levels may be a convenient method for monitoring
adequacy of neurotransmitter replacement in affected patients.
Some drugs, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, methotrexate,
and other antileukemic agents, are known to inhibit dihydropteridine
reductase enzyme activity and should be used with great caution in
patients with BH4 deficiency.

Genetics and Prevalence

All defects causing hyperphenylalaninemia are inherited as autosomal
recessive traits. Autosomal dominant forms of GTP cyclohydrolase I
deficiency and sepiapterin reductase deficiency result in neurotransmitter disorders without hyperphenylalaninemia (see Chapter 105.11).
The prevalence of PKU in the United States is estimated at 1 in 14,000
to 1 in 20,000 live births. The prevalence of non-­PKU hyperphenylalaninemia is estimated at 1 in 50,000 live births. Most patients are compound heterozygotes for two different pathogenic variants.

Enzyme Assay

The activity of dihydropteridine reductase can be measured in the
dry blood spots on the filter paper used for screening purposes or in
erythrocytes. 6-­
Pyruvoyl-­
tetrahydropterin synthase activity can be
measured in liver tissue, fibroblasts, and erythrocytes. Pterin-­4-­α-­
carbinolamine dehydratase activity can be measured in liver tissue and
fibroblasts. GTP cyclohydrolase I activity can be measured in the liver
and in cytokine (interferon-­γ)–stimulated mononuclear cells or fibroblasts (the enzyme activity is normally very low in unstimulated cells).
Molecular testing offers a more convenient method to secure the diagnosis in this group of disorders.

Treatment

The goals of therapy are to correct hyperphenylalaninemia and to
restore neurotransmitter deficiencies in the CNS. Control of hyperphenylalaninemia is important in patients with cofactor deficiency
because high levels of phenylalanine cause intellectual disability and

105.2 Tyrosine
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Tyrosine is derived from ingested proteins or is synthesized endogenously from phenylalanine. It is used for protein synthesis and as a precursor of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, melanin, thyroxine,
and quinoproteins. Excess tyrosine is metabolized to carbon dioxide
and water through the tyrosine degradation pathway (see Fig. 105.1).
Hereditary causes of hypertyrosinemia include deficiencies of the
enzymes fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), and 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4-­HPPD).
Acquired hypertyrosinemia may occur in severe hepatocellular dysfunction (liver failure), scurvy (vitamin C is a cofactor for 4-­HPPD),
and hyperthyroidism. Hypertyrosinemia is common in blood samples
obtained soon after eating and in premature infants.

816 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
TYROSINEMIA TYPE I (FUMARYLACETOACETATE
HYDROLASE DEFICIENCY, HEPATORENAL
TYROSINEMIA)

Tyrosinemia type I is a severe multisystemic disease caused by FAH
deficiency. Liver, kidney, and nerve damage is likely caused by metabolites of tyrosine degradation, especially fumarylacetoacetate and
succinylacetone.

Clinical Manifestations and Natural History

Affected infants may appear healthy at birth but develop symptoms in
the first year of life. Most patients present between 2 and 6 months of
age but rarely may become symptomatic in the first month or appear
unaffected beyond the first year of life. Earlier presentation confers poorer prognosis. In untreated children, a 1-­year mortality can
approach 60% if infants develop symptoms before 2 months of age and
decrease to 4% in infants who become symptomatic after 6 months.
An acute hepatic crisis typically heralds the disease onset and is
usually precipitated by an intercurrent illness leading to a catabolic
state. Fever, irritability, vomiting, hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, jaundice,
elevated levels of serum transaminases, hypoglycemia, and neuropathy are common. An odor resembling boiled cabbage resulting from
increased methionine metabolites may be present. Without treatment,
hepatic crises may progress to liver failure and death. Between the crises, varying degrees of failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and coagulation
abnormalities often persist. Cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular
carcinoma occur with increasing age.
Episodes of acute peripheral neuropathy resembling acute porphyria occur in approximately 40% of affected children. These crises,
often triggered by a minor infection, are characterized by severe pain,
often in the legs, associated with extensor hypertonia of the neck and
trunk, vomiting, paralytic ileus, and occasionally self-­induced injuries
of the tongue or buccal mucosa. Marked weakness occurs in about 30%
of episodes, which may lead to respiratory failure requiring mechanical
ventilation. Crises typically last 1-­7 days, but recuperation from paralytic crises can take weeks to months.
Renal involvement manifests as a Fanconi renal syndrome with
hyperphosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, normal–anion gap metabolic
acidosis, and vitamin D–resistant rickets. Nephromegaly and nephrocalcinosis may be present on ultrasound examination. Glomerular
abnormalities can be observed in adolescents and older patients.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hyperinsulinism are seen in
some infants.

Laboratory Findings

Elevated levels of succinylacetone in serum and urine are diagnostic
for tyrosinemia type I (see Fig. 105.1). Succinylacetone levels may fall
below the diagnostic threshold in patients treated with nitisinone. In
untreated patients, serum α-­fetoprotein is increased, often greatly, and
liver-­synthesized coagulation factors are decreased in most patients.
Increased levels of α-­fetoprotein are present in the cord blood of
affected infants, indicating liver damage beginning prenatally. Serum
transaminase levels are often increased, with marked increases during acute hepatic episodes. Serum concentration of bilirubin is usually normal but can be increased in severe liver failure. Plasma tyrosine
levels are usually elevated at diagnosis, but this is a nonspecific finding and can vary depending on dietary intake. Plasma levels of other
amino acids, particularly methionine, may also be elevated in patients
with liver damage. Hyperphosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, and generalized aminoaciduria may occur. Urinary 5-­aminolevulinic acid (also
known as delta-­aminolevulinic acid) is elevated due to the inhibition
of 5-­aminolevulinate dehydratase by succinylacetone (see Fig. 112.1).
Diagnosis is usually established by demonstration of elevated succinylacetone in urine or blood. Neonatal screening for hypertyrosinemia
using tyrosine alone detects only a fraction of patients with tyrosinemia
type I. Succinylacetone assayed by many neonatal screening programs
has higher sensitivity and specificity than tyrosine and is the preferred
metabolite for screening. Tyrosinemia type I should be differentiated
from other causes of hepatitis and hepatic failure in infants, including galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, neonatal iron storage

disease, giant cell hepatitis, citrullinemia type II, citrin deficiency, and
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (see Chapter 105.12).

Treatment and Outcome

A diet low in phenylalanine and tyrosine can slow, but not halt, the
progression of the condition. The treatment of choice is nitisinone
(NTBC), which inhibits 4-­HPPD, reduces the flux of tyrosine metabolites to FAH, and decreases the production of the offending compounds
fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone (see Fig. 105.1). The dose of
nitisinone is titrated to the lowest, most effective dose (usually targeting
the blood range of 20-­40 μmol/L), aiming to suppress succinylacetone
production while maintaining a plasma tyrosine level <400 μmol/L
(7.2 mg/dL). This treatment with nitisinone can prevent acute hepatic
and neurologic crises. Although nitisinone greatly slows disease progression, pretreatment liver damage cannot be completely reversed.
Therefore patients must be followed for the development of cirrhosis
or hepatocellular carcinoma. On imaging, the presence of even a single
liver nodule usually indicates underlying cirrhosis. Most liver nodules
in FAH-­deficient patients are benign, but current imaging techniques
cannot accurately distinguish all malignant nodules. For patients with
severe liver failure not responding to nitisinone, liver transplantation is
an effective therapy, which can also alleviate the risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma. The impact of nitisinone treatment on liver transplantation
is under study, but the greatest positive effect is seen in patients treated
early, such as children detected by neonatal screening, before developing clinical symptoms. In early-­treated patients, nitisinone has greatly
reduced the need for liver transplantation. Because nitisinone treatment can increase plasma tyrosine, a low-­tyrosine, low-­phenylalanine
diet is recommended. Rarely, nitisinone-­treated patients develop corneal crystals, presumably composed of tyrosine, but these tend to be
reversible with strict dietary compliance. This finding, combined with
observations of developmental delay in some patients with tyrosinemia
type II who chronically have elevated tyrosine levels, suggest that a diet
low in phenylalanine and tyrosine should be continued in patients
treated with nitisinone. The dietary treatment of patients with tyrosine
and phenylalanine restriction necessitates surveillance of growth and
development by ensuring adequate intake of amino acids and other
nutrients.

Genetics and Prevalence

Tyrosinemia type I is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and is
caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in FAH. DNA analysis is useful for carrier testing in groups at risk for specific pathogenic variants,
such as French Canadians from the Saguenay-­Lac Saint-­Jean region of
Quebec. The prevalence of tyrosinemia type I is estimated to be 1 in
1,846 live births in the Saguenay-­Lac Saint-­Jean region and approximately 1 in 100,000 live births worldwide. Prenatal screening can be
performed by measurement of succinylacetone in amniotic fluid.

TYROSINEMIA TYPE II (TYROSINE AMINOTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY, RICHNER-­HANHART
SYNDROME, OCULOCUTANEOUS TYROSINEMIA)

Tyrosinemia type II is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by
deficiency of cytosolic tyrosine aminotransferase that results in palmar
and plantar hyperkeratosis, herpetiform corneal ulcers, and intellectual
disability (see Fig. 105.1). Ocular manifestations, which may occur as
early as 6 months of age, include excessive tearing, redness, pain, and
photophobia. Corneal lesions are presumed to be caused by tyrosine
crystals deposition. In contrast to herpetic ulcers, corneal lesions in
tyrosinemia type II stain poorly with fluorescein and often are bilateral.
Skin lesions, which may develop later in life, include painful, nonpruritic hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles, palms, and fingertips. Intellectual disability, which occurs in approximately 50% of patients, is
usually mild to moderate. The contribution of consanguinity in this
rare disorder is incompletely understood.
The principal laboratory finding in untreated patients is marked
hypertyrosinemia, >500 μmol/L, and it may reach 1,100-­2,750 μmol/L.
Surprisingly, in some patients urinary 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid
and its metabolites can be elevated despite them being downstream

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
from the metabolic block (see Fig. 105.1). It is hypothesized that other
transaminases in the presence of high tyrosine concentrations can produce 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid in mitochondria, where it cannot
be further degraded. In contrast to tyrosinemia type I, liver and kidney function tend to be normal, as are serum concentrations of other
amino acids and succinylacetone. Tyrosinemia type II is caused by
tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene pathogenic variants, causing a
deficiency of cytosolic TAT activity in the liver.
Diagnosis of type II tyrosinemia is established by an assay of plasma
tyrosine concentration in patients with suggestive findings and can be
confirmed molecularly. An assay of hepatic TAT requires a liver biopsy
and is rarely indicated.
Treatment with a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine, aiming to
achieve plasma tyrosine levels <500 μmol/L, helps improve skin and
eye manifestations. Early dietary intervention can lead to improved
intellectual outcomes.

TYROSINEMIA TYPE III (PRIMARY DEFICIENCY OF
4-­HYDROXYPHENYLPYRUVATE DIOXYGENASE)

Tyrosinemia type III is an autosomal recessive condition caused by
biallelic pathogenic variants in HPD encoding the enzyme 4-­HPPD.
Only a few patients with tyrosinemia type III have been reported. Most
were detected by amino acid chromatography performed for various
neurologic findings. Therefore ascertainment bias likely confounds
current understanding of this disorder. Some asymptomatic infants
with 4-­HPPD deficiency have been identified by neonatal screening
for hypertyrosinemia. Age at presentation varied between 1 and 17
months. In symptomatic patients, developmental delay, seizures, intermittent ataxia, and self-­injurious behavior have been reported. Liver
and renal abnormalities tend to be absent.
The role of 4-­HPPD deficiency in the disease needs further study. The
diagnosis is suspected in children with sustained moderate increases in
plasma levels of tyrosine (typically 350-­700 μmol/L on a normal diet)
and the presence of 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and its metabolites,
urinary 4-­hydroxyphenyllactate and 4-­hydroxyphenylacetate. The diagnosis should be confirmed by demonstrating biallelic pathogenic variants in HPD or, rarely, by demonstrating a low activity of the 4-­HPPD
enzyme. The latter requires a liver biopsy and is not usually indicated.
Given a possible association with neurologic abnormalities and corneal deposition of tyrosine crystals, dietary control of plasma tyrosine
levels is recommended. One could also consider a trial with vitamin
C, the cofactor for 4-­HPPD, which can help lower plasma tyrosine in
some patients.

HAWKINSINURIA

Hawkinsinuria is a condition allelic to tyrosinemia type III (4-­HPPD
deficiency). Some specific missense variants (e.g., p.Ala33Thr or
p.Asn241Ser) in HPD that encode 4-­HPPD can result in uncoupling
of typical oxidization of 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic
acid and lead to premature release of quinolacetic acid. The abnormal
enzyme, incapable of normally oxidizing 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvate to
homogentisic acid, forms an intermediate that reacts with glutathione
to form the unusual organic acid hawkinsin ([2-­l-­cystein-­S-­yl-­1,4-­dih
ydroxycyclohex-­5-­en-­1-­yl]acetic acid, see Fig. 105.1). As a result, secondary glutathione deficiency may ensue. Hawkinsinuria is inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait. In one patient, compound heterozygosity for alleles associated with hawkinsinuria and tyrosinemia type
III produced biochemical features of hawkinsinuria.
The clinical course of this rare disorder is incompletely understood.
Individuals with hawkinsinuria may present with symptoms only during infancy. The symptoms usually appear in the first few months of
life, typically after weaning from breastfeeding and with the introduction of a high-­protein diet. Severe metabolic acidosis, ketosis, failure
to thrive, anemia, mild hepatomegaly, renal tubular acidosis, and an
unusual odor are reported manifestations of this disorder. Neurocognitive development is usually normal.
Symptomatic infants and asymptomatic affected children and
adults excrete hawkinsin, 4-­hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and its metabolites (4-­
hydroxyphenyllactate and 4-­
hydroxyphenylacetate) as well

817

as 4-­hydroxycyclohexylacetate and 5-­oxoproline (due to secondary
glutathione deficiency) in their urine. Plasma tyrosine is moderately
elevated in symptomatic infants and may normalize in asymptomatic
older patients.
Treatment consists of a low-­protein diet during infancy. Breastfeeding is encouraged. Successful long-­term use of N-­acetyl-­l-­cysteine to
treat secondary glutathione deficiency has been reported. A trial with
vitamin C is recommended. Although the affected enzyme is susceptible to inhibition by nitisinone, clinical studies showing its efficacy in
symptomatic infants are lacking, and the indications for its use are not
known.

TRANSIENT TYROSINEMIA OF THE NEWBORN

In a small number of newborn infants, plasma tyrosine may be as high
as 3,300 μmol/L during the first 2 weeks of life. Most affected infants
are premature and are on a high-­protein diet. Transient tyrosinemia is
thought to result from delayed maturation of 4-­HPPD (see Fig. 105.1).
Lethargy, poor feeding, and decreased motor activity are noted in some
patients. Most are asymptomatic and are identified by a high blood phenylalanine or tyrosine level on routine newborn screening. Laboratory
findings include marked elevation of plasma tyrosine with a moderate increase in plasma phenylalanine. The finding of hypertyrosinemia
differentiates this condition from PKU. 4-­Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid
and its metabolites are present in the urine. Hypertyrosinemia tends to
resolve spontaneously in the first 2 months of life and can be improved
by reducing dietary protein to below 2 g/kg/day and by administering
vitamin C. Mild intellectual deficits have been reported in some infants
who had this condition, but the causal relationship to hypertyrosinemia has not been conclusively established.

ALKAPTONURIA

Alkaptonuria is a rare (approximately 1 in 250,000 live births) autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of homogentisate
1,2-­dioxigenase encoded by HGD. Large amounts of homogentisic acid
are formed (see Fig. 105.1) and excreted in urine or deposited in tissues. Alkaptonuria has a worldwide distribution, with a higher disease
prevalence in the Dominican Republic and Slovakia.
The main clinical manifestations of alkaptonuria consist of ochronosis and arthritis in adulthood. The only sign in children is blackening of
the urine on standing, caused by oxidation and polymerization of homogentisic acid. A history of gray-­or black-­stained diapers should suggest
the diagnosis. This sign may never be noted, thus delaying the diagnosis
until adulthood. Ochronosis, seen clinically as dark spots on the sclera
or ear cartilage, results from the accumulation of the black polymer of
homogentisic acid. Arthritis is another result of this deposition and can
be disabling with advancing age. It can involve the spine and large joints
(shoulders, hips, and knees) and is usually more severe in males. As with
rheumatoid arthritis, the alkaptonuric arthritis has acute exacerbations,
but its radiologic findings are more typical of osteoarthritis, with characteristic narrowing of the joint spaces and calcification of the intervertebral disks. A high incidence of heart disease (mitral and aortic valvulitis,
calcification of heart valves, myocardial infarction) has been reported.
The diagnosis is confirmed by finding massive excretion of homogentisic acid on urine organic acid testing. Tyrosine levels are normal.
The enzyme is expressed in high levels only in the liver and kidneys.
Treatment of the arthritis is symptomatic. In clinical trials, nitisinone, an inhibitor of 4-­HPPD, has been shown to reduce urinary
homogentisic acid. Additional studies are needed to establish its clinical efficacy and safety profile.

originate from the embryonic neural crest and migrate to the skin,
eyes (choroid and iris), hair follicles, and inner ear. The melanin in
the eye is confined to the iris stromal and retinal pigment epithelia,
whereas in skin and hair follicles, it is secreted into the epidermis
and hair shaft. Albinism can be caused by deficiencies of melanin
synthesis, by some hereditary defects of melanosomes, or by disorders of melanocyte migration. Neither the biosynthetic pathway of
melanin nor many facets of melanocyte cell biology are completely
elucidated (see Fig. 105.2). The end products are two pigments: pheomelanin, which is a yellow-­red pigment, and eumelanin, a brown-­
black pigment.
Clinically, primary albinism can be generalized or localized. Primary
generalized albinism can be ocular or oculocutaneous. Some syndromes
feature albinism in association with platelet, immunologic, or neurologic dysfunction. In generalized oculocutaneous albinism, hypopigmentation can be either complete or partial. Individuals with complete
albinism do not develop either generalized (tanning) or localized (pigmented nevi) skin pigmentation.
The diagnosis of albinism is usually evident, but for some children
whose families are particularly light-­skinned, normal variation may be
a diagnostic consideration. Unlike patients with albinism, unaffected
fair-­skinned children progressively develop pigmentation with age, do
not exhibit the eye manifestations of albinism, and have pigmentary
development similar to other family members. The clinical diagnosis
of oculocutaneous albinism, as opposed to other types of cutaneous
hypopigmentation, requires the presence of characteristic eye findings.
The ocular manifestations of albinism include hypopigmentation
of the iris and retina, often with foveal hypoplasia, along with reduced
visual acuity, refractive errors, nystagmus, alternating strabismus, and
iris transillumination (diffuse reddish hue of the iris produced during
ophthalmoscopic or slit-­lamp examination of the eye).

Albinism is also associated with an abnormality in routing optic fibers
at the chiasm. Unlike in pigmented individuals, in patients with albinism,
the majority of nerve fibers from the temporal side of the retina cross to
the contralateral hemisphere of the brain. This results in impaired depth
perception, alternating strabismus, and a characteristic pattern of visual
evoked potentials. These findings are highly specific for albinism. Regular
ophthalmologic follow-­up is recommended for patients with oculocutaneous albinism. Correction of refractive errors can maximize visual function.
Usually, the alternating strabismus does not result in amblyopia and does
not require surgery.
Patients with albinism should be counseled to avoid ultraviolet (UV)
radiation by wearing protective long-­sleeved clothing and by using
sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating >30. Melanin is
also present in the cochlea; therefore albino individuals may be more
susceptible to ototoxic agents such as gentamicin.

Genetics of Albinism

Oculocutaneous albinism is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Many
clinical forms of albinism have been identified. Some of the seemingly distinct clinical forms are caused by different pathogenic variants of the same
gene. Implicated genes are involved in different stages of melanogenesis
and melanosome maturation (see Table 105.1). The classification outlined
next is based on the distribution of albinism in the body and the affected
genes. Genetic analysis is clinically available for most forms of albinism
(see Table 105.1). Molecular diagnosis is of little use therapeutically in isolated albinism but can be helpful for precise genetic counseling of families.

Oculocutaneous (Generalized) Albinism

Lack of pigment is generalized, affecting skin, hair, and eyes. At least
eight genetically distinct forms of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA)
have been identified of which seven have pathogenic variants in

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
associated genes (OCA1, OCA2, OCA3, OCA4, OCA6, OCA7, and
OCA8). Many forms of OCA may not be clinically distinguishable
from one another. All affected individuals have ocular manifestations
of albinism. All known forms of OCA are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.

OCA1

The defect in patients with OCA1 resides in the tyrosinase gene, TYR.
Many pathogenic variants have been identified. Most affected individuals are compound heterozygotes. A clinical clue to the diagnosis
of OCA1 is complete lack of pigment at birth. The condition can be
subdivided into OCA1A and OCA1B, based on enzyme activity and
difference in clinical manifestations as a function of age. In patients
with OCA1A, the most severe form of OCA, both TYR alleles have
pathogenic variants that completely inactivate tyrosinase. Clinically,
lack of pigment in the skin (milky white), hair (white hair), and eyes
(red-­gray irides) is evident at birth and remains unchanged throughout
life. They do not tan and do not develop pigmented nevi or freckles.
Patients with OCA1B have TYR gene pathogenic variants that preserve some residual activity. Clinically, they completely lack pigment
at birth but with age become light blond with light-­blue or hazel eyes.
They develop pigmented nevi and freckles, and they may tan.

OCA2

OCA2 is the most common form of generalized OCA, particularly in
patients of African ancestry. Clinically, the phenotype is highly variable; most patients demonstrate some pigmentation of the skin and
eyes at birth and continue to accumulate pigment throughout life. The
hair is yellow at birth and may darken with age. They have pigmented
nevi and freckles, and some may tan. They may be clinically indistinguishable from OCA1B patients. Individuals with OCA2, however,
have normal tyrosinase activity in hair bulbs. The defect is in the OCA2
gene, which is an orthologue of the p (pink-­eyed dilution) gene in the
mouse. This gene produces the P protein, a melanosome membrane–
bound protein. Patients with Prader-­Willi and Angelman syndromes
caused by microdeletion of chromosome 15q12 that includes the OCA2
gene have mild pigmentary deficiency (see Chapter 98.8).

OCA3

This form has been identified predominantly in patients of African
and Asian ancestry. Patients with OCA3 can make pheomelanin but
not eumelanin. Patients have reddish hair and reddish-­brown skin
as adults. The skin color is peculiar to this form. In young persons
the coloration may resemble that of OCA2. The altered gene TYRP1
encodes the tyrosinase-­related protein 1, the function of which is not
well-­understood.

OCA4

Similar manifestations to OCA2 (both in the skin and the eyes) have
been observed in OCA4 patients (mostly from Japan) with pathogenic
variants in the SLC45A2 gene.

Ocular Albinism

Patients with ocular albinism (OA) present in the first months of life
with nystagmus, hypopigmentation of the iris and fundus, foveal hypoplasia, and decreased visual acuity. Electron microscopy demonstrates
characteristic macromelanosomes in skin biopsies or hair root specimens. Most patients affected by OA have ocular albinism type 1 (OA1),
an X-­linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GPR143
gene. A rare form of OA with late-­onset sensorineural deafness and
apparent autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported.

Ocular Albinism Type 1 (Nettleship-­Falls Ocular
Albinism)

OA1 is an X-­linked disorder characterized by congenital nystagmus,
reduced pigmentation of ocular structures, and visual impairment in
affected males. Heterozygous females may present with segments of
abnormal retinal pigmentations. Infrequently, depending on the pattern of X chromosome inactivation, heterozygous females may also

819

present with severe manifestations, including nystagmus, iris and
foveal hypopigmentation, foveal hypoplasia, and reduced visual acuity.
In families with darker skin complexion, mild skin hypopigmentation
can be seen. The diagnosis of OA1 is suspected in males with features
of albinism in the eye, normal to mildly reduced skin pigmentation,
and a family history suggestive of an X-­linked transmission. It is a nonprogressive disorder, and the eye findings often improve with age. In
patients who are the first of their families to be affected, genetic analysis
of GPR143 helps confirm the diagnosis.

This group of autosomal recessive disorders is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in one of ten genes (HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5,
HPS6, DTNBP1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S6, AP3D1). Hermansky-­Pudlak
syndrome (HPS) can be suspected in patients with albinism associated
with a bleeding diathesis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and/or
pulmonary fibrosis. Disease subtype can be established with molecular studies (see Chapter 533). Genes associated with HPS are required
for normal structure and function of lysosome-­derived organelles,
including melanosomes and platelet-­dense bodies. Patients have a
tyrosinase-­positive OCA of variable severity associated with platelet
dysfunction (caused by the absence of platelet-­dense bodies). A ceroid-­
like material accumulates in tissues. HPS is pan-­ethnic. Patient ancestry can help develop a cost-­effective testing strategy. HPS is prevalent
in two regions of Puerto Rico (type 1 in the northwest and type 3 in
the central regions because of different founder effects). The cutaneous and ocular symptoms of albinism are present. Patients can develop
epistaxis, postsurgical bleeding, or abundant menses. Bleeding time is
prolonged, but platelet count is normal. Major complications include
progressive pulmonary fibrosis in young adults and Crohn’s-­like IBD
in adolescents and young adults. Kidney failure and cardiomyopathy
have been reported. Neutropenia has been described in HPS type 2.
Treatment is symptomatic.

Chédiak-­Higashi Syndrome

Patients with this rare autosomal recessive condition have OCA of variable severity and susceptibility to infection (see Chapter 156). Bacterial infections of the skin and the upper respiratory tract are common.
Giant peroxidase-­positive lysosomal granules can be seen in granulocytes in a blood smear. Patients have a reduced number of melanosomes, which are abnormally large (macromelanosomes) and can have
silvery-­gray hair. The bleeding tendency is typically mild. If treatment
is not successful, children can reach a stage of the disease known as
the accelerated phase, which is a major, life-­threatening complication
of Chédiak-­Higashi syndrome. It is caused by macrophage activation
resulting in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with manifestations
that include fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia,
and an elevated plasma ferritin level. Patients surviving childhood
may develop cerebellar atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive
delay. Pathogenic variants in LYST are the only known cause for this
syndrome. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers an effective
approach to control immunodeficiency and hematologic abnormalities
and to prevent development of the accelerated phase.

Other Disorders Featuring Generalized Albinism

Hypopigmentation can be a feature in other syndromes, some with
abnormalities of lysosomal biogenesis or melanosome biology. Griscelli
syndrome patients have silver-­gray hair, pigmentary dilution of skin,
and melanosomal clumping in hair shafts and the center of melanocytes,
with intellectual disability or macrophage activation with hemophagocytosis in different subtypes. All forms are autosomal recessive caused
by pathogenic variants in MLPH, MYO5A, or RAB27A. Vici syndrome
patients have combined immunodeficiency, intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cataracts, and cleft lip/palate. It is autosomal
recessive, caused by pathogenic variants in EPG5. Patients with MAPBP-­
interacting protein deficiency have a short stature, recurrent infections,
and neutropenia, and inheritance occurs in an autosomal recessive manner due to pathogenic variants in the gene LAMTOR2.

820 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Localized Albinism

Localized albinism refers to localized patches of hypopigmentation
of skin and hair, which may be evident at birth or develop with time.
These conditions are caused by abnormal migration of melanocytes
during embryonic development.

Piebaldism

Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant inherited condition in which the
individual is usually born with a white forelock. The underlying skin is
depigmented and devoid of melanocytes. In addition, there are usually
white macules on the face, trunk, and extremities. Pathogenic variants
in the KIT and SNAI2 genes have been identified in affected patients.

Waardenburg Syndrome

In Waardenburg syndrome, a white forelock is often associated with lateral displacement of the inner canthi of the eyes, a broad nasal bridge,
heterochromia of irides, and sensorineural deafness. This condition
is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with four main subtypes
known. Patients with Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS1, the most
common form) have all the previous clinical findings, including lateral
displacement of the inner canthi. The condition is typically caused by
pathogenic variants (>90%) in the PAX3 gene. Patients with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) have the clinical findings of WS1 except
for the lateral displacement of the inner canthi. Genetically, this is a
heterogeneous condition caused by pathogenic variants in several
genes, including MITF, SOX10, and SNAI2. Patients with Waardenburg syndrome type 3 (WS3) have all the findings seen in individuals with WS1 plus hypoplasia and contractures of the upper limbs. It
is caused by heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic variants of the
PAX3 gene. Finally, Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4), associated
with Hirschsprung disease, is genetically heterogeneous, with pathogenic variants in different genes (EDN3, EDNRB, or SOX10) identified.
Other causes of localized hypopigmentation include vitiligo and
hypomelanosis of Ito (see Chapter 694).

105.3 Methionine
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
The usual pathway for catabolism of methionine, an essential amino
acid, produces S-­adenosylmethionine, which serves as a methyl group
donor for methylation reactions for a variety of compounds, and cysteine, which is formed through a series of reactions collectively called
trans-­sulfuration (Fig. 105.3).

HOMOCYSTINURIA (HOMOCYSTINEMIA)

Normally, most homocysteine, an intermediate compound of methionine degradation, is remethylated to methionine. This methionine-­
sparing reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase,
which requires a metabolite of folic acid (5-­methyltetrahydrofolate) as
a methyl donor and a metabolite of vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) as a
cofactor (see Fig. 105.3). In healthy individuals, most plasma homocysteine is either protein-­bound or exists as disulfides. Three major forms
of homocystinemia and homocystinuria have been identified.

Homocystinuria Caused by Cystathionine β-­Synthase
Deficiency (Classic Homocystinuria)

Classic homocystinuria is the most common inborn error of methionine metabolism. It is an autosomal recessive condition caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in CBS encoding cystathionine β-­synthase.
Clinical presentation in the first years of life is nonspecific. Universal newborn screening to detect elevated methionine in dried blood
spot samples can identify most affected infants. Second-­tier testing
after a positive newborn screen result should include plasma methionine and total plasma homocysteine and followed up by confirmatory
testing using CBS molecular gene analysis. Most affected patients are

compound heterozygotes for two different alleles. Heterozygous carriers are asymptomatic.
Infants with classic homocystinuria appear healthy at birth. Clinical
manifestations during infancy are nonspecific and may include failure to thrive and developmental delay. Without newborn screening,
the diagnosis can be delayed and is usually made after 3 years of age,
when subluxation of the ocular lens (ectopia lentis) occurs. This causes
severe myopia and iridodonesis (quivering of the iris). Astigmatism,
glaucoma, staphyloma, cataracts, retinal detachment, and optic atrophy may develop later in life. Progressive intellectual disability is common. Neurocognitive scores in the average range have been reported;
IQ scores range from 10 to 135. Higher IQ scores are seen in vitamin
B6–responsive patients. Psychiatric and behavioral disorders have been
observed in more than 50% of affected patients. Seizures are seen in
approximately 20% of untreated patients. Affected individuals with
homocystinuria manifest skeletal abnormalities resembling those of
Marfan syndrome (see Chapter 743): tall with elongated limbs and
arachnodactyly. Scoliosis, pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum, genu
valgum, pes cavus, high-­arched palate, and crowding of the teeth have
been reported. These children usually have a fair complexion, blue eyes,
and a peculiar malar flush. Generalized osteoporosis, especially of the
spine, is the main x-­ray finding. Thromboembolic episodes involving
both large and small vessels, especially those of the brain, are common
and may occur at any age. Optic atrophy, paralysis, cor pulmonale,
and severe hypertension (from renal infarcts) are among the serious
consequences of thromboembolism, which is likely caused by elevated
homocysteine levels leading to abnormal angiogenesis and inhibition
of fibrinolytic activity. The risk of thromboembolism increases after
surgical procedures or dehydration. Spontaneous pneumothorax and
acute pancreatitis are rare complications.
Elevations of both total plasma homocysteine and methionine in
body fluids are the diagnostic laboratory findings. Cysteine is low or
absent in plasma. Total plasma homocysteine is the preferred analyte
for screening and management of classic homocystinuria. Free plasma
homocysteine may normalize or remain normal when total plasma
homocysteine is lowered. If urinary homocystine is used for diagnostic purposes, a freshly voided urine sample is preferred because this
compound is unstable and may disappear after prolonged storage. The
diagnosis may be established by molecular analysis of CBS. Prenatal
diagnosis is feasible by DNA analysis or by performing an enzyme
assay of cultured amniotic cells.
Treatment with high doses of vitamin B6 (100-­200 mg/day) can produce significant improvement in patients who are responsive to this
therapy. Approximately 40% of affected patients respond to high doses
of vitamin B6 and usually have milder clinical manifestations than those
who are unresponsive to vitamin B6 therapy. The degree of response to
vitamin B6 treatment may vary across families. Some patients may not
respond because of folate depletion; a patient should not be considered unresponsive to vitamin B6 until folic acid (1-­5 mg/day) has been
added to the treatment regimen. For patients who are unresponsive
to vitamin B6, lifelong restriction of methionine intake in conjunction with cysteine supplementation is also recommended. The need
for dietary restriction and its extent remains controversial in patients
with the vitamin B6–responsive form. In some patients with this form,
addition of betaine may obviate the need for any dietary restriction.
Betaine (trimethylglycine, 6 g/day for adults or 100-­200 mg/kg/day
for children) lowers homocysteine levels in body fluids by remethylating homocysteine to methionine (see Fig. 105.3), which may result
in elevation of plasma methionine levels. This treatment has produced
clinical improvement (preventing vascular events) in patients who are
unresponsive to vitamin B6 therapy. Cerebral edema has occurred in
a patient with vitamin B6–nonresponsive homocystinuria and dietary
noncompliance during betaine therapy.
More than 100 pregnancies in women with classic homocystinuria
have been reported with favorable outcomes for both mothers and
infants. The majority of infants were full-­term and healthy at birth.
Postpartum thromboembolic events occurred in a few mothers.
The screening of newborn infants for classic homocystinuria has
been performed worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in

200,000 to 1 in 350,000 live births, although it can be more common
in some parts of the world (e.g., 1 in 1,800 in Qatar). Early treatment
of patients identified by screening has produced favorable results. The
mean IQ of patients with the vitamin B6–unresponsive form treated in
early infancy was in the normal range. Dislocation of the lens appeared
to be preventable in some patients.

Homocystinuria Caused by Defects in
Methylcobalamin Formation

Methylcobalamin is the cofactor for methionine synthase, which catalyzes remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. At least seven distinct defects in the intracellular metabolism of cobalamin may interfere
with the formation of methylcobalamin (for a more detailed discussion
on cobalamin metabolism, see Chapter 105.6 and Figs. 105.3 and 105.4).
The seven defects are designated as cblC, cblD (including cblD variant 1),
cblE (methionine synthase reductase), cblG (methionine synthase), cblF,
cblJ, and cblX. Patients with cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ, and cblX defects have
methylmalonic acidemia in addition to homocystinuria, because the
formation of both adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin is impaired.

Patients with cblE, cblG, and cblD variant one defects are unable to
form methylcobalamin and develop homocystinuria without methylmalonic acidemia (Fig. 105.4). The clinical manifestations are similar
in patients with these three defects. Nonspecific symptoms such as
vomiting, poor feeding, failure to thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, seizures,
and developmental delay may occur in the first few months of life.
Late-­onset forms of these disorders may present with neurocognitive
defects, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory findings
include megaloblastic anemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, homocystinuria, and hypomethioninemia. The absence of hypermethioninemia
differentiates these conditions from cystathionine β-­synthase deficiency. Renal artery thrombosis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and optic nerve atrophy have been reported in
some patients with these defects.
Diagnosis is established by DNA testing or using complementation studies performed in cultured fibroblasts. Prenatal diagnosis can
be accomplished by studies in amniotic cell cultures. cblE, cblG, and
cblD variant one deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.
The gene for cblE is MTRR, encoding methionine synthase reductase.

The gene for cblG is MTR, encoding methionine synthase. The cblD

Treatment with vitamin B12 in the form of high-­dose parenteral
hydroxycobalamin (0.3 mg/kg/day) helps improve the clinical and biochemical findings. Results vary among both diseases and sibships.

Homocystinuria Caused by Deficiency of Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR Deficiency)

This enzyme reduces 5,10-­
methylenetetrahydrofolate to form
5-­methyltetrahydrofolate, which provides the methyl group needed for
remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (see Fig. 105.3). The severity of the enzyme defect and the clinical manifestations vary considerably

in different families. Clinical findings vary from apnea, seizure, microcephaly, coma, and death to developmental delay, ataxia, motor abnormalities, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric manifestations.
Thromboembolism has also been observed. Exposure to the anesthetic
nitrous oxide (which inhibits methionine synthase) in patients with
MTHFR deficiency may result in neurologic deterioration and death.
Laboratory findings include moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and
homocystinuria. The methionine concentration is low or low-­normal.
This finding helps differentiate MTHFR deficiency from classic homocystinuria caused by cystathionine β-­synthase deficiency. The diagnosis
can be confirmed by molecular analysis of MTHFR or by the enzyme
assay in cultured fibroblasts or leukocytes.
MTHFR deficiency should be differentiated from mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to two common variants in the MTHFR gene.
Two “thermolabile” polymorphisms have been extensively studied:
c.665C>T (p.Ala222Val, previously referred to as c.677C>T) and
c.1286A>C (p.Glu429Ala, formerly referred to as c.1298A>C). These
variants may minimally affect levels of plasma total homocysteine in
some patients and are often confounded by dietary folate deficiency.
Population-­based studies revealed a surprisingly high prevalence of
homozygosity for these polymorphisms in the general population: up
to 10–15% of North American Whites and >25% in some Hispanics.
The best data support a role for the c.665C>T polymorphic variant
(formerly c. 677C>T) as a risk factor for neural tube defects. Although
clinical tests for this polymorphic variant are widely available, meta-­
analyses have not supported the association between the MTHFR polymorphic variants and risk for venous thromboembolism or between
mild hyperhomocysteinemia and an increased risk for coronary heart
disease. It is hypothesized that fortification of flour with folate may
have decreased the strength of associations observed in the past.
Homocystinuria caused by the loss of function in MTHFR (MTHFR
deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder. The diagnosis can
be confirmed by MTHFR gene analysis. Prenatal diagnosis can be
achieved by molecular analysis of MTHFR of known familial pathogenic variants or by measuring MTHFR enzyme activity in cultured
chorionic villus cells or amniocytes.
Treatment of MTHFR deficiency with a combination of folic acid,
vitamin B6, vitamin B12, methionine supplementation, and betaine has
been tried. Of these, early treatment with betaine appears to have the
most beneficial effect.

HYPERMETHIONINEMIA
Primary (Genetic) Hypermethioninemia

Elevation of plasma level of methionine occurs in several genetic conditions. These should be differentiated from acquired (nongenetic)
forms of hypermethioninemia, which can occur under various conditions of physiologic stress, especially when involving liver dysfunction.

Classic Homocystinuria
See earlier discussion.

Hepatic Methionine Adenosyltransferase (MAT I/MAT III)
Deficiency (Mudd Disease). This hepatic enzyme, which has two

isoforms, MAT I (tetrameric) and MAT III (dimeric), is encoded by
a single gene, MAT1A, and is involved in the first step of methionine
catabolism (see Fig. 105.3). Another structurally similar enzyme,
MAT II, is encoded by a different gene, MAT2A, and is expressed
predominantly in nonhepatic tissues (e.g., kidney, brain, lymphocytes). Deficiency of MAT I/MAT III causes hypermethioninemia. In
severe deficiency, total plasma homocysteine can also be elevated. The
majority of these patients have been diagnosed in the neonatal period
through screening for classic homocystinuria. Most affected individuals have residual enzyme activity and remain asymptomatic throughout life despite persistent hypermethioninemia. Some complain of an
unusual odor to their breath, likely caused by accumulation of dimethylsulfide. A few patients with complete enzyme deficiency have had
neurologic abnormalities related to demyelination (intellectual disability, dystonia, dyspraxia).
Laboratory studies reveal markedly elevated levels of plasma methionine with a normal or low level of S-­adenosylmethionine, normal

823

concentrations of S-­adenosylhomocysteine, and normal or slightly
elevated total plasma homocysteine. These findings help differentiate
MAT I/MAT III deficiency from other causes of hypermethioninemia.
No uniformly accepted therapeutic regimen has yet emerged. Long-­
term follow-­up to monitor for neurologic and liver abnormalities should
be considered. Diets low in methionine result in lowering of plasma
methionine, but the advisability of such diets has been questioned
because lowering plasma methionine, an essential amino acid, causes
further lowering of S-­adenosylmethionine, thus interfering with reactions of remethylation. Supplementation with S-­adenosylmethionine
in conjunction with a low-­methionine diet seems prudent, but no large
clinical experience is yet available. Normal pregnancies producing
normal offspring have been reported in mothers with MAT I/MAT III
(MAT1A) deficiency. The condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, although the pathogenic variant p.Arg264His in MAT1A
appears to disrupt protein dimerization and may result in mild hypermethioninemia even in heterozygous patients.
Glycine N-­Methyltransferase Deficiency. Glycine N-­methyl­
transferase (GNMT) mediates catabolism of S-­adenosylmethionine
to S-­adenosylhomocysteine (see Fig. 105.3). A few patients with deficiency of this enzyme have been reported to date. Clinically, patients
were asymptomatic except for mild hepatomegaly and elevated serum
levels of aminotransferases. Other laboratory findings included hypermethioninemia and very high levels of serum S-­adenosylmethionine.
No specific treatment has yet been identified. The condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
S-­Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase (SAHH) Deficiency. SAHH
deficiency (see Fig. 105.3) has been described infrequently. Intellectual
disability, severe hypotonia, and progressive liver dysfunction were
common clinical findings. Laboratory studies included elevated levels of serum creatine kinase, hypoalbuminemia (associated with fetal
hydrops in one family), hypoprothrombinemia, and greatly elevated
levels of serum S-­adenosylhomocysteine with moderate elevations of
plasma methionine and S-­adenosylmethionine. Marked elevation in S-­
adenosylhomocysteine has been thought to cause inhibition of methyltransferases, including those involved in the synthesis of creatine (see
Fig. 105.10) and choline, resulting in their deficiencies. Brain MRIs often
reveal delayed myelination of the white matter. The diagnosis can be
achieved by AHCY gene analysis or, if needed, by biochemical assay of
red blood cells, cultured skin fibroblasts, or liver biopsy. Treatment with
a low-­methionine diet has been used, but its long-­term effectiveness has
not been established.
Tyrosinemia Type I. See Chapter 105.2.
Citrin Deficiency. See Chapter 105.12.

Acquired (Nongenetic) Hypermethioninemia

Hypermethioninemia occurs in premature and some full-­term infants
receiving high-­protein diets, in whom it may represent delayed maturation of the enzyme MAT. Adjusting protein intake under the control
of plasma methionine usually resolves the abnormality. Hypermethioninemia is also commonly found in patients with various forms of
liver disease.

PRIMARY CYSTATHIONINEMIA
(CYSTATHIONINURIA)

Cystathionase (cystathionine γ-­
lyase encoded by CTH) deficiency
results in massive cystathioninuria and mild to moderate cystathioninemia. Cystathionase deficiency of this enzyme is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 14,000 live
births. A wide variety of clinical manifestations have been reported.
Lack of a consistent clinical picture and the presence of cystathioninuria in some individuals without apparent clinical findings suggest
that cystathionase deficiency may be of no clinical significance. Many
reported cases are responsive to oral administration of large doses of
vitamin B6 (∼100 mg/day). When cystathioninuria is discovered in a
patient, vitamin B6 treatment can be tried, but its beneficial effect has
not been established.
Primary cystathioninuria needs to be differentiated from secondary
cystathioninuria, which can occur in patients with vitamin B6 and/or

105.4 Cysteine and Cystine
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Cysteine is a sulfur-­containing amino acid synthesized from methionine (see Fig. 105.3). Oxidation of cysteine forms cystine, a poorly
soluble dimer. The most common genetic disorders of cysteine and
cystine metabolism are cystinuria (see Chapter 584) and cystinosis (see
Chapter 569.3).

SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY AND MOLYBDENUM
COFACTOR DEFICIENCY

In the last step in cysteine metabolism, sulfite is oxidized to sulfate by
sulfite oxidase, and the sulfate is excreted in the urine (see Fig. 105.3).
Sulfite oxidase is encoded by SUOX and requires a molybdenum-­pterin
complex called molybdenum cofactor. This cofactor is also necessary
for the function of two other enzymes in humans: xanthine dehydrogenase (oxidizes xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid) and aldehyde
oxidase (involved in oxidizing a number of natural compounds and
drugs). Three enzymes, encoded by three different genes (MOCS1,
MOCS2, and GPHN), are involved in the synthesis of the cofactor.
Deficiency of any of the three enzymes causes cofactor deficiency with
similar phenotypes. Most patients, who were originally diagnosed as
having sulfite oxidase deficiency, have been shown to have molybdenum cofactor deficiency. Sulfite oxidase deficiency and molybdenum
cofactor deficiency are autosomal recessive disorders.
The enzyme and cofactor deficiencies present with overlapping and
often nonspecific clinical manifestations. Refusal to feed, vomiting, an
exaggerated startle reaction, severe intractable seizures (tonic, clonic,
myoclonic), cortical atrophy with subcortical multicystic lesions, and
severe developmental delay may develop within a few weeks after birth.
The biochemical diagnosis should be considered in infants presenting with neonatal seizures and neonates with symptoms reminiscent
of hypoxic-­
ischemic encephalopathy. Bilateral dislocation of ocular lenses is a common finding in patients who survive the neonatal
period. The intractable seizures seen in this condition are in part a
consequence of secondary vitamin B6 dependency. The accumulation
of sulfites in body fluids in this condition causes the inhibition of the
antiquitin enzyme, which is necessary for the conversion of α-­amino
adipic semialdehyde to α-­aminoadipic acid; the resultant accumulation
of α-­aminoadipic semialdehyde and its cyclic form, P6C, causes the
inactivation of pyridoxal-­5-­phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6),
leading to vitamin B6–dependent epilepsy (see also Chapter 105.14).
Affected children excrete large amounts of sulfite, thiosulfate, S-­
sulfocysteine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine in the urine. Serum uric
acid and urinary excretion of sulfate and uric acid are diminished.
Fresh urine should be used for screening purposes and for quantitative
measurements of sulfite, because oxidation of sulfite to sulfate at room
temperature may produce false-­negative results. Increased concentrations of α-­aminoadipic semialdehyde and P6C can be found in the CSF,
plasma, and urine.
Diagnosis is confirmed by analysis of affected genes (often using
a multigene panel). Infrequently, measurement of sulfite oxidase and
molybdenum cofactor in fibroblasts and liver biopsies is required. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by DNA studies or by performing an assay of
sulfite oxidase activity in cultured amniotic cells, in samples of chorionic villi. The prevalence of these deficiencies in the general population
is not known but likely is very low.
Patients with MOCS1-­related molybdenum cofactor deficiency may
benefit from daily intravenous cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate
(a cPMP analogue), a compound under investigation in a multicenter
clinical trial. Large doses of vitamin B6 may alleviate the frequency and

severity of seizures but do not seem to alter the devastating neurologic
outcome. A cysteine-­restricted diet under control of plasma amino
acids to avoid essential amino acid deficiencies can be attempted in
some patients, but the long-­term efficacy of this approach is unknown.

105.5 Tryptophan
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor for nicotinic
acid (niacin) and serotonin (Fig. 105.5). The genetic disorders of
metabolism of serotonin, one of the major neurotransmitters, are discussed in Chapter 105.11.

HARTNUP DISEASE

Hartnup disease is an autosomal recessive condition caused by biallelic
pathogenic variants in SLC6A19. This gene encodes a monoamino-­
monocarboxylic amino acid transporter (B0AT1), which facilitates
transport of neutral amino acids, including tryptophan, across the
intestinal mucosa and renal tubules. Patients show significant variability
in presentation, likely related to nutritional factors, environment, and
genetic heterogeneity of modifier genes (e.g., two proteins, TMEM27 and
ACE2, that interact with B0AT1). The prevalence of Hartnup disorder is
estimated to be 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 55,000 live births. Most children with
Hartnup disease remain asymptomatic. Decreased intestinal absorption of tryptophan in conjunction with its increased renal loss can lead
to reduced availability of tryptophan for niacin synthesis. Tryptophan
deficiency can be accentuated by malabsorption such as celiac disease.
One of the more noticeable clinical manifestations in the rare symptomatic patient is cutaneous photosensitivity. The skin becomes rough and
red after moderate exposure to the sun, and with greater exposure, a
pellagra-­like rash may develop. The rash may be pruritic, and a chronic
eczema may develop. The skin changes have been reported in affected
infants as young as 10 days of age. Some patients may have intermittent
ataxia manifested as an unsteady, wide-­based gait. The ataxia may last a
few days and can respond to niacin supplementation. Cognitive development is usually normal. Episodic psychiatric manifestations such as
irritability, emotional instability, depression, and suicidal tendencies,
have been observed; these changes are usually associated with bouts of
ataxia. Short stature and atrophic glossitis are seen in some patients.
Most children diagnosed with Hartnup disorder by neonatal screening have remained asymptomatic. This indicates that other factors are
also involved in the pathogenesis of the clinical condition.
The main laboratory finding is aminoaciduria, which is restricted to
neutral amino acids (alanine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine). Urinary excretion of
proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine remains normal. This finding helps
differentiate Hartnup disorder from other causes of generalized aminoaciduria, such as renal Fanconi syndrome. Plasma concentrations of neutral
amino acids are normal or mildly decreased. This seemingly unexpected
finding reflects compensatory mechanisms that maintain normal transport and utilization of amino acids. The indole derivatives (especially
indican) may be found in large amounts in some patients, resulting from
bacterial breakdown of unabsorbed tryptophan in the intestines.
Diagnosis of Hartnup disorder is established by the intermittent
nature of symptoms and characteristic findings on the urine amino
acid analysis. When necessary, the diagnosis can be confirmed molecularly by SLC6A19 gene analysis.
Treatment with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide (50-­300 mg/day)
and a high-­protein diet results in a favorable response in symptomatic
patients with Hartnup disorder. Because of the intermittent nature of
the clinical manifestations, the efficacy of these treatments is difficult
to establish. Normal outcome for both the mother and fetus has been
reported in several affected women.

105.6 Isoleucine, Leucine, Valine, and
Related Organic Acidemias
Oleg A. Shchelochkov, Irini Manoli, and
Charles P. Venditti
The early steps in the degradation of the branched-­chain amino acids
(BCAAs)—isoleucine, leucine, and valine—are similar (see Fig. 105.4).
Under catabolic conditions, BCAAs in the muscle tissue undergo a
reversible reaction of transamination catalyzed by BCAA transaminase. α-­Ketoacids formed by this reaction then undergo an oxidative
decarboxylation step mediated by a branched-­chain α-­ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. The deficiency of BCKDH results in
maple syrup urine disease, whereas the deficiency of enzymes mediating more distal reactions results in accumulation of enzyme-­specific
levels of organic acids excreted in the urine, thus giving those inborn
errors of metabolism the eponyms organic acidemias and organic
acidurias. These disorders typically cause metabolic acidosis, which
usually occurs in the first few days of life. Although most of the clinical findings are nonspecific, some manifestations may provide important clues to the nature of the enzyme deficiency. Figure 105.6 presents
an approach to infants suspected of having an organic acidemia. The
diagnosis is usually established by identifying and measuring specific
organic acids in body fluids (blood, urine), amino acid analysis (blood),
and identifying pathogenic variants in the respective gene.
Organic acidemias are not limited to defects in the catabolic pathways of BCAAs. Disorders causing accumulation of other organic acids
include those derived from lysine (see Chapter 105.14), disorders of the
γ-­glutamyl cycle (see Chapter 105.11), those associated with lactic acid
(see Chapter 107), and dicarboxylic acidemias associated with defective fatty acid degradation (see Chapter 106).

MAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE

Decarboxylation of leucine, isoleucine, and valine is accomplished
by a complex enzyme system (BCKDH) using thiamine (vitamin B1)
pyrophosphate as a coenzyme. This mitochondrial enzyme consists of
four subunits: E1α, E1β, E2, and E3. The E3 subunit is shared with two
other dehydrogenases: pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-­ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase. Deficiency of any of these subunits causes maple syrup
urine disease (MSUD) (see Fig. 105.4), a disorder named after the
sweet odor of maple syrup discerned from body fluids, especially cerumen, sweat, and urine. Clinical conditions caused by defects in E1α, E1β,
E2 and E3 are designated as MSUD type 1A, type 1B, type 2, and type
3, respectively. This classification, however, is not very helpful clinically
because the severity of clinical manifestations does not correlate with,
or correspond specifically to, any single enzyme subunit. An affected
infant with a type 1A defect can have clinical manifestations ranging

from relatively mild to very severe. A more useful classification, based
on clinical findings and response to thiamine administration, delineates five phenotypes of MSUD.

Classic Maple Syrup Urine Disease

Classic MSUD has the most severe clinical manifestations. The
BCKDH complex activity in this group varies between 0% and 2%
of controls. Patients with uncontrolled or poorly controlled disease
develop signs of acute encephalopathy. The mechanisms underlying
this life-­threatening complication are complex, but leucine and its
derivative, α-­ketoisocaproic acid, appear to be the key factors underlying acute encephalopathy. Elevated leucine competitively inhibits the
uptake of other amino acids by the LNAA transporter. Once taken up
by the brain tissue, leucine is metabolized by BCAA aminotransferase
to α-­ketoisocaproic acid, which disrupts metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids (glutamate, γ-­aminobutyric acid [GABA], glutamine, alanine, and aspartate). α-­Ketoisocaproic acid can reversibly
inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and result in cerebral lactic acidosis.
Collectively, these processes are detrimental to the normal function of
neurons and glia, clinically manifesting as encephalopathy and brain
edema, referred to as leucinosis. Affected infants who appear healthy
at birth develop poor feeding and vomiting in the first days of life.
Lethargy and coma may ensue within a few days. Physical examination
reveals hypertonicity and muscular rigidity with severe opisthotonos.
Periods of hypertonicity may alternate with bouts of flaccidity manifested as repetitive movements of the extremities (“boxing” and “bicycling”). Neurologic findings are often mistakenly thought to be caused
by generalized sepsis and meningitis. Cerebral edema may be present; seizures occur in most infants, and hypoglycemia is common. In
contrast to most hypoglycemic states, correction of the blood glucose
concentration does not improve the clinical condition. Aside from the
blood glucose and varying degrees of ketoacidosis, routine laboratory
findings are usually unremarkable. If left untreated, death can occur in
the first few weeks or months of life.
Diagnosis was classically suspected because of the peculiar odor of
maple syrup in urine, sweat, and cerumen. It is usually confirmed by
amino acid analysis showing marked elevations in plasma levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alloisoleucine and a depressed level of alanine. Alloisoleucine is a stereoisomer of isoleucine not normally found
in blood and is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for all
forms of MSUD. Leucine levels are usually higher than those of isoleucine and valine. Urine contains high levels of leucine, isoleucine, and
valine and their respective ketoacids. These ketoacids may be detected
qualitatively by adding a few drops of 2,4-­dinitrophenylhydrazine
reagent (0.1% in 0.1N HCl) to the urine; a yellow precipitate of
2,4-­dinitrophenylhydrazone is formed in a positive test. Neuroimaging during the acute state may show cerebral edema, which is most

prominent in the cerebellum, dorsal brainstem, cerebral peduncle, and
internal capsule. After recovery from the acute state and with advancing age, hypomyelination and cerebral atrophy may be seen in neuroimaging of the brain.
Treatment of the acute state is aimed at hydration and rapid removal
of the BCAAs and their metabolites from the tissues and body fluids.
Uptake of leucine by the brain and accumulation of the downstream
metabolite, α-­ketoisocaproic acid, appear to be the key metabolic
events underlying the MSUD encephalopathy. Therefore MSUD management strategies focus on decreasing plasma leucine to control acute
and chronic manifestations of the disease.
Because renal clearance of leucine is low, hydration alone may not
produce a rapid improvement. Hemodialysis is the most effective mode
of therapy in critically ill infants and should be instituted promptly; significant decreases in plasma levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine are
usually seen within 24 hours. Sufficient calories and nutrients should
be provided intravenously or orally as soon as possible to reverse the
patient’s catabolic state. Cerebral edema, if present, may require treatment with mannitol, diuretics (e.g., furosemide), or hypertonic saline.
Counterintuitively, supplementation with isoleucine and valine is
also needed to achieve adequate control of the plasma leucine level in
MSUD patients and to sustain the net protein synthesis in tissues. Judiciously administered isoleucine and valine will compete with leucine
for the LNAA transporter at the BBB, decrease leucine entry into the
CNS, and help in the prevention and treatment of leucine encephalopathy. Phenylbutyrate, a nitrogen scavenger used to treat hyperammonemia in urea cycle disorders, has been shown to activate the BCKDH
complex and lower BCAA levels, with promising results in a subset of
MSUD patients.
Treatment after recovery from the acute state requires a diet low in
BCAAs. Synthetic formulas devoid of leucine, isoleucine, and valine
are available commercially. Because these amino acids cannot be synthesized endogenously, age-­appropriate amounts of BCAAs should be
provided in the diet in the form of complete protein. To avoid essential
amino acid deficiencies, the amount should be titrated carefully by performing frequent analyses of plasma amino acids, with close attention
to plasma isoleucine, leucine, and valine levels. A clinical condition
resembling acrodermatitis enteropathica (see Chapter 691) occurs
in affected infants whose plasma isoleucine or valine had been over-­
restricted; the addition of isoleucine or valine, respectively, to the diet
will hasten the recovery of the skin rash. Patients with MSUD need to
remain on the diet for life. Liver transplantation is offered to patients

with classic MSUD, allowing some patients to lift protein restrictions
and improve metabolic control during intercurrent illnesses.
The long-­
term prognosis of affected children remains guarded.
Severe ketoacidosis, cerebral edema, and death may occur during any stressful situation such as infection or surgery, especially in
mid-­childhood. Cognitive and other neurologic deficits are common
sequelae.

Intermediate (Mild) Maple Syrup Urine Disease

Children with intermediate MSUD develop milder disease after the
neonatal period. Clinical manifestations are insidious and limited to
the CNS. Patients have mild to moderate intellectual disability with
or without seizures. They have the odor of maple syrup and excrete
moderate amounts of the BCAAs and their ketoacid derivatives in
the urine. Plasma concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine are
moderately increased, whereas those of lactate and pyruvate tend to be
normal. These children are commonly diagnosed during an intercurrent illness, when signs and symptoms of classic MSUD may occur. The
dehydrogenase activity is 3–40% of the reference population. Because
patients with thiamine-­responsive MSUD usually have manifestations
similar to the mild form, a trial of thiamine therapy is recommended.
Diet therapy, similar to that of classic MSUD, is needed.

Intermittent Maple Syrup Urine Disease

In intermittent MSUD, seemingly normal children develop vomiting,
odor of maple syrup, ataxia, lethargy, and coma during any stress or
catabolic state such as infection or surgery. During these attacks, laboratory findings are indistinguishable from those of the classic form,
and death may occur. Treatment of the acute attack of intermittent
MSUD is similar to that of the classic form. After recovery, although a
normal diet can be tolerated, a low-­BCAA diet is recommended. The
BCKDH activity in patients with the intermittent form is higher than
in the classic form and may reach 40% of the control activity.

Thiamine-­Responsive Maple Syrup Urine Disease

Some children with mild or intermediate forms of MSUD who are
treated with high doses of thiamine show dramatic clinical and biochemical improvement. Although some respond to treatment with
thiamine at 10 mg/day, others may require as much as 100 mg/day for
at least 3 weeks before a favorable response is observed. These patients
also require a BCAA-­restricted diet. The enzymatic activity in these
patients can be up to 40% of the reference population.

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
Maple Syrup Urine Disease Caused by Deficiency of
E3 Subunit (MSUD Type 3)

Although sometimes referred to as “maple syrup urine disease type 3,”
this very rare disorder leads to clinical and biochemical abnormalities that
encompass a wide range of mitochondrial reactions. The E3 subunit, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, is a component of the BCKDH complex,
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and α-­ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex. Causative biallelic pathogenic variants in DLD that encode the
E3 dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase cause lactic acidosis, elevated pyruvate, and signs and symptoms similar to intermediate MSUD. Progressive neurologic impairment manifested by hypotonia and developmental
delay occurs after 2 months of age. Abnormal movements can progress to
ataxia or Leigh syndrome. Death may occur in early childhood.
Laboratory findings include persistent lactic acidosis with high levels
of plasma pyruvate and alanine. Plasma BCAA concentrations are moderately increased. Patients excrete large amounts of lactate, pyruvate,
α-­ketoglutarate, and the three branched-­chain ketoacids in their urine.
No effective treatment is available. BCAA-­restricted diets and treatment with high doses of thiamine, biotin, and lipoic acid have been
ineffective.

Genetics and the Prevalence of Maple
Syrup Urine Disease

Biallelic pathogenic variants in any of the following genes may result
in the clinical and biochemical manifestations of MSUD: BCKDHA
(encodes subunit E1α), BCKDHB (encodes subunit E1β), DBT (encodes
subunit E2), and DLD (encodes subunit E3). Genotype-­phenotype correlations are difficult to establish and are usually imprecise. The exception is thiamine-­responsive MSUD, shown to be caused by pathogenic
variants in DBT. Most patients are compound heterozygotes inheriting two different pathogenic alleles. Pathogenic variants in BCKDHA
(45%) and BCKDHB (35%) account for approximately 80% of cases.
Pathogenic variants in DBT are responsible for 20% of MSUD cases.
The prevalence is estimated at 1 in 185,000 live births. Classic MSUD
is more prevalent in the Old Order Mennonites in the United States, at
an estimated 1 in 380 live births. Affected patients in this population
are homozygous for a specific pathogenic variant (c.1312T>A) in the
BCKDHA-­encoding E1α subunit.
Early detection of MSUD is possible by universal newborn screening. In many cases, however, especially those with classic MSUD, the
infant may be very ill by the time screening results become available (see Chapter 104). Prenatal diagnosis has been accomplished by
enzyme assay of the cultured amniocytes, cultured chorionic villus tissue, or direct assay of samples of the chorionic villi and by identification of the known pathogenic variants in the affected gene.
Successful pregnancies have occurred in women with different
forms of MSUD. The teratogenic potential of leucine during pregnancy
is unknown. Tight control of isoleucine, leucine, and valine before and
during the pregnancy is important to minimize the risk of metabolic
decompensation and to optimize fetal nutrition. Mothers affected by
MSUD require close monitoring and meticulous management of nutrition, electrolytes, and fluids in the postpartum period.

BRANCHED-­CHAIN α-­KETOACID DEHYDROGENASE
KINASE DEFICIENCY

A defect in the regulation of BCKDH by BCKDH kinase (BCKDK), the
enzyme responsible for phosphorylation-­mediated inactivation of the
BCKDH complex, causes the reverse biochemical phenotype of MSUD.
Pathogenic variants in BCKDK decrease the negative regulation by the
kinase, resulting in uncontrolled degradation and depletion of isoleucine, leucine, and valine in plasma and the brain. Patients with BCKDK
deficiency present with low plasma concentrations of isoleucine, leucine,
and valine associated with autism, intellectual impairment, fine motor
coordination problems, and seizures.

BRANCHED-­CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER
DEFICIENCY

Isoleucine, leucine, and valine are transported across the BBB mainly
by the heterodimeric LNAA transporter LAT1 encoded by SLC7A5. A

827

defect in LAT1 caused by pathogenic variants in SLC7A5 results in low
brain concentrations of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. Patients with
this defect may present similarly to BCKDK-­deficient patients, with
autism, microcephaly, gross motor delays, and in some cases, seizures.

ISOVALERIC ACIDEMIA

Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an autosomal recessive condition caused
by biallelic pathogenic variants in IVD resulting in the deficient activity
of isovaleryl–coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (see Fig. 105.4). The
prevalence of IVA is estimated to range between 1 in 62,500 (in parts of
Germany) and 1 in 250,000 live births (in the United States). Decreased
or absent activity of isovaleryl-­CoA dehydrogenase results in impaired
leucine degradation. Accumulating derivatives of isovaleric acid, isovalerylcarnitine, isovalerylglycine, and 3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid can be
detected in body fluids and thus enable the biochemical diagnosis and
screening. Clinically, the course of IVA can be highly variable, ranging from essentially asymptomatic to severe. Introduction of newborn
screening and proactive management of IVA has changed the prognosis and clinical course. Older siblings of symptomatic newborn
infants have been reported with identical genotype and biochemical
abnormalities but without clinical manifestations, suggesting that presymptomatic detection of affected patients on the newborn screen can
improve clinical outcomes.
Patients with severe IVA can present with vomiting, severe acidosis,
hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and bone marrow
suppression in infancy. Lethargy, convulsions, and coma may ensue,
and death may occur if proper therapy is not initiated. Vomiting may
be severe enough to suggest pyloric stenosis. The characteristic odor
of “sweaty feet” or “rancid cheese” may be present. Infants who survive this acute episode are at risk of developing episodes of metabolic
decompensation later in life. In the mild form without treatment, typical clinical manifestations of severe IVA (vomiting, lethargy, acidosis,
or coma) may not appear until the child is a few months or years old.
Acute episodes of metabolic decompensation may occur during a catabolic state, such as infection, dehydration, surgery, or high-­protein
intake. Acute episodes may be mistaken for diabetic ketoacidosis. Some
patients may experience acute and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis.
Laboratory findings during the acute attacks include ketoacidosis,
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and occasionally pancytopenia. Hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, and moderate to severe hyperammonemia may
be present in some patients. Increases in plasma ammonia may suggest
a defect in the urea cycle (see Chapter 105.12). In urea cycle defects, the
infant usually shows no significant ketoacidosis (see Fig. 105.6).
Diagnosis is established by demonstrating marked elevations of isovaleric acid metabolites (isovalerylglycine, 3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid) in
body fluids, especially urine. The main compound in plasma is isovalerylcarnitine (C5-­carnitine). C5-­carnitine can be measured in dried
blood spots, enabling universal newborn screening using tandem mass
spectrometry. The diagnosis can be confirmed by molecular analysis of
the IVD gene. In some patients with equivocal results, measurement of
the enzyme activity in cultured skin fibroblasts may be necessary.
Treatment of the acute attack is aimed at rehydration, reversal of the
catabolic state (by providing adequate calories orally or intravenously),
correction of metabolic acidosis, and facilitation of the isovaleric acid
excretion. l-­Carnitine (100 mg/kg/day orally) also increases removal
of isovaleric acid by forming isovalerylcarnitine, which is excreted
in the urine. Because isovalerylglycine has a high urinary clearance,
some centers recommend glycine supplementation (250 mg/kg/day) to
enhance the formation of isovalerylglycine. Temporary restriction of
protein intake (<24 hours) may be beneficial in some cases. In patients
with significant hyperammonemia (blood ammonia >200 μmol/L),
measures that reduce blood ammonia should be employed (see Chapter 105.12). Renal replacement therapy may be needed if the previously
described measures fail to produce significant clinical and biochemical improvement. Long-­term management of IVA patients requires
restriction of protein according to age-­appropriate intake (recommended dietary allowance of protein). Patients benefit from carnitine
supplementation with or without glycine. Normal development can be
achieved with early and proper treatment.

828 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Prenatal diagnosis can be accomplished using IVD gene analysis if causative pathogenic variants are known or, less frequently, by
using an enzyme assay of cultured amniocytes. Successful pregnancies with favorable outcomes have been reported. Universal newborn
screening of IVA is used in the United States and other countries (see
Chapter 104).

MULTIPLE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCIES (DEFECTS
OF THE BIOTIN CYCLE)

Biotin is a water-­soluble vitamin that serves as a cofactor for four
carboxylase enzymes in humans: pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-­CoA
carboxylase, propionyl-­CoA carboxylase, and 3-­methylcrotonyl-­CoA
carboxylase. The latter two are involved in the catabolic pathways of
leucine, isoleucine, and valine (see Fig. 105.4).
Most dietary biotin is bound to proteins. Free biotin is generated in
the intestine by the action of digestive enzymes, by intestinal bacteria,
and perhaps by biotinidase. Biotinidase, found in serum and most tissues, is also essential for the recycling of biotin in the body by releasing
it from the apoenzymes (carboxylases; see Fig. 105.4). Free biotin must
form a covalent bond with the apocarboxylases to produce the activated enzyme (holocarboxylase). This binding is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase. Deficiencies either in holocarboxylase synthetase
or in biotinidase result in the impaired catalytic activity of carboxylases
and organic acidemias.

Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency

Infants with this rare autosomal recessive disorder become symptomatic in the first few weeks of life. Symptoms may appear as early as a
few hours after birth to as late as 8 years of age. Clinically, shortly after
birth, affected infants develop breathing difficulties (tachypnea and
apnea). Feeding problems, vomiting, and hypotonia are also usually
present. If the condition remains untreated, generalized erythematous
rash with exfoliation and alopecia, failure to thrive, irritability, seizures,
lethargy, and even coma may occur. Developmental delay is common.
Immune deficiency manifests with susceptibility to infection. Urine
may have a peculiar odor, which has been described “tomcat urine.”
The rash, when present, helps to differentiate this condition from other
organic acidemias (see Fig. 105.6).
Laboratory findings include metabolic acidosis, ketosis, hyperammonemia, and the presence of a variety of organic acids and their conjugates (lactic acid, 3-­methylcrotonic acid, 3-­methylcrotonylglycine,
tiglylglycine, 3-­
OH-­
propionic acid, methylcitric acid, and
3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid) in body fluids. Diagnosis is confirmed by
identification of pathogenic variants in HLCS or by the enzyme assay
in lymphocytes or cultured fibroblasts. Most pathogenic variants
cause the enzyme to have an increased Km (Michaelis-­Menten dissociation constant) for biotin; the enzyme activity in such patients can
be restored by the administration of large doses of biotin. Newborn
screening can identify holocarboxylase synthetase–deficient infants by
detecting elevated C5-­OH-­carnitine on tandem mass spectrometry. In
these infants, biotinidase enzymatic assay would be normal.
Treatment with biotin (10-­20 mg/day orally) usually results in an
improvement in clinical manifestations and biochemical abnormalities. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent irreversible
neurologic damage. In some patients, complete resolution may not be
achieved even with large doses (up to 60 mg/day) of biotin.
Prenatal diagnosis can be accomplished by prenatal molecular
analysis of known pathogenic variants in HLCS or by assaying enzyme
activity in cultured amniotic cells. Pregnant mothers who had previous
offspring with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency have been treated
with biotin late in pregnancy. Affected infants were normal at birth, but
the efficacy of prenatal treatment remains unclear.

Biotinidase Deficiency

Impaired biotinidase activity results in biotin deficiency. Affected
infants may develop clinical manifestations similar to those seen in
infants with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. Unlike the latter, however, symptoms tend to appear later, when the child is several months or years old. The delay in onset of symptoms presumably

results from the availability of free biotin derived from the mother or
the diet. Clinical manifestations are mostly confined to the skin and
the nervous system. Without treatment, atopic or seborrheic dermatitis, candidiasis, alopecia, ataxia, seizures (usually myoclonic), hypotonia, developmental delay, optic nerve atrophy, sensorineural hearing
loss, and immunodeficiency resulting from impaired T-­cell function
may occur. A small number of children with intractable seborrheic dermatitis and partial (15–30% activity) biotinidase deficiency, in whom
the dermatitis resolved with biotin therapy, have been reported; these
children were otherwise asymptomatic. Asymptomatic children and
adults with this enzyme deficiency have been identified in screening
programs. Most of these individuals have been shown to have partial
biotinidase deficiency. With universal newborn screening leading to
early identification and treatment of the affected patients, the clinical
disease should become extinct.
Laboratory findings and the pattern of organic acids in body fluids
resemble those associated with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency.
Diagnosis can be established by measurement of the enzyme activity
in the serum and confirmed by identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in BTD. Treatment with free biotin (5-­20 mg/day) results in a dramatic clinical and biochemical improvement. Treatment with biotin is
also suggested for individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency. The
prevalence of this autosomal recessive disorder is estimated to be 1 in
60,000 live births. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by identification of
known pathogenic variants in BTD or, less frequently, by the measurement of the enzyme activity in the amniotic cells, although in practice,
a prenatal approach is rarely used.

Multiple Carboxylase Deficiency Caused by Acquired
Biotin Deficiency

Acquired deficiency of biotin may occur in infants receiving total parenteral nutrition without added biotin, in patients with prolonged use
of antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine), and in children with short bowel syndrome or chronic diarrhea who are receiving formulas low in biotin. Excessive ingestion of
raw eggs may also cause biotin deficiency because the protein avidin in
egg white binds biotin, decreasing its absorption. Infants with acquired
biotin deficiency may develop dermatitis, alopecia, and candidal skin
infections. This condition readily responds to treatment with oral
biotin.

3-­METHYLCROTONYL-­COA CARBOXYLASE
DEFICIENCY

This enzyme is one of the four carboxylases requiring biotin as a cofactor (see Fig. 105.4). An isolated deficiency of this enzyme must be differentiated from disorders of biotin metabolism (multiple carboxylase
deficiency), which causes diminished activity of all four carboxylases
(see earlier). 3-­Methylcrotonyl-­CoA carboxylase (3-­MCC) is a heteromeric enzyme consisting of α (biotin containing) and β subunits,
encoded by the genes MCCC1 and MCCC2, respectively. 3-­MCC deficiency can be detected in the newborn period by identifying elevated
3-­hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5-­OH) in dried blood spots. Universal
newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry has identified an
unexpectedly high number of infants with 3-­MCC deficiency, with its
prevalence ranging between 1 in 2,400 and 1 in 68,000.
Clinical manifestations are highly variable, ranging from completely asymptomatic adults (including mothers of affected newborn
infants), to children presenting with developmental delay without episodes of metabolic decompensation, to patients with seizures, hyperammonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Rarely, infants who are affected by
severe 3-­MCC deficiency may appear healthy at birth but later develop
acute episodes of vomiting, hypotonia, lethargy, and convulsions after
a minor infection, in some cases progressing to life-­threatening complications (e.g., Reye syndrome, coma). In patients prone to developing
these symptoms, the onset is usually between 3 weeks and 3 years of
age. Among infants identified through newborn screening, 85–90% of
children remain apparently asymptomatic. The reason for differences
in outcomes is unknown. None of the symptoms reported so far could
be clearly attributed to the degree of enzyme deficiency.

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
Laboratory findings during acute episodes include mild to moderate metabolic acidosis, ketosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and elevated serum transaminase levels. Large amounts of
3-­hydroxyisovalerate and 3-­methylcrotonylglycine are found in the
urine. Urinary excretion of 3-­methylcrotonate is usually not detected
in this condition because the accumulated 3-­methylcrotonyl-­CoA is
converted to 3-­hydroxyisovalerate. The plasma acylcarnitine profile
shows elevated 3-­
hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5-­
OH). Severe secondary carnitine deficiency is common. 3-­MCC deficiency should
be differentiated biochemically from multiple carboxylase deficiency
(see earlier), in which, in addition to 3-­hydroxyisovalerate, lactate and
metabolites of propionic acid are also present. Diagnosis may be confirmed by molecular analysis of MCCC1 and MCCC2 or by measurement of the enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts. Documentation of
normal activities of other carboxylases is necessary to rule out multiple
carboxylase deficiency.
Treatment of acute episodes is similar to that of isovaleric acidemia
(see earlier). Hydration and measures to correct both hypoglycemia
and severe metabolic acidosis by infusing glucose and sodium bicarbonate should be instituted promptly. Secondary carnitine deficiency,
seen in up to 50% of patients, can be corrected with l-­carnitine supplementation. For symptomatic patients, some centers recommend
keeping protein intake at the recommended dietary allowance in conjunction with the oral administration of l-­carnitine and the proactive
management of catabolic states. Normal physiologic growth and development are expected in most patients.
3-­MCC deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition. Biallelic
pathogenic variants in either MCCC1 or MCCC2 result in the enzyme
deficiency with overlapping clinical features.

3-­METHYLGLUTACONIC ACIDURIAS

The 3-­methylglutaconic acidurias comprise a heterogeneous group
of metabolic disorders characterized by excessive excretion of
3-­methylglutaconic acid in the urine (Table 105.2). Other metabolites found in 3-­
methylglutaconic aciduria patients may include
3-­methylglutaric acid and 3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid. The current classification distinguishes between primary and secondary forms. Primary
3-­methylglutaconic aciduria is caused by the deficiency of mitochondrial 3-­
methylglutaconyl-­
CoA hydratase (see Fig. 105.4), formerly
3-­
methylglutaconic aciduria type I. Secondary 3-­methylglutaconic
aciduria can be further classified based on the underlying mechanism (e.g., defective phospholipid remodeling versus dysfunction of
mitochondrial membrane) or now the more preferred classification
based on the underlying molecular cause. Known causes of secondary 3-­
methylglutaconic aciduria include the X-­
linked TAZ-­related
syndrome (Barth syndrome), OPA3-­related 3-­methylglutaconic aciduria (Costeff syndrome), SERAC1-­related syndrome (MEGDEL syndrome), TMEM70-­related syndrome, and DNAJC19-­related syndrome
(DCMA syndrome).
Significant and persistent 3-­methylglutaconic aciduria with negative molecular evaluation for known genetic causes represents a heterogeneous group called 3-­methylglutaconic aciduria not otherwise
specified awaiting further molecular characterization. Primary and
secondary 3-­methylglutaconic aciduria should be distinguished from
mild and transient urinary elevations of 3-­methylglutaconic acid seen
in patients affected by other metabolic disorders or liver dysfunction,
such as mitochondrial disorders of diverse etiology.

3-­Methylglutaconyl-­CoA Hydratase Deficiency

Two main clinical presentations have been described for
3-­methylglutaconyl-­CoA hydratase deficiency, an autosomal recessive
disorder (see Fig. 105.4). In the childhood form, nonspecific neurodevelopmental findings such as speech delay or regression, choreoathetoid movements, optic nerve atrophy, and mild psychomotor delay
may be present. Metabolic acidosis may occur during a catabolic state.
In the adulthood form, affected individuals may remain asymptomatic until the second or third decade of life, when a clinical picture of
slowly progressing leukoencephalopathy with optic nerve atrophy, dysarthria, ataxia, spasticity, and dementia occurs. Brain MRI typically

829

shows white matter abnormalities, which may precede the appearance of clinical symptoms by years. Asymptomatic pediatric and adult
patients have also been reported. Patients excrete large amounts of
3-­methylglutaconic acid and moderate amounts of 3-­hydroxyisovaleric
and 3-­methylglutaric acids in urine. Treatment with l-­carnitine may
help some patients. The effectiveness of a low-­leucine diet has not been
established. The condition is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in
AUH and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Barth Syndrome (Tafazzin-­Related Disorder)

This X-­linked condition is caused by a deficiency of tafazzin, a mitochondrial protein, encoded by the TAFAZZIN gene. This enzyme is
necessary for remodeling of immature cardiolipin into its mature form.
Cardiolipin, a mitochondrial phospholipid, is critical for the integrity
of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Clinical manifestations of
Barth syndrome usually begin in the first year of life in a male infant
and include cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, growth restriction, hypoglycemia, and mild to severe neutropenia. The onset of clinical manifestations may be as late as adulthood, but most affected individuals
become symptomatic by adolescence. If patients survive infancy, relative improvement may occur with advancing age. Cognitive development is usually normal, although delayed motor function and learning
disabilities occur.
Laboratory findings include mild to moderate increases in
urinary excretion of 3-­
methylglutaconic, 3-­
methylglutaric, and
2-­ethylhydracrylic acids. Unlike primary 3-­methylglutaconic aciduria
(type I), urinary excretion of 3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid is not elevated.
The activity of the enzyme 3-­methylglutaconyl-­CoA hydratase is normal. Neutropenia is a common finding. Lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia,
low serum cholesterol, low prealbumin, and abnormal mitochondrial
ultrastructure are also common. Total cardiolipin and subclasses of
cardiolipin are very low in skin fibroblast cultures from these patients.
The monolysocardiolipin/cardiolipin ratio in cultured fibroblast is useful for establishing the diagnosis in patients with negative or equivocal
molecular results. Because of its nonspecific presentation, the condition is likely underdiagnosed and underreported.
The condition is inherited in an X-­linked recessive manner. The
gene (TAFAZZIN) has been mapped to chromosome Xq28. The modest 3-­methylglutaconic aciduria seen in Barth syndrome is thought to
be related to the defect in the mitochondrial membrane, causing the
leakage of this organic acid. Gene-­specific treatment is not available.
Patients with an unsatisfactory response to medical management of
cardiomyopathy may benefit from cardiac transplantation. Daily aspirin to reduce the risk of strokes has been described. Regular use of
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-­CSF) can help limit recurrent
infections in patients with neutropenia.

OPA3-­Related 3-­Methylglutaconic Aciduria
(Costeff Syndrome)

Clinical manifestations in patients with Costeff syndrome include
early-­onset optic nerve atrophy and later development of choreoathetoid movements, spasticity, ataxia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment. Patients excrete moderate amounts of 3-­methylglutaconic and
3-­methylglutaric acids. Activity of the enzyme 3-­methylglutaconyl-­CoA
hydratase is normal. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Pathogenic variants in OPA3 are thought to cause electron
transport chain dysfunction. Treatment is supportive.

Disorders Formerly Described as 3-­Methylglutaconic
Aciduria Type IV

3-­Methylglutaconic aciduria type IV represents a group of disorders
with a diverse genetic etiology. Two disorders in this group have been
linked to specific molecular etiology, whereas other conditions are still
awaiting the discovery of underlying molecular defects.
MEGDEL syndrome (3-­methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness,
encephalopathy, and Leigh-­like) is an autosomal recessive disorder
caused by pathogenic variants in SERAC1. Affected patients experience
optic nerve atrophy, progressive deafness, dystonia, feeding difficulty
with dysphagia, spasticity, and basal ganglia injury similar to patients

with Leigh syndrome. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated urinary
3-­methylglutaconic, high plasma lactate and alanine. Treatment is
symptomatic.
TMEM70-­related disorder is also inherited in an autosomal recessive
manner. Biallelic pathogenic variants in TMEM70 result in a mitochondrial complex V deficiency, although the exact molecular mechanism of
disease is unknown. Clinical manifestations include developmental delay,
developmental regression, Reye syndrome–like episodes, intellectual disability, failure to thrive, microcephaly, cardiomyopathy, and dysmorphic
findings. Patients are prone to metabolic decompensation, characterized
by hyperammonemia (up to 900 μmol/L) and lactic acidosis, which are
more common in the first year of life. Acute hyperammonemic episodes
are treated with intravenous glucose, lipid emulsion, ammonia-­scavenging
drugs, and occasionally hemodialysis. Long-­term therapy that has been
described includes l-­carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and bicarbonate substitution (e.g., citric acid/sodium citrate). Patients require interval echocardiographic and electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring to enable early
diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathy.

DCMA Syndrome (DNAJC19-­Related Syndrome,
3-­Methylglutaconic Aciduria Type V)

DCMA syndrome (dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia) is an autosomal
recessive disorder identified in patients of Canadian Dariusleut Hutterite
ancestry in the Great Plains of North America. As the disorder’s abbreviated name suggests, affected individuals present with dilated cardiomyopathy, long QTc interval, and CNS involvement. Neurologic symptoms
include intellectual disability, cerebellar involvement, and optic atrophy.
Growth is affected in all patients. Intrauterine growth restriction is seen
in up to 50% of patients. Cryptorchidism and hypospadias are frequent

findings in affected boys. Urine organic acid assay reveals increased
3-­methylglutaconic acid and 3-­methylglutaric acid. Biallelic pathogenic
variants in DNAJC19 are the underlying cause of DCMA syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic. Interval echocardiography and ECG can prospectively identify patients requiring treatment for cardiomyopathy and long
QTc interval.

β-­KETOTHIOLASE (3-­OXOTHIOLASE) DEFICIENCY
(MITOCHONDRIAL ACETOACETYL-­COA THIOLASE
[T2] DEFICIENCY)

The bidirectional reaction catalyzed by mitochondrial β-­ketothiolase is
involved in the final steps of both isoleucine catabolism and ketolysis. In the
isoleucine catabolic pathway, the enzyme cleaves 2-­methylacetoacetyl-­CoA
into propionyl-­CoA and acetyl-­CoA (see Fig. 105.4). In the fatty acid oxidation pathway, the enzyme generates two moles of acetyl-­CoA from one
mole of acetoacetyl-­CoA (Fig. 105.7). The same enzyme can synthesize
2-­methylacetoacetate-­CoA and acetoacetyl-­CoA in the reverse direction.
The hallmark of this disorder is ketoacidosis, often triggered by infections,
prolonged fasting, and large protein load. The mechanism of ketosis in this
condition is incompletely understood, because in this enzyme deficiency
one would expect impaired ketone formation (see Fig. 105.7). It is postulated that excess acetoacetyl-­CoA produced from other sources can be used
as a substrate for 3-­hydroxy-­3-­methylglutaryl-­CoA synthesis in the liver.
Clinical manifestations are quite variable, ranging from mild cases
showing normal development to severe episodes of acidosis starting
in the first year of life causing severe cognitive impairment. Unless
identified on the newborn screening, affected children present with
intermittent episodes of unexplained ketoacidosis. These episodes
usually occur after an intercurrent infection and respond promptly to

intravenous fluids and bicarbonate therapy. Mild to moderate hyperammonemia may also be present during attacks. Both hypoglycemia
and hyperglycemia have been reported in isolated cases. The child may
be completely asymptomatic between episodes and may tolerate a normal protein diet. Cognitive development is normal in most children.
The episodes may be misdiagnosed as salicylate poisoning because of
the similarity of the clinical findings and the interference of elevated
blood levels of acetoacetate with the colorimetric assay for salicylate.
Laboratory findings during the acute attack include ketoacidosis
and hyperammonemia. Findings of ketones in the urine and hyperglycemia may be interpreted as diabetic ketoacidosis, and a high index of
suspicion is needed to suspect this metabolic disorder. Urine organic
acid assay can provide clues leading to a correct diagnosis. Urine contains large amounts of 2-­methylacetoacetate and its decarboxylated
products butanone, 2-­
methyl-­
3-­
hydroxybutyrate, and tiglylglycine.
Lower concentrations of urinary metabolites can be seen when patients
are stable. Mild hyperglycinemia may also be present. The plasma
acylcarnitine profile shows elevations of C5:1 and C5-­OH carnitines,
although these metabolites can normalize between catabolic episodes.
Absent or minimal elevations of C5:1 and C5-­OH carnitines can result
in false-­negative results on the newborn screening of affected infants
who were clinically well at the time of blood collection. The clinical
and biochemical findings should be differentiated from those seen with
propionic and methylmalonic acidemias (see later).
Treatment of acute episodes includes hydration. Recalcitrant metabolic acidosis can be severe enough to require infusion of bicarbonate. A 10% glucose solution with the appropriate electrolytes is used to
suppress protein catabolism, lipolysis, and ketogenesis. Restriction of
protein intake to age-­appropriate physiologic requirements is recommended for long-­term therapy. Oral l-­carnitine (50-­100 mg/kg/day) is
also recommended to prevent possible secondary carnitine deficiency.
The long-­term prognosis for achieving a normal quality of life seems

very favorable. Successful pregnancy with a normal outcome has been
reported.
β-­Ketothiolase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive
manner and may be more prevalent than appreciated. Diagnosis may
be confirmed by molecular analysis of the ACAT1 gene or using an
enzyme assay of leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts.

CYTOSOLIC ACETOACETYL-­COA THIOLASE
DEFICIENCY

This enzyme catalyzes the cytosolic production of acetoacetyl-­CoA
from two moles of acetyl-­CoA (see Fig. 105.7). Cytosolic acetoacetyl-­
CoA is the precursor of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Cytosolic
acetoacetyl-­CoA thiolase (encoded by ACAT2) should be differentiated from the mitochondrial thiolase (see earlier and Fig. 105.4). Clinical manifestations in patients with this very rare enzyme deficiency
have been incompletely characterized. Patients may present with
severe progressive developmental delay, hypotonia, and choreoathetoid movements in the first few months of life. Laboratory findings
are nonspecific; elevated levels of lactate, pyruvate, acetoacetate, and
3-­hydroxybutyrate may be found in blood and urine. One patient had
normal levels of acetoacetate and 3-­hydroxybutyrate. Diagnosis can
be aided by demonstrating a deficiency in cytosolic thiolase activity in
liver biopsy or in cultured fibroblasts or by DNA analysis of ACAT2. No
effective treatment has been described, although a low-­fat diet helped
to diminish ketosis in one patient.

MITOCHONDRIAL 3-­HYDROXY-­
3-­METHYLGLUTARYL-­COA SYNTHASE DEFICIENCY

3-­Hydroxy-­3-­methylglutaryl (HMG)-­CoA synthase (mitochondrial
or type 2) catalyzes synthesis of 3-­HMG-­CoA from acetoacetyl-­CoA
and acetyl-­CoA in the mitochondria. This is a critical step in ketone
body synthesis in the liver (see Fig. 105.7). Only a few patients with

832 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
deficiency of this enzyme have been reported. The principal clinical
syndrome is hypoketotic hypoglycemia triggered by physiologic stress,
such as infections or fasting. Age at presentation has ranged from
infancy to 6 years. Children tend to be asymptomatic before these
episodes and with appropriate management can remain stable after
the recovery (except for mild hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration).
Future episodes can be prevented by avoiding prolonged fasting during ensuing intercurrent illnesses. Hepatomegaly is the most consistent physical finding in these patients. Laboratory findings include
hypoglycemia, acidosis with mild or no ketosis, elevated levels in liver
function tests, and massive dicarboxylic aciduria. The clinical and laboratory findings may be confused with fatty acid metabolism defects
(see Chapter 104). In contrast to the latter, in patients with HMG-­CoA
synthase deficiency, the blood concentrations of acylcarnitine conjugates are negative for acylcarnitine findings characteristic of fatty acid
oxidation disorders. Treatment of the secondary carnitine deficiency
with l-­carnitine supplementation can result in elevated plasma acetylcarnitine (C2-­carnitine), likely reflecting intracellular accumulation
of acetyl-­CoA.
Treatment consists of provision of adequate calories and avoidance
of prolonged periods of fasting. No dietary protein restriction was
needed.
The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and
is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in HMGCS2. The condition
should be considered in any child with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia and may be more common than appreciated.

3-­HYDROXY-­3-­METHYLGLUTARYL-­COA LYASE
DEFICIENCY (3-­HYDROXY-­3-­METHYLGLUTARIC
ACIDURIA)

3-­HMG-­CoA lyase (encoded by HMGCL) catalyzes the cleavage of
3-­HMG-­CoA to acetoacetate, a rate-­limiting enzyme for ketogenesis
(see Fig. 105.4 and Fig. 105.7). The deficiency of this enzyme is a rare
disorder seen with increased frequency in Saudi Arabia, the Iberian
Peninsula, and in Brazil in patients of Portuguese ancestry. Clinically,
approximately 30% develop symptoms in the first few days of life, and
>60% of patients become symptomatic between 3 and 11 months of
age. Infrequently, patients may remain asymptomatic until adolescence. With the addition of 3-­HMG-­CoA lyase deficiency to the newborn screening using C5-­OH-­carnitine, many infants are identified
presymptomatically in the newborn period. Similar to 3-­HMG-­CoA
synthase deficiency, patients affected by 3-­HMG-­CoA lyase deficiency
may present with acute hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Episodes of vomiting, severe hypoglycemia, hypotonia, acidosis with mild or no ketosis,
and dehydration may rapidly lead to lethargy, ataxia, and coma. These
episodes often occur during a catabolic state such as prolonged fasting
or an intercurrent infection. Hepatomegaly is common. These manifestations may be mistaken for Reye syndrome or fatty acid oxidation
defects such as medium-­chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
Long-­term complications can include dilated cardiomyopathy, hepatic
steatosis, and pancreatitis. Development can be normal, but intellectual
disability and seizures with abnormalities in the white matter seen on
brain MRI have been observed in patients after prolonged episodes of
hypoglycemia.
Laboratory findings include hypoglycemia, moderate to severe
hyperammonemia, and acidosis. There is mild or no ketosis (see
Fig. 105.7). Urinary excretion of 3-­
hydroxy-­
3-­
methylglutaric
acid and other proximal intermediate metabolites of leucine
catabolism (3-­
methylglutaric acid, 3-­
methylglutaconic acid, and
3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid) is markedly increased, causing the urine to
smell like “cat’s urine.” Glutaric and dicarboxylic acids may also be
increased in urine during acute attacks. Secondary carnitine deficiency
is common. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 3-­HMG-­CoA lyase is encoded by the gene HMGCL. Diagnosis
may be confirmed by molecular analysis of HMGCL or by enzyme
assay in cultured fibroblasts, leukocytes, or liver specimens. Prenatal
diagnosis is possible by molecular DNA analysis if the familial pathogenic variants are known or by enzymatic assay of the cultured amniocytes or a chorionic villi biopsy.

Treatment of acute episodes includes hydration, infusion of glucose
to control hypoglycemia, provision of adequate calories, and administration of bicarbonate to correct acidosis. Hyperammonemia should
be treated promptly (see Chapter 105.12). Dialysis may be required in
patients with severe recalcitrant hyperammonemia. Restriction of protein and fat intake can be considered for long-­term management. Oral
administration of l-­carnitine (50-­100 mg/kg/day) prevents secondary
carnitine deficiency. Prolonged fasting should be avoided.

SUCCINYL-­COA:3-­OXOACID-­COA TRANSFERASE
DEFICIENCY

Succinyl-­CoA:3-­oxoacid-­CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency and β-­
ketothiolase deficiency collectively are referred to as ketone utilization disorders. SCOT participates in the conversion of ketone bodies
(acetoacetate and 3-­hydroxybutyrate) generated in liver mitochondria
into acetoacetyl-­CoA in the nonhepatic tissues (see Fig. 105.7). A deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of ketone bodies,
ketoacidosis, increased use of glucose, and hypoglycemia. During fasting, patients tend to have a proportional elevation of plasma free fatty
acids. The condition may be more common than recognized because
many cases tend to be mild and remain undiagnosed. SCOT deficiency
can be distinguished from β-­ketothiolase deficiency by the absence of
2-­methylacetoacetate, 2-­methyl-­3-­hydroxybutyrate, and tiglylglycine,
characteristic of the latter disorder. Plasma acylcarnitine profile tends
to show no specific abnormalities.
A common clinical presentation is an acute episode of severe ketoacidosis in an infant who had been growing and developing normally.
About half the patients become symptomatic in the first weeks of life,
and practically all become symptomatic before 2 years of age. The acute
episode is often precipitated by a catabolic state triggered by an infection or prolonged fasting. Without treatment, the ketoacidotic episode
can result in death. A chronic subclinical ketosis may persist between
the attacks. Development is usually normal, although severe and
recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia can predispose
patients to neurocognitive impairment.
Laboratory findings during the acute episode are nonspecific and
include metabolic acidosis and ketonuria with high levels of acetoacetate and 3-­hydroxybutyrate in blood and urine. No other organic acids
are found in the blood or in the urine. Blood glucose levels are usually
normal, but hypoglycemia has been reported in some affected newborn
infants with severe ketoacidosis. Plasma amino acids and the plasma
acylcarnitine profile are usually normal. Severe SCOT deficiency can
be accompanied by ketosis even when patients are clinically stable. This
condition should be considered in any infant with unexplained bouts
of ketoacidosis. SCOT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder.
Diagnosis can be established by molecular analysis of OXCT1 or by
demonstrating a deficiency of enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts.
Treatment of acute episodes consists of rehydration with solutions
containing dextrose, correction of acidosis, and the provision of a diet
adequate in calories. Long-­term treatment should include a high-­
carbohydrate diet and avoidance of prolonged fasting and administration of dextrose before anticipated or during established catabolic
states.

MEVALONATE KINASE DEFICIENCY

Mevalonic acid, an intermediate metabolite of cholesterol synthesis, is
converted to 5-­phosphomevalonic acid by the action of the enzyme
mevalonate kinase (MVK) (see Fig. 105.7). MVK deficiency presents
with a range of symptoms. Mevalonic aciduria occupies the more severe
end of the spectrum, whereas hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome
represents the milder form of the underlying enzyme defect. Both disorders are accompanied by recurrent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms,
mucocutaneous manifestations, and lymphadenopathy. Patients with
mevalonic aciduria also show growth retardation and nervous system
involvement.

Mevalonic Aciduria

Clinical manifestations include failure to thrive, growth restriction,
intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, myopathy, hepatosplenomegaly,

cataracts, and facial dysmorphisms (dolichocephaly, frontal bossing,
low-­set ears, downward slanting of eyes, long eyelashes). Most patients
experience recurrent crises characterized by fever, vomiting, diarrhea,
hepatosplenomegaly, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, edema, and morbilliform rash. These episodes typically last 2-­7 days and recur up to 25
times a year. Death may occur during these crises.
Laboratory findings include marked elevation of mevalonic acid
in urine; the concentration of urinary mevalonic acid ranges between
500 and 56,000 mmol/mol of creatinine (normal: <0.3 mmol/mol of
creatinine). Plasma levels of mevalonic acid are also greatly increased
(as high as 540 μmol/L; normal: <0.04 μmol/L). Mevalonic acid levels
tend to correlate with the severity of the condition and increase during
crises. Serum cholesterol concentration is normal or mildly decreased.
Serum concentration of creatine kinase can be greatly increased.
Inflammatory markers are elevated during the crises. Brain MRI may
reveal progressive atrophy of the cerebellum.
Diagnosis may be confirmed by molecular analysis of MVK or by
assaying the MVK activity in lymphocytes or cultured fibroblasts. The
enzyme activity in this form of the condition is below the detection
level. Treatment with high doses of prednisone helps in the acute
crises, but because of side effects, it is not routinely used long term.
TNF-­α inhibitors and interleukin-­1 receptor antagonists have shown
to be effective in bringing significant clinical improvement, especially
in patients with chronic inflammation and frequent attacks. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Prenatal diagnosis
is possible by identifying known familial pathogenic variants in MVK,
by measurement of mevalonic acid in the amniotic fluid, or by assaying
the enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or chorionic villi samples.

Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome
(Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and Periodic
Fever Syndrome)

Some pathogenic variants of the MVK gene cause milder enzyme deficiency and produce the clinical picture of periodic fever with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D. These patients have periodic bouts of fever
associated with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, arthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and morbilliform rash
(even petechiae and purpura), which usually start before 1 year of age.
The attacks can be triggered by vaccination, minor trauma, or stress and
can occur every 1-­2 months, lasting 2-­7 days. Patients are free of symptoms between acute attacks. The diagnostic laboratory finding is elevation of serum immunoglobulin D (IgD). IgA is also elevated in 80%
of patients. During acute attacks, leukocytosis, increased C-­reactive
protein, and mild mevalonic aciduria may be present. High concentrations of serum IgD help differentiate this condition from familial
Mediterranean fever. See Chapter 204 for treatment recommendations.

PROPIONIC ACIDEMIA (PROPIONYL-­COA
CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY)

Propionic acid is an intermediate metabolite of isoleucine, valine, threonine, methionine, odd-­chain fatty acids, and side chains of cholesterol.
Normally, propionic acid in the form of propionyl-­CoA undergoes carboxylation to d-­methylmalonyl-­CoA, catalyzed by the mitochondrial
enzyme propionyl-­CoA carboxylase. This enzyme requires biotin as a
cofactor; thus the disorders of biotin metabolism, among other findings,
can also result in elevation of propionic acid metabolites (see Fig. 105.4).
Propionyl-­CoA carboxylase is a multimeric enzyme composed of two
nonidentical subunits, α and β, encoded by two genes, PCCA and PCCB,
respectively. Biallelic pathogenic variants in propionyl-­CoA carboxylase
result in an autosomal recessive disorder called propionic acidemia.
Clinical findings of propionic acidemia are not specific to this disorder only. In the severe form, patients develop symptoms in the first
few days of life. Poor feeding, vomiting, hypotonia, lethargy, dehydration, a sepsis-­like picture, and clinical signs of severe ketoacidosis
progress rapidly to coma and death. Seizures occur in approximately
30% of affected infants. If an infant survives the first attack, similar
episodes of metabolic decompensation may occur during an intercurrent infection, trauma, surgery, prolonged fasting, severe constipation,
or after ingestion of a high-­protein diet. Moderate to severe intellectual

833

disability and neurologic manifestations reflective of extrapyramidal
(dystonia, choreoathetosis, tremor) and pyramidal (paraplegia) dysfunction are common sequelae in survivors. Neuroimaging shows that
these abnormalities, which often occur after an episode of metabolic
decompensation, are the result of damage to the basal ganglia, especially to the globus pallidus. This phenomenon has been referred to as
metabolic stroke. This is the main cause of neurologic sequelae seen
in the surviving affected children. Additional long-­term complications
include failure to thrive, optic nerve atrophy, pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, and osteopenia.
In the milder form, episodes of metabolic decompensation are less
frequent, but these children are still at risk of developing intellectual
disability, seizures, long QTc interval, and severe cardiomyopathy. Universal newborn screening can identify propionic acidemia by detecting
elevated propionylcarnitine (C3-­carnitine) with an abnormal C3/C2
ratio in dried blood spots. However, in patients with the mild form of
propionic acidemia, propionylcarnitine may remain below the cutoff
value set by the screening laboratory, resulting in a false-­negative result.
Therefore physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this
disorder and follow up with a biochemical evaluation of infants and
children presenting with unexplained ketosis or metabolic acidosis.
Laboratory findings during the acute attack include various degrees
of metabolic acidosis, often with a large anion gap, ketosis, ketonuria,
hypoglycemia, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Moderate
to severe hyperammonemia is common; plasma ammonia concentrations usually correlate with the severity of the disease. In contrast to
other causes of hyperammonemia, plasma concentration of glutamine
tends to be within normal limits or decreased. The presence of severe
metabolic acidosis and normal to reduced plasma glutamine help differentiate propionic academia from hyperammonemia caused by urea
cycle defects. Measurement of plasma ammonia is especially helpful
in planning therapeutic strategies during episodes of exacerbation in
a patient whose diagnosis has been established. Mechanisms of hyperammonemia in propionic acidemia are not well understood but are
likely related to the perturbed biochemical and pH environment of
the mitochondrial matrix, where the proximal part of the urea cycle
resides.
Glycine concentration can be elevated in all body fluids (blood,
urine, CSF) and possibly is the result of the inhibited glycine cleavage system in the hepatic mitochondria (Fig. 105.8). Glycine elevation has also been observed in patients with methylmalonic acidemia.
These disorders were collectively referred to as ketotic hyperglycinemia in the past before the specific enzyme deficiencies were elucidated. Mild to moderate increase in blood lactate and lysine may also
be present in these patients. Concentrations of propionylcarnitine,
3-­hydroxypropionic acid, and methylcitric acid (presumably formed
through condensation of propionyl-­CoA with oxaloacetic acid) are
greatly elevated in the plasma and urine of infants with propionic acidemia. Propionylglycine and other intermediate metabolites of BCAA
catabolism, such as tiglylglycine, can also be found in urine. Moderate
elevations in blood levels of glycine and previously mentioned organic
acids can persist between the acute attacks. Brain imaging may reveal
cerebral atrophy, delayed myelination, and abnormalities in the globus
pallidus and other parts of the basal ganglia.
The diagnosis of propionic acidemia should be differentiated from
multiple carboxylase deficiencies (see earlier and Fig. 105.6). In addition to propionic acid metabolites, infants with the latter condition
excrete large amounts of lactic acid, 3-­methylcrotonylglycine, and
3-­hydroxyisovaleric acid. The presence of hyperammonemia may suggest a genetic defect in the urea cycle enzymes. Infants with defects in
the urea cycle are usually not acidotic (see Fig. 105.1) and have elevated
levels of plasma glutamine. The definitive diagnosis of propionic acidemia can be established through molecular analysis of PCCA and
PCCB or by measuring the enzyme activity in leukocytes or cultured
fibroblasts.
Treatment of acute episodes of metabolic decompensation includes
hydration with solutions containing glucose, correction of acidosis,
and amelioration of the catabolic state by provision of adequate calories
through enteral or parenteral hyperalimentation. A brief restriction of

protein intake, no more than 24 hours, is often necessary. Depending on the clinical status, gradual reintroduction of protein is recommended. If enteral feedings cannot be tolerated after 48 hours of protein
restriction, parenteral nutrition should be instituted to achieve the
age-­specific recommended protein intake. Patients unable to tolerate
the recommended dietary allowance of protein can receive specialized
medical foods free of isoleucine, valine, threonine, and methionine.
The composition and amount of protein typically vary among patients.
The metabolic diet composition can be adjusted by monitoring growth
and plasma amino acids drawn 3-­4 hours after the typical feeding.
Some patients may benefit from the suppression of propionogenic
gut microflora. This can be achieved by oral antibiotics such as oral
neomycin or metronidazole. Prolonged use of metronidazole should
be avoided because it has been associated with reversible peripheral
neuropathy and increased QTc interval. The risk of QTc prolongation
can be problematic in propionic acidemia patients, who are at risk for
cardiomyopathy and long QT interval. Baseline and interval ECGs are
recommended before and after initiation of metronidazole therapy.
Patients may benefit from management of constipation.
Patients with propionic acidemia often develop secondary carnitine
deficiency, presumably as a result of the urinary loss of propionylcarnitine. Administration of l-­carnitine (50-­
100 mg/kg/day orally or
intravenously) helps restore free carnitine in blood. In patients with
concomitant hyperammonemia, measures to reduce blood ammonia
should be employed (see Chapter 105.12). Very ill patients with severe

acidosis and hyperammonemia require hemodialysis to remove ammonia and other toxic compounds rapidly and efficiently. Carglumic acid
and nitrogen scavengers (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate,
sodium phenylbutyrate) can aid in the treatment of acute hyperammonemia. Although no infant with propionic acidemia has been found
to be responsive to biotin, this compound should be administered (10
mg/day orally) to all infants during the first attack and until the diagnosis is established and multiple carboxylase deficiency ruled out.
Long-­term treatment consists of a low-­protein diet meeting age-­
specific recommended dietary allowance and administration of l-­
carnitine (50-­100 mg/kg/day orally). Some centers manage mild cases
of propionic acidemia without medical foods, opting for only restricting the protein intake to the recommended dietary allowance. Patients
unable to tolerate the recommended dietary intake of protein may
require medical foods free of propionate precursors (isoleucine, valine,
methionine, and threonine). Excessive use of medical foods while
restricting natural-­source protein may cause a deficiency of the essential amino acids, especially isoleucine and valine, which may cause a
condition resembling acrodermatitis enteropathica (see Chapter 712).
Over-­restriction of methionine, especially in the first years of life, may
contribute to the reduced brain growth and microcephaly. To avoid
this problem, natural proteins should comprise most of the dietary
protein. Some patients may require bicarbonate substitution (e.g.,
citric acid/sodium citrate) to correct chronic acidosis. The concentration of plasma ammonia usually normalizes between attacks, although

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
some patients may experience mild chronic hyperammonemia. Acute
attacks triggered by infections, fasting, trauma, stress, constipation,
or dietary indiscretions should be treated promptly and aggressively.
Close monitoring of plasma ammonia, plasma amino acids obtained
3-­4 hours after the last typical meal (especially isoleucine, leucine,
valine, threonine, and methionine), and growth parameters is necessary to ensure the diet is appropriate. Orthotopic liver transplantation
is used in clinically unstable patients experiencing recurrent hyperammonemia, frequent metabolic decompensations, and poor growth.
Liver transplantation does not cure propionic acidemia, and lifelong
dietary management and proactive management during periods of significant metabolic stress are recommended.
The long-­term prognosis is poor. Death may occur during an acute
attack. Normal psychomotor development is possible in a mild form
identified through newborn screening. Children identified clinically
may manifest some degree of permanent neurodevelopmental deficit, such as tremor, dystonia, chorea, and spasticity despite adequate
therapy. These neurologic findings may be the sequelae of a metabolic
stroke occurring during an acute decompensation. A long QTc interval
and cardiomyopathy with potential progression to heart failure, fatal
arrhythmias, and death may develop in older affected children despite
adequate metabolic control. Acute pancreatitis is a common and severe
complication in propionic acidemia. Osteoporosis can predispose to
fractures, which can occur with minimal mechanical stress.
Prenatal diagnosis can be achieved by identification of known
familial pathogenic variants in PCCA or PCCB or by measuring the
enzyme activity in cultured amniotic cells or in samples of uncultured
chorionic villi.
Propionic acidemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It
has a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 105,000 to 1 in 250,000 live births. It
is more prevalent in Greenlandic Inuits (1 in 1,000) and in some Saudi
Arabian tribes (1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000 live births). Biallelic pathogenic variants in either gene result in similar clinical and biochemical manifestations. Although pregnancies with normal outcomes have
been reported, the perinatal period poses special risks to females with
propionic acidemia because of hyperemesis gravidarum, worsening
cardiomyopathy, changing protein requirements, and risk of metabolic
decompensation.

ISOLATED METHYLMALONIC ACIDEMIAS

Methylmalonic acidemias are a group of metabolic disorders of diverse
etiology characterized by impaired conversion of methylmalonyl-­CoA
into succinyl-­CoA. Propionyl-­CoA derived from catabolism of isoleucine, valine, threonine, methionine, side chain of cholesterol, and odd-­
chain fatty acids is catalyzed by propionyl-­CoA carboxylase to form
d-­methylmalonyl-­CoA. Methylmalonyl-­CoA epimerase then converts
d-­
methylmalonyl-­
CoA to its enantiomer l-­methylmalonyl-­CoA.
Methylmalonyl-­CoA epimerase deficiency is a rare disorder associated with persistent elevations of propionate-­related metabolites and
methylmalonic acid. It may present with metabolic acidosis, ketosis,
but patients appear more clinically stable than those with severe forms
of methylmalonic acidemia.
In the next biochemical step, l-­methylmalonyl-­CoA is converted
to succinyl-­CoA by methylmalonyl-­CoA mutase (see Fig. 105.4). The
latter enzyme requires 5-­deoxyadenosylcobalamin, a metabolite of
vitamin B12, as a coenzyme. Deficiency of either the mutase or its coenzyme results in the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and its precursors in body fluids. Two biochemical forms of methylmalonyl-­CoA
mutase deficiencies have been identified. These are designated mut0,
referring to no detectable enzyme activity, and mut−, indicating residual, although insufficient, mutase activity. Patients with methylmalonic
acidemia due to deficiency of the mutase apoenzyme (mut0) are not
responsive to hydroxocobalamin therapy.
In the remaining methylmalonic acidemia patients, the defect resides
in the formation of adenosylcobalamin from dietary vitamin B12.
The absorption of dietary vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum requires
intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric parietal cells. It
is transported in the blood by haptocorrin and transcobalamin II. The
transcobalamin II–cobalamin complex (TCII-­Cbl) is recognized by

835

a specific receptor on the cell membrane (a transcobalamin receptor
encoded by CD320) and enters the cell by endocytosis. In the lysosome,
TCII-­Cbl is hydrolyzed, and, with the participation of LMBRD1 (cblF)
and ABCD4 (cblJ), free cobalamin is released into the cytosol (see Fig.
105.4). Biallelic pathogenic variants in either LMBRD1 or ABCD4
genes result in impaired release of cobalamin from lysosomes. In the
cytoplasm, cobalamin binds to the MMACHC protein (see cblC later),
which removes a moiety attached to cobalt in the cobalamin molecule
and reduces the cobalt from oxidation state +3 (cob[III]alamin) to
+2 (cob[II]alamin). It then enters the mitochondria, where it is catalyzed by MMAB (cblB) and MMAA (cblA) to form adenosylcobalamin, a coenzyme for methylmalonyl-­CoA mutase. The other arm of
the pathway directs cytosolic cobalamin toward methionine synthase
reductase (cblE), which forms methylcobalamin, acting as a coenzyme
for methionine synthase (cblG, see Fig. 105.3). The MMADHC protein
(see cblD) appears to play a role in determining whether cobalamin
enters the mitochondria or remains in the cytoplasm.
The uptake of TCII-­Cbl by cells is impaired in individuals with
pathogenic variants affecting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320),
which is located on the cell surface. Individuals homozygous for
pathogenic variants in the CD320 gene encoding the transcobalamin
receptor may have mild elevations of methylmalonic acid in the blood
and urine. These patients can be identified by the newborn screen
based on the elevated propionylcarnitine (C3-­carnitine). In transcobalamin receptor deficiency, methylmalonic acid levels and plasma
propionylcarnitine tend to normalize in the first year of life. It is not
clear whether a long-­term clinical phenotype is associated with this
defect.
Nine different defects in the intracellular metabolism of cobalamin
have been identified. These are designated cblA through cblG, cblJ, and
cblX, where cbl stands for a defect in any step of cobalamin metabolism. The cblA, cblB, and cblD-­MMA defects cause methylmalonic
acidemia alone. In patients with cblC, cblD-­combined methylmalonic
acidemia and homocystinuria, cblF, cblJ, and cblX defects, synthesis of
both adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin is impaired, resulting
in combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria. The cblD-­
homocystinuria, cblE, and cblG defects affect only the synthesis of
methylcobalamin, resulting in homocystinuria without methylmalonic
aciduria (see Chapter 105.3).
Biochemical manifestations of patients with isolated methylmalonic
acidemia caused by mut0, mut−, cblA, cblB, and cblD-­MMA overlap.
The wide variations in the severity of the clinical course range from
very sick newborn infants to apparently asymptomatic adults. In
severe forms, lethargy, feeding problems, vomiting, a sepsis-­like picture, tachypnea (from metabolic ketoacidosis), and hypotonia may
develop in the first few days of life and may progress to hyperammonemic encephalopathy, coma, and death if left untreated. Infants who
survive the first attack may go on to develop similar acute metabolic
episodes during a catabolic state such as infection or prolonged fasting or after ingestion of a high-­protein diet. In certain situations, such
acute events can cause a sudden injury of the basal ganglia, a metabolic stroke, resulting in a debilitating movement disorder. Between
the acute attacks, the patient usually continues to exhibit hypotonia
and feeding problems with failure to thrive, while other complications
of the disease occur with age, including recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression, osteopenia, and optic nerve atrophy.
Chronic renal failure and tubulointerstitial nephritis necessitating
renal transplant have been reported in older patients. Renal complications are more severe in patients with the mut0 and severe cblB forms of
methylmalonic acidemia. In milder forms, patients may present later in
life with hypotonia, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Neurocognitive development of patients with mild methylmalonic acidemia
may remain within the normal range.
The episodic nature of the condition and its biochemical abnormalities in some patients may be confused with those of ethylene glycol
(antifreeze) ingestion. Furthermore, the peak of propionate in a blood
sample from an infant with methylmalonic acidemia has been mistaken for ethylene glycol when the sample was assayed by gas chromatography without mass spectrometry.

836 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Laboratory findings include ketosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, anemia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, and the presence of large quantities of methylmalonic acid in body fluids (see Fig. 105.6). Metabolites of propionic acid
(3-­hydroxypropionate and methylcitrate) are also found in the urine.
The plasma acylcarnitine profile reveals elevated propionylcarnitine
(C3-­carnitine) and methylmalonylcarnitine (C4DC-­carnitine). Hyperammonemia in methylmalonic acidemia may be confused with a urea
cycle disorder. However, patients with defects in urea cycle enzymes
are typically not acidotic and tend to have high plasma glutamine (see
Fig. 105.12). The reason for hyperammonemia is not well understood,
but it is likely related to the inhibition of the proximal urea cycle in the
mitochondrial matrix.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying pathogenic variants in the causal gene, by measuring propionate incorporation with
complementation analysis in cultured fibroblasts, and by measuring
the specific activity of the mutase enzyme in biopsies or cell extracts.
Treatment of acute attacks is similar to propionic acidemia. Long-­
term treatment consists of administration of a low-­protein diet limited
to the recommended dietary allowance and l-­carnitine (50-­100 mg/
kg/day orally). Patients with severe forms of methylmalonic acidemia
may require protein diet modifications similar to those prescribed for
patients with propionic acidemia. Patients with isolated methylmalonic acidemia caused by defects in the intracellular metabolism of
cobalamin (cblA, cblD-­MMA, and some patients with cblB) respond
to parenteral hydroxocobalamin. Chronic bicarbonate replacement
therapy is usually required to correct chronic acidosis. Carglumic acid
is used to improve ureagenic function by stimulating its first step catalyzed by the carbamoyl-­phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and to facilitate
ammonia detoxification during acute hyperammonemia. Ammonia
scavengers (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, sodium phenylbutyrate) should be used cautiously. Plasma ammonia tends to normalize between attacks, and chronic treatment of hyperammonemia is
rarely needed. Stressful situations that may trigger acute attacks (infection, prolonged fasting, trauma, surgeries, high-­protein meals) should
be treated promptly.
Inadequate oral intake secondary to poor appetite, protein over-­
restriction, or essential amino acid deficiencies is a common complication in the long-­term management of these patients. Consequently,
enteral feeding through gastrostomy is often recommended early in the
course of treatment. Close monitoring of blood pH, essential amino
acid levels, blood and urinary concentrations of methylmalonate, and
growth parameters is required to ensure that the nutritional prescription
meets the patient’s metabolic demands. In addition, frequent monitoring of kidney function, vision, hearing, and bone mineral density are
necessary for early recognition and management of chronic complications. Glutathione deficiency responsive to treatment with ascorbate
has been described.
Liver, kidney, and combined liver-­kidney transplantations have been
attempted in an increasing number of affected patients. Liver and liver-­
kidney transplantation can alleviate, but not eliminate, the metabolic
abnormalities. Furthermore, liver and liver-­
kidney transplants do
not provide complete protection against the occurrence of metabolic
stroke. Kidney transplantation alone can restore the renal function but
results in only minor improvement of the clinical stability of patients.
Prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms and the occurrence of complications. In general, patients with complete deficiency of
mutase apoenzyme (mut0) and severe forms of cblB deficiency have the
least favorable prognosis, and those with mut− and cblA defects have a
better outcome.
Methylmalonic acidemia can be identified on the universal newborn
screening by measuring propionylcarnitine (C3) using tandem mass
spectrometry. The prevalence of all forms of methylmalonic aciduria is
estimated at 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births. All defects causing
isolated methylmalonic acidemia are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Pathogenic variants in the genes for cblA (MMAA), cblB
(MMAB), and all forms of cblD (MMADHC) have been identified in
affected patients. The previously described cblH group is identical to
the cblD-­MMA defect.

COMBINED METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA AND
HOMOCYSTINURIA (cblC, epi-­cblC, cblD, cblF,
cblJ, AND cblX DEFECTS)

Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria caused by
cblC deficiency is the most common type of intracellular cobalamin
(vitamin B12) biosynthesis defect. Deficiency of cblC is as common
as methylmalonyl-­CoA mutase deficiency. The other disorders (cblD,
cblF, cblJ, cblX) are much rarer (see Figs. 105.3 and 105.4). Neurologic
findings are prominent in patients with cblC, epi-­cblC, cblD-­combined,
and cblX defects. Most patients with the cblC defect present in the
first month of life because of failure to thrive, lethargy, poor feeding,
developmental delay, nystagmus, and seizures. Hyperammonemia may
be seen infrequently, whereas hyperglycinemia is not present, unlike
in isolated mut-­type methylmalonic acidemia. Intrauterine growth
restriction and microcephaly suggest that cblC can manifest prenatally in some affected infants. Late-­onset patients with sudden development of dementia and myelopathy have been reported, even with
presentation in adulthood. Megaloblastic anemia is a common finding
in patients with cblC defect. Mild to moderate increases in concentrations of methylmalonic acid and significant elevations in total plasma
homocysteine are found in blood. Unlike classic homocystinuria, in
untreated cblC, patients’ plasma methionine is low to normal. Retinal
abnormalities (e.g., bull’s eye maculopathy) resulting in severe progressive vision loss are common and can be seen as early as 3 months of age,
even in prospectively identified and well-­treated patients. Thrombotic
microangiopathy can present as hemolytic uremic syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. Hydrocephalus and noncompaction cardiomyopathy have been reported as complications in
patients with cblC defect.
Similar to cblC patients, males with cblX have elevations of both total
plasma homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, but they tend to have
milder elevations of these metabolites. Unlike cblC-­deficient patients,
who tend to respond to treatment, cblX-­deficient patients experience
failure to thrive, severe developmental delay, and intractable epilepsy
despite aggressive treatment.
Clinical findings in cblF deficiency are quite variable. Patients
may present with poor feeding, growth and developmental delay, and
persistent stomatitis manifesting in the first months of life. Delay in
diagnosis and treatment can be accompanied by hyperpigmentation
of skin, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and short stature.
Vitamin B12 malabsorption and low plasma vitamin B12 has been noted
in patients with cblF defect. Clinical manifestations of cblJ defect show
significant overlap with those of the cblF deficiency. Dysmorphic features and congenital heart disease have been reported in some patients
with cblF and cblJ defects.
Experience with treatment of patients with cblC, cblD, cblF, cblJ, and
cblX defects is limited. Large doses of hydroxocobalamin (up to 0.3
mg/kg/day) in conjunction with betaine (up to 250 mg/kg/day) produce biochemical improvement with variable clinical effect. Patients
with cblF and cblJ deficiency typically show a favorable biochemical
and clinical response to smaller hydroxocobalamin doses (1 mg once
weekly to 1 mg daily parenterally). Folic or folinic acid supplementation
is recommended. Dietary methionine deficiency should be avoided.
The cblC disorder is caused by pathogenic variants in the MMACHC
gene. A frameshift variant (c.271dupA) is seen in up to 40% of MMACHC
alleles and is associated with a less favorable clinical outcome. Epi-­
cblC, with a similar phenotype, is caused by compound heterozygous
variants in MMACHC and PRDX1, a neighboring gene. Pathogenic
variants in PRDX1 cause hypermethylation and silencing of the promoter/exon 1 of MMACHC, resulting in repressed gene expression.
The cblD disorder is caused by pathogenic variants in the MMADHC
gene. Pathogenic variants resulting in cblD-­homocystinuria affect the
C-­terminal domain of the gene product; those resulting in cblD-­MMA
(e.g., causing only methylmalonic aciduria) affect the N-­terminus.
Patients with classic cblD, with both homocystinuria and methylmalonic acidemia, have pathogenic variants resulting in decreased protein expression. The cblF disorder is caused by pathogenic variants
in the LMBRD1 gene encoding a lysosomal membrane protein. The
cblJ disorder is associated with pathogenic variants in the ABCD4

localized to the lysosomal membrane. The cblX disorder is caused by
pathogenic variants in the HCFC1 gene on the X chromosome (Xq28),
which encodes a transcription factor that appears to be essential for
expression of the MMACHC gene. This is the only X-­linked disorder
in the B12 intracellular metabolism pathway. Rare defects resulting in a
phenotype overlapping with cblX deficiency have been associated with
biallelic pathogenic variants in the genes THAP11 or ZNF143.

because of the coexistence of acidosis and ketosis. The pathogenesis of
hyperglycinemia in these disorders is not understood. Inhibition of the
glycine cleavage enzyme system by the various organic acids and post-­
translational modification has been shown to occur in some of these
biochemical disorders. The term nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH)
is reserved for the clinical condition caused by the genetic deficiency of
the glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS, see Fig. 105.8). In this condition, hyperglycinemia is present without ketosis.

ISOLATED HOMOCYSTINURIA

NONKETOTIC HYPERGLYCINEMIA (GLYCINE
ENCEPHALOPATHY)

Patients with cblD variant one, cblE, and cblG deficiency present with
isolated homocystinuria without methylmalonic acidemia (see Chapter 105.3).

COMBINED MALONIC AND METHYLMALONIC
ACIDURIA (ACSF3-­RELATED DISORDER)

Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) is a
rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from pathogenic variants
in ACSF3. ACSF3 is a putative acyl-­CoA synthetase required for the
conversion of malonic and methylmalonic acids to their CoA derivatives in the mitochondrial matrix. The disorder can be suspected based
on the presence of elevated malonic and methylmalonic acids in urine
and plasma. It is distinguished from malonyl-­
CoA decarboxylase
because methylmalonic acid is about fivefold greater than malonic acid
in the urine. Plasma propionylcarnitine (C3-­carnitine) in CMAMMA
patients is normal, so universal newborn screening programs using
C3-­carnitine in blood spots to screen for methylmalonic acidemia
would not detect this condition. The clinical phenotype is incompletely
understood. Young patients identified prospectively in infancy through
urine-­based newborn screening were reported to be asymptomatic, but
the long-­term outcome in this cohort awaits further characterization.
Older patients ascertained clinically have highly variable presentations,
including metabolic crises, failure to thrive, seizures, memory problems, optic nerve or spinal cord atrophy, and progressive neurodegeneration. Treatment of CMAMMA is supportive and includes avoidance
of an excessively high-­protein diet. Vitamin B12 supplementation does
not appear to lower malonic and methylmalonic metabolites in body
fluids.

105.7 Glycine
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Glycine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized by multiple endogenous sources, including serine, choline, and threonine. Structurally,
it is the simplest amino acid. Glycine is involved in many reactions
in the body, especially in the nervous system, where it functions as a
neurotransmitter (excitatory in the cortex, inhibitory in the brainstem
and the spinal cord; see Chapter 105.11). Its main catabolic pathway
requires the glycine cleavage system, a pyridoxal phosphate–dependent,
mitochondrial enzyme complex that converts glycine to carbon dioxide and ammonia and transfers α-­carbon to tetrahydrofolate (see Fig.
105.8). The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins: P
protein (glycine decarboxylase), H protein, T protein, and L protein,
which are encoded by four different genes.

HYPOGLYCINEMIA

Defects in the biosynthetic pathway of serine (see Chapter 105.8) cause
a deficiency of glycine in addition to that of serine in body fluids, especially in the CSF. Isolated primary deficiency of glycine has not been
reported.

HYPERGLYCINEMIA

Elevated levels of glycine in body fluids occur in propionic acidemia,
methylmalonic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, and β-­ketothiolase deficiency, which are collectively referred to as ketotic hyperglycinemia

Four forms of NKH have been identified: neonatal, infantile, late onset,
and transient. NKH is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in either of three genes, GLDC (encodes P
protein), AMT (encodes T protein), and GCSH (encodes H protein).
The L-­protein gene (DLD) encodes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase,
the E3 component of α-­ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes, and is discussed in Chapter 105.6. Birth prevalence of NKH is ∼1:75,000, but a
high frequency of the disorder has been noted in Northern Finland
(1:12,000 live births), suggesting that this disorder is likely underdiagnosed in some regions of the world.
NKH should be differentiated from the GCS cofactor deficiency
caused by the deficiency of lipoate resulting from biallelic pathogenic
variants in genes involved in lipoate synthesis (LIAS, LIPT2, BOLA3,
GLRX5, IBA57, and NFU1).

Neonatal Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia

This is the most common form of NKH. Clinical manifestations become
apparent in the first few days of life (between 6 hours and 8 days after
birth). Poor feeding, failure to suck, lethargy, and profound hypotonia
may progress rapidly to a deep coma, apnea, and death. Convulsions,
especially myoclonic seizures, and hiccups are common.
Laboratory findings reveal moderate to severe hyperglycinemia (as
high as eight times the upper reference range) and hyperglycinuria. The
unequivocal elevation of glycine concentration in CSF (15-­30 times
the upper reference range) and the high ratio of glycine concentration in CSF to that in plasma (a value >0.08, reference value <0.02)
are diagnostic of NKH. Affected patients’ blood pH is usually normal.
The plasma acylcarnitine profile and urine organic acid assay reveal no
abnormalities. CSF serine levels can be low.
Approximately 30% of NKH infants die despite supportive therapy.
Those who survive develop profound intellectual disability and intractable seizure disorders (myoclonic and/or grand mal seizures). Hydrocephalus, requiring shunting, and pulmonary hypertension have been
noted in survivors. Transient hyperglycemia may prompt evaluation
for biochemical phenocopies of NKH (e.g., organic acidemias), brain
imaging studies to evaluate for intracerebral hemorrhage or hypoxic-­
ischemic injury, and ultimately may require molecular studies of AMT,
GLDC, and GCSH.

Transient Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia

Most clinical and laboratory manifestations of transient NKH are
indistinguishable from those of the neonatal form. By 2-­8 weeks of
age, however, a complete clinical recovery may occur, and the elevated glycine levels in plasma and CSF normalize after the patient
stops a glycine-­lowering medication. Some of these patients develop
normally with no neurologic sequelae, but intellectual disability has
been noted in others. The etiology of this condition is not known, but
it is thought to be a consequence of immaturity of the enzyme system;
genetic testing is normal. Transient hyperglycemia should prompt
consideration of additional biochemical studies; brain imaging; and
molecular studies to evaluate for pathogenic variants in AMT, GLDC,
and GCSH.

Infantile Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia

In infantile NKH, previously healthy-­appearing infants develop signs
and symptoms of neonatal NKH after 6 months of age. Seizures and
hypotonia are common presenting signs. Infantile NKH appears to be a
milder form of neonatal NKH; infants usually survive, and intellectual

838 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
disability is not as profound as in the neonatal form. Laboratory findings in patients with infantile NKH are identical to those seen in neonatal NKH.

Late-­Onset Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia

Clinical manifestations of this atypical form of NKH include progressive spastic diplegia, optic nerve atrophy, and choreoathetotic movements. Age of onset has been between 2 and 33 years. Symptoms of
delirium, chorea, and vertical gaze palsy may occur episodically in
some patients during an intercurrent infection. Mental development is
usually normal, but mild cognitive impairment and infrequent seizures
have been reported in some patients.
Laboratory findings in late-­onset NKH are similar but not as pronounced as in neonatal NKH.
All forms of NKH should be differentiated from ketotic hyperglycinemia, pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency, ingestion
of valproic acid, and transient glycine encephalopathy. Valproic acid
can moderately increase blood, CSF, and urinary concentrations of glycine. Repeat assays after discontinuation of the drug will help establish
the diagnosis.

Diagnosis and Treatment

A diagnosis of NKH can be suspected based on the findings of elevated
glycine in plasma or CSF and the abnormal CSF/plasma ratio of glycine. The diagnosis is confirmed using molecular analysis of the NKH-­
related genes (AMT, GLDC, and GCSH). Rarely, enzymatic assay on
liver specimens is necessary to establish the diagnosis. Enzyme activity
in the neonatal form is close to zero, whereas in the other forms, some
residual activity is present. In most patients with neonatal NKH, the
enzyme defect resides in the P protein (75%). Defects in the T protein
account for approximately 20% of cases, whereas <1% are caused by
pathogenic variants in the H protein.
Prenatal diagnosis can be accomplished by identifying known
familial pathogenic variants in the affected gene or by performing an
assay of the enzyme activity in chorionic villus biopsy specimens.
No effective treatment is currently available. Exchange transfusion,
dietary restriction of glycine, and administration of sodium benzoate
or folate have not altered the neurologic outcome in severe forms of
NKH. Patients with attenuated NKH may experience clinical improvement from enteral sodium benzoate. Drugs that counteract the effect
of glycine on neuronal cells, such as dextromethorphan and felbamate,
have shown some beneficial effects in patients with the mild forms of
the condition.

SARCOSINEMIA

Increased concentrations of sarcosine (N-­methylglycine) are observed
in both blood and urine of probands affected by sarcosine dehydrogenase complex deficiency. This autosomal recessive metabolic condition
is caused by a defect in sarcosine dehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts sarcosine to glycine (see Fig. 105.8) and is encoded by SARDH.
No consistent clinical picture has been attributed to sarcosinemia.

PRIMARY TRIMETHYLAMINURIA

Trimethylamine is normally produced by intestinal bacteria from the
breakdown of dietary choline and trimethylamine oxide by bacteria.
Egg yolk and liver are the main sources of choline, and fish is the major
source of trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine is absorbed and
oxidized in the liver by trimethylamine oxidase (a flavin-­containing
monooxygenase encoded by FMO3) to trimethylamine oxide, which
is odorless and excreted in the urine (see Fig. 105.8). Deficiency of
this enzyme results in massive excretion of trimethylamine in urine.
There is a body odor that resembles that of rotting fish, which may
have significant psychosocial ramifications. Transient symptomatic
trimethylaminuria can occur in normal individuals after ingestion of
large quantities of the previously mentioned foods.
Treatment with oral activated charcoal and short courses of oral
metronidazole, neomycin, or lactulose cause temporary reduction in
body odor. Restriction of fish, eggs, liver, and other sources of choline
(e.g., nuts, grains) in the diet significantly reduces the odor. Topical use
of acidic soaps (pH 5.5) can also help control the odor.

HYPEROXALURIA AND OXALOSIS

Normally, oxalic acid is derived mostly from oxidation of glyoxylic acid
and, to a lesser degree, from oxidation of ascorbic acid (see Fig. 105.8).
Glyoxylic acid is formed from oxidation of glycolic acid and glycine
in the peroxisomes and catabolism of hydroxyproline in the mitochondria mediated by 4-­hydroxy-­2-­oxoglutarate aldolase 1 (encoded
by HOGA1), the underlying cause of primary hyperoxaluria type 3
(Fig. 105.9). Vegetables and foods containing oxalic acid, such as spinach, rhubarb, and almond milk, are the main exogenous sources of glycolic and oxalic acids; most of glyoxylic and oxalic acids are produced
endogenously. Normally, a major portion of glyoxylate produced in
the body is shuttled to peroxisomes, where it is converted to glycine
by the action of the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate transaminase (AGT
encoded by AGXT). Deficiency of this enzyme causes primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Most of the remaining glyoxylate in the cytosol is
reduced to glycolate by the action of the enzyme glyoxylate reductase/

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
hydroxypyruvate reductase (GR/HPR encoded by GRHPR). Deficiency
of this enzyme causes primary hyperoxaluria type 2. These pathways
protect the body from excessive production of oxalic acid (see Fig.
105.8). Any glyoxylate that cannot be disposed of through these pathways is readily converted to oxalic acid by the action of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Oxalic acid cannot be further metabolized
in humans and is excreted in the urine as oxalates. Calcium oxalate
is relatively insoluble in water and precipitates in tissues (kidneys and
joints) if its concentration increases in the body.
Secondary hyperoxaluria has been observed in pyridoxine deficiency (cofactor for alanine:glyoxylate transaminase), in patients with
IBD, extensive resection of the small bowel or jejunoileal bypass (enteric
hyperoxaluria), after ingestion of ethylene glycol or high doses of vitamin C, and after administration of the anesthetic agent methoxyflurane (which can be catabolized to oxalic acid as one of its by-­products).
Acute, fatal hyperoxaluria may develop after ingestion of plants with
high oxalic acid content (e.g., sorrel) or intentional ingestion of oxalic
acid. Precipitation of calcium oxalate in tissues causes hypocalcemia,
liver necrosis, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and death. The lethal
dose of oxalic acid is estimated at 5-­30 g.
Primary hyperoxaluria is a group of disorders in which large
amounts of oxalates accumulate in the body. Three types of primary
hyperoxaluria have been identified to date. The term oxalosis refers to
deposition of calcium oxalate in parenchymal tissues.

Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1

This rare autosomal recessive condition (prevalence of 1 in 120,000 live
births in Europe) is the most common form of primary hyperoxaluria
and can be seen in in ∼1% of children diagnosed with end-­stage renal
disease. Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is caused by deficiency of the
peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate transaminase (AGXT), which
is expressed almost exclusively in the liver peroxisomes and requires
pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. In the absence of this enzyme,
glyoxylic acid cannot be converted to glycine and is transferred to the
cytosol, where it is oxidized to oxalic acid (see earlier and Fig. 105.8).
The age of presentation varies widely, from the neonatal period to
late adulthood. The majority of patients become symptomatic in late
childhood or early adolescence. In about 20% of cases, symptoms
develop before the infant’s first birthday. The initial clinical manifestations are related to renal stones and nephrocalcinosis. Renal colic
and asymptomatic hematuria lead to a gradual deterioration of renal
function, manifested by growth retardation and uremia. If the disorder
is left untreated, most patients die before 20 years of age from renal
failure. Other frequent manifestations of the disease include failure to
thrive, short stature, arterial calcifications, arrhythmia, heart failure,
hypothyroidism, and skin nodules. Acute arthritis is a rare manifestation and can be misdiagnosed as gout because uric acid is often elevated
in patients with type 1 hyperoxaluria, driven in part by the worsening
renal function. Crystalline retinopathy and optic neuropathy causing
visual loss have been reported.
A marked increase in urinary excretion of oxalate (typical excretion:
10-­50 mg/day) is the most important laboratory finding. The presence
of oxalate crystals in urinary sediment is rarely helpful for diagnosis
because such crystals can also be seen in otherwise healthy individuals. Urinary excretion of glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid is increased in
most, but not all, patients. Diagnosis can be confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in the AGXT gene or by performing
an enzymatic assay in liver specimens.
The diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 can be suspected in
patients presenting with recurrent renal stones, nephrocalcinosis, and
oxalate crystals in the urine after ruling out possible secondary causes
(e.g., gastrointestinal disorders or dietary causes). Laboratory studies
will reveal elevated urinary oxalate excretion, high urinary glycolate,
and elevated plasma oxalate. Confirmatory testing of AGXT as a single
gene or part of a multigene panel will secure the ultimate diagnosis.
The most common pathogenic variant in patients with high residual
enzyme activity (c.508G>A, p.Gly170Arg) results in mislocalization
of the enzyme to mitochondria instead of peroxisomes, thus leading
to the loss of in vivo function. Prenatal diagnosis has been achieved

839

by DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples when biallelic pathogenic
variants are known.
Treatment focuses on the reduction of oxalic acid production and
on improving calcium oxalate disposal. Patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 should receive a 3-­month trial of pyridoxine treatment to establish pyridoxine responsiveness. In up to 30% of patients
(e.g., those homozygous for the AGXT pathogenic variant c.508G>A),
administration of large doses of pyridoxine can reduce the plasma level
and urinary excretion of oxalate. To increase calcium oxalate disposal
and prevent nephrolithiasis, high oral fluid intake (2-­3 L/m2/day while
controlling for fluid balance), urine alkalinization, phosphate supplementation, monitoring of vitamin C and vitamin D intake, and avoidance of drugs that can increase urinary calcium excretion (e.g., loop
diuretics) are recommended. Urinary stones should be managed by
experienced urologists, as excessive surgical trauma may contribute to
renal dysfunction. Renal function replacement strategies (e.g., hemodialysis) are used in some patients (e.g., to bridge patients to transplant
or when transplant is not a viable option).
Organ transplantation has emerged as the most definitive treatment. The decision to undergo kidney, liver, or liver-­kidney transplant
is complex, and referral rates may vary from one medical center to
another. Except for older patients with the pyridoxine-­responsive form
of disease, renal transplantation alone in patients with renal failure
may not improve the outcome, because oxalosis can recur in the transplanted kidney. Combined liver-­kidney transplants have resulted in a
significant decrease in plasma and urinary oxalate and thus may be the
most effective treatment strategy, particularly in children.

Primary Hyperoxaluria type 2 (l-­Glyceric Aciduria)

This rare autosomal recessive condition is caused by a deficiency of
the glyoxylate reductase–hydroxypyruvate reductase enzyme complex
encoded by GRHPR (see Fig. 105.8). A deficiency in the activity of
this complex results in accumulation of two intermediate metabolites:
hydroxypyruvate (the ketoacid derivative of serine) and glyoxylic acid.
Both these compounds are further metabolized by LDH to l-­glycerate
and oxalate, respectively. A high prevalence of this disorder is reported
in the Saulteaux-­Ojibway Indians of Manitoba.
Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 results in the deposition of calcium
oxalate in the renal parenchyma and urinary tract. Renal stones presenting with renal colic and hematuria may develop before age 2 years.
Renal failure is less common in this condition than in primary hyperoxaluria type 1.
Urinary testing reveals large amounts of l-­glyceric acid in addition
to high levels of oxalate. Urinary l-­glyceric acid is considered a pathognomonic finding in primary hyperoxaluria type 2. Urinary excretion
of glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid is not increased. The presence of l-­
glyceric acid without increased levels of glycolic and glyoxylic acids in
urine differentiates this type from type 1 hyperoxaluria. The diagnosis
can be confirmed by molecular analysis of GRHPR or by the enzyme
assay in liver biopsy.
The principles of therapy are similar to those in primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Renal transplant is used in some patients; experience with
kidney-­liver transplantation is limited at this time.

Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 3

Approximately 10% of patients with primary hyperoxaluria have deficiency of 4-­hydroxy-­2-­oxoglutarate aldolase 1 (HOGA1), the underlying cause of hyperoxaluria type 3. The enzyme is encoded by HOGA1.
This mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes a step in the metabolic pathway of hydroxyproline that generates pyruvate and glyoxylate from
4-­hydroxy-­2-­oxoglutarate (HOG; see Figs. 105.8 and 105.9). In vitro
studies show inhibition of glyoxylate reductase–hydroxypyruvate
reductase enzyme activity by a high concentration of HOG that accumulates in patients with hyperoxaluria type 3. HOGA1 deficiency
results in a biochemical phenotype similar to primary hyperoxaluria
type 2 (see Fig. 105.8).
Patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 3 usually present with
calcium oxalate kidney stones in early childhood, but asymptomatic
older siblings have also been identified. Gradually, renal function may

decline, infrequently resulting in end-­stage renal disease. Increased levels of HOG in urine, serum, and liver biopsy samples of these patients
are the distinguishing feature of this disorder. Treatment involves high
oral fluid intake, management of oral citrate or phosphate intake to
prevent calcium oxalate renal stone formation, and avoidance of dehydration to prevent acute kidney injury. In severe forms of this disorder,
dialysis and transplantation may be required to address the end-­stage
renal disease.

Creatine Deficiency Disorders

Creatine is synthesized mainly in the liver, pancreas, and kidneys and
to a lesser degree in the brain from arginine and glycine and is transported to muscles and the brain, where there is high activity of the
enzyme creatine kinase (Fig. 105.10). Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of creatine in conjunction with adenosine triphosphate
and diphosphate provide high-­energy phosphate transfer reactions in
these organs. Creatine is nonenzymatically metabolized to creatinine
at a relatively constant daily rate and is excreted in the urine. Three
genetic conditions are known to cause creatine deficiency in the brain
and other tissues. Two enzymes, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase
(see Fig. 105.10; AGAT, encoded by GATM) and guanidinoacetate
methyltransferase (GAMT, encoded by GAMT), are involved in the
biosynthesis of creatine. Both conditions may respond to creatine
supplementation, especially when the treatment is started at an early
age. The third condition, an X-­linked inherited defect, is caused by a
deficiency of the creatinine transporter (CRTR, encoded by SLC6A8)
mediating uptake of creatine by the brain and muscle. A CRTR defect
is the most common cause of creatine deficiency, accounting for up to
1–2% of males with intellectual disability of unknown cause.
Clinical manifestations of the three defects overlap, relate to the
brain and muscle, and may appear in the first few weeks or months of
life. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, psychiatric symptoms (autism and psychosis), hypotonia, ataxia, and seizures
are common findings. Dystonic movements have been documented in
GAMT and CRTR deficiency.
Laboratory findings include decreased creatine in plasma in patients
with AGAT and GAMT defects. Plasma creatinine level alone is insufficient to diagnose these disorders. Secondary to impaired reabsorption of creatine in kidneys, the urinary ratio of creatine to creatinine is
increased in male patients with a CRTR defect but can also be mildly

elevated in female carriers. Marked elevations of guanidinoacetate
in the blood, urine, and especially in CSF are diagnostic of GAMT
defects. In contrast, low levels of guanidinoacetate can be found in
body fluids in the AGAT defect. Evidence of creatine and creatine
phosphate deficiency (in all three defects) and high levels of guanidinoacetate (in the GAMT defect) in the brain can be demonstrated by
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Brain MRI may show signal
hyperintensity in the globus pallidus. Diagnosis of AGAT deficiency or
GAMT deficiency may be confirmed by DNA analysis or by measuring enzymatic activity in cultured fibroblasts (GAMT) or lymphoblasts
(AGAT). The diagnosis of CRTR deficiency can be confirmed by DNA
analysis or a creatine uptake assay in fibroblasts.
The outcomes of treatment are age-­dependent, and the best outcomes are seen when treatment is started in the neonatal period or
presymptomatically. In AGAT-­deficient patients, oral creatine monohydrate (up to 400-­800 mg/kg/day) can improve muscle weakness,
seizures, and neurocognitive outcomes in some patients. In GAMT-­
deficient patients, supplementation with oral creatine monohydrate
(up to 400-­800 mg/kg/day), ornithine (up to 400-­800 mg/kg/day), and
dietary arginine restriction may result in improved muscle tone and
neurocognitive development and may alleviate seizures. In CRTR-­
deficient patients, administration of creatine monohydrate and its
precursors (arginine and glycine) may improve seizures and neurocognitive outcomes in some patients.

Serine is a nonessential amino acid supplied through dietary sources
and through endogenous synthesis, mainly from glucose and glycine.
The endogenous production of serine comprises an important portion
of the daily requirement of this amino acid, especially in the synaptic junctions, where it contributes to phospholipid metabolism of
d-­serine and glycine, both of which are involved in neurotransmission
(see Chapter 105.11). Consequently, deficiency of any of the enzymes

involved in the biosynthesis of serine or its transport causes neurologic
manifestations. The clinical spectrum of serine deficiency disorders
ranges widely and varies from Neu-­Laxova syndrome on the severe
end of spectrum to epilepsy and developmental delay on the milder
end. Affected patients respond favorably to oral supplementation with
serine and glycine when treatment is initiated very early in life. Figures
105.8 and 105.10 show the metabolic pathway for the synthesis and
catabolism of serine.

3-­PHOSPHOGLYCERATE DEHYDROGENASE

3-­Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH encoded by PHGDH)
deficiency has a broad range of symptoms and ages of presentation.
Neu-­Laxova syndrome type 1, an autosomal recessive condition, is
on the most severe end of the spectrum, presenting prenatally with
intrauterine growth restriction and congenital anomalies, including
dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, CNS malformations, limb
deformities, and ichthyosis. Most patients with this form are stillborn
or have early neonatal mortality. The infantile form of PHGDH deficiency can present with feeding problems, failure to thrive, vomiting,
irritability, seizures, severe developmental delay, and hypertonia progressing to spastic quadriplegia. Nystagmus, cataracts, hypogonadism, and megaloblastic anemia have been observed in some affected
infants. Patients with a milder form of this disorder experience cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, sensorineural polyneuropathy,
and childhood-­onset seizures.
Laboratory findings include low fasting levels of serine and glycine
in plasma and very low levels of serine and glycine in CSF. No abnormal
organic acid metabolite is found in the urine. MRI of the brain shows
cerebral atrophy with enlarged ventricles, significant attenuation of
white matter, and impaired myelination. Diagnosis can be confirmed
by DNA analysis or by measurement of the enzyme activity in cultured
fibroblasts. Treatment with high doses of serine (200-­700 mg/kg/day
orally) and glycine (200-­300 mg/kg/day) normalizes the serine levels
in the blood and CSF. When started postnatally, this treatment may
improve seizures, spasticity, and brain myelination. One case report
suggests that developmental delay may be prevented if the treatment
commences in the first days of life or prenatally.
If familial pathogenic variants are known, molecular prenatal diagnosis is possible. Administration of serine to a mother carrying an
affected fetus was associated with stabilization of the fetal head circumference, as evidenced by ultrasound. Treatment with supplemental
serine continued postnatally, and the patient remained normal neurologically at 4 years of age. The favorable response of this condition to a
relatively straightforward treatment makes this diagnosis an important
consideration in any child with microcephaly and neurologic defects
such as psychomotor delay or a seizure disorder. Measurements of
serine and glycine in the CSF are critical for diagnosis because mild
decreases of these amino acids in the plasma can be easily overlooked.

PHOSPHOSERINE AMINOTRANSFERASE
DEFICIENCY

Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1 encoded by PSAT1) catalyzes conversion of 3-­phosphohydroxypyruvate to 3-­phosphoserine
(see Fig. 105.10). Deficiency of this enzyme, an autosomal recessive
disorder, may present in the neonatal period with poor feeding, cyanotic episodes, and irritability and may progress to intractable, multifocal seizures and microcephaly. Brain imaging may reveal generalized
cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Laboratory studies done on postprandial plasma samples may reveal normal or mildly decreased levels of
serine and glycine. Serine and glycine levels are usually more depressed
on the CSF amino acid analysis. Treatment with serine and glycine as
outlined earlier may result in clinical improvement.

3-­PHOSPHOSERINE PHOSPHATASE DEFICIENCY

3-­Phosphoserine phosphatase catalyzes the final step in the l-­serine
synthesis, converting 3-­phosphoserine to l-­serine. Deficiency of this
enzyme results in an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical and
biochemical findings indistinguishable from the PHGDH and PSAT1

deficiencies. The disorder is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in
PSPH.

105.9 Proline
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Proline is a nonessential amino acid synthesized endogenously from
glutamic acid, ornithine, and arginine (see Fig. 105.9). Proline and
hydroxyproline are found in high concentrations in collagen. Normally, neither of these amino acids is found in large quantities in urine.
Excretion of proline and hydroxyproline as iminopeptides (dipeptides
and tripeptides containing proline or hydroxyproline) is increased in
disorders of accelerated collagen turnover, such as rickets or hyperparathyroidism. Proline is also found in synapses, where it can interact with
glycine and glutamate receptors (see Chapter 105.11). The catabolic
pathway of proline and hydroxyproline produces glyoxylic acid, which
can be further metabolized to glycine or oxalic acid (see Fig. 105.8).
Accumulation of proline in tissues is associated with disorders of
hyperprolinemia type 1 and hyperprolinemia type 2. Two types of
primary hyperprolinemia have been described. Reduced de novo synthesis of proline may manifest with cutis laxa (see Fig. 700.8) with
progeroid features or spastic paraplegia.

HYPERPROLINEMIA TYPE I

This rare autosomal recessive condition is caused by a deficiency of
proline oxidase (proline dehydrogenase; see Fig. 105.9). Most patients
with hyperprolinemia type 1 appear asymptomatic, although some may
present with intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral problems.
Hyperprolinemia may also be a risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The nature of such a wide phenotypic range
in this biochemical condition is incompletely understood. The gene
encoding proline oxidase (PRODH) is mapped to 22q11.2 within the
critical region for velocardiofacial syndrome. Laboratory studies reveal
high concentrations of proline in plasma, urine, and CSF. Increased
urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and glycine is also present, which
could be related to saturation of the shared tubular reabsorption mechanism due to massive prolinuria.
No effective treatment has yet emerged. Restriction of dietary proline
causes a modest improvement in plasma proline but with no proven
clinical benefit.

HYPERPROLINEMIA TYPE II

This is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by the deficiency of
Δ1-­pyrroline-­5-­carboxylate dehydrogenase (aldehyde dehydrogenase
4, ALDH4A1; see Fig. 105.9). Intellectual disability and seizures (usually precipitated by an intercurrent infection) have been reported in
affected children, but asymptomatic patients have also been described.
The cause for such disparate clinical outcomes is incompletely
understood.
Laboratory studies reveal increased concentrations of proline and
Δ1-­pyrroline-­5-­carboxylate (P5C) in blood, urine, and CSF. The presence of P5C differentiates this condition from hyperprolinemia type
I. An increased level of P5C in body fluids, especially in the CNS,
appears to antagonize vitamin B6 and leads to vitamin B6 dependency
(see Chapter 105.14). Vitamin B6 dependency may be the main cause of
seizures and neurologic findings in this condition and can explain the
variability in clinical manifestations in different patients. Treatment
with high doses of vitamin B6 is recommended.

PROLIDASE DEFICIENCY

During collagen degradation, imidodipeptides are formed and are normally cleaved by tissue prolidase. Prolidase deficiency, an autosomal
recessive condition caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in PEPD,
results in the accumulation of imidodipeptides in body fluids. The age
at onset varies from 6 months to the third decade of life.

842 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Clinical manifestations vary and include recurrent, severe, and
painful skin ulcers typically found on the hands and legs. Other skin
lesions may precede ulcers by several years and may include a scaly
erythematous maculopapular rash, purpura, and telangiectasia. Most
ulcers become infected. Healing of the ulcers may take months. Other
findings include developmental delays, intellectual disability, organomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and immune dysfunction resulting in increased susceptibility to infections (recurrent otitis media,
sinusitis, respiratory infection, splenomegaly). Some patients have craniofacial abnormalities such as ptosis, ocular proptosis, hypertelorism,
small beaked nose, and prominent cranial sutures. Asymptomatic cases
have also been reported. Increased incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus has been noted in children. High levels of urinary excretion of
imidodipeptides are diagnostic. The diagnosis can be confirmed using
DNA analysis. Enzyme assay may be performed in erythrocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts.
Treatment of prolidase deficiency is supportive. Infectious complications can be fatal and warrant close and proactive antibiotic
management. Oral supplementation with proline, ascorbic acid, and
manganese and topical proline and glycine have not been found to be
consistently effective in all patients.

DISORDERS OF DE NOVO PROLINE SYNTHESIS

De novo synthesis of proline and ornithine from glutamate appears to
be critical in the normal biology of connective tissue and to maintain
the urea cycle in a repleted state. Correspondingly, clinical manifestations of these disorders encompass connective tissue abnormalities,
nervous system abnormalities, and variable biochemical abnormalities
reflecting urea cycle dysfunction. Clinical and laboratory findings associated with the deficient function of Δ1-­P5C synthase (see Fig. 105.9),
encoded by ALDH18A1, and P5C, reductase encoded by PYCR1, are
discussed.
Deficient activity of P5C synthase has been associated with several
phenotypes, including de Barsy syndrome, characterized by cataracts,
growth restriction, intellectual disability, a prematurely aged appearance (progeroid features), and cutis laxa. Some patients may show
pyramidal signs. Skin biopsy may reveal decreased size of elastic fibers
and collagen abnormalities. Brain imaging studies show cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and reduced creatine. Laboratory findings
include reduced levels of proline, ornithine, citrulline, and arginine as
well as mild fasting hyperammonemia. Patients may show only intermittent abnormalities on the plasma amino acid profile, likely related
to the time of blood sampling in relation to the last meal. Interestingly,
both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of inheritance have been described. The diagnosis can be suspected in a patient
presenting with cutis laxa, developmental delay, mild hyperammonemia, and characteristic amino acid abnormalities. The diagnosis can be
confirmed using molecular DNA analysis or the glutamine loading test
on skin fibroblasts. Treatment is supportive, although supplementation
with citrulline or arginine to address hyperammonemia and cerebral
creatine depletion have been proposed.
Biallelic pathogenic variants in PYCR1 result in the abnormal function of the mitochondrial Δ1-­pyrroline-­5-­carboxylate reductase, which
catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of proline from P5C. The most
consistent finding in patients carrying proven pathogenic variants in
PYCR1 include triangular facies, cutis laxa (de Barsy–like syndrome),
joint hypermobility, wrinkled skin, gerodermia osteodysplastica, and
progeroid features. Skin biopsy reveals reduction of the elastic fibers
and infiltration with inflammatory cells. Some patients may have epilepsy, developmental delays, intellectual disability, cataracts, osteopenia, and failure to thrive. However, many of the affected families are
consanguineous, thus complicating interpretation of the phenotype. Of
note, plasma amino acid analysis reveals no specific abnormalities. The
diagnosis depends on the recognition of the skin findings and can be
confirmed using molecular DNA analysis. Available pedigrees of families affected by PYCR1-­related disorder supports the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

105.10 Glutamic Acid
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Glutamic acid and its amide derivative glutamine have a wide range
of functions in the body. Glutamate plays numerous biologic roles,
functioning as a neurotransmitter, an intermediate compound in
many fundamental biochemical reactions, and a precursor of an
inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-­aminobutyric acid (GABA) (see Chapter 105.11). Another major product of glutamate is glutathione (γ-­
glutamylcysteinylglycine). This ubiquitous tripeptide, with its function as
the major antioxidant in the body, is synthesized and degraded through
a complex cycle called the γ-­glutamyl cycle (Fig. 105.11). Because of its
free sulfhydryl (−SH) group and its abundance in the cell, glutathione
protects other sulfhydryl-­containing compounds (e.g., enzymes, coenzyme A) from oxidation. It is also involved in the detoxification of peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide, and in keeping the intracellular
milieu in a reduced state. In addition, glutathione participates in amino
acid transport across the cell membrane through the γ-­glutamyl cycle.
One of the biochemical manifestations of γ-­glutamyl cycle deficiency
is increased urinary excretion of 5-­oxoproline, which could be the
result of both genetic and nongenetic causes. 5-­Oxoprolinemia should
be routinely considered in the differential diagnosis of high–anion gap
metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). Two metabolic disorders can present with massive 5-­oxoprolinuria: glutathione synthetase deficiency
and 5-­oxoprolinase deficiency (see Fig. 105.11). However, a more
common clinical scenario is a transient and mild urinary elevation of
5-­oxoproline that can be seen in a variety of metabolic and acquired
conditions, such as exposure to acetaminophen and some hydrolyzed-­
protein formulas, severe burns, Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, homocystinuria, urea cycle defects, and tyrosinemia type I.

GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY

Three forms of this rare autosomal recessive condition have been
reported. In the mild form, glutathione synthetase deficiency causes
glutathione deficiency in erythrocytes. These patients present with
hemolytic anemia without chronic metabolic acidosis and demonstrate high residual activity of glutathione synthetase on enzymatic
testing. A moderate form has also been observed in which the
hemolytic anemia is associated with variable degrees of metabolic
acidosis and 5-­oxoprolinuria. Its severe form is distinguished by the
presence of hemolytic anemia accompanied by severe acidosis, massive
5-­oxoprolinuria, and neurologic manifestations.

Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency, Moderate and
Severe Forms

Affected newborn infants with severe and moderate forms of glutathione synthetase deficiency usually develop acute symptoms of metabolic acidosis, jaundice, and mild to moderate hemolytic anemia in the
first days of life. Chronic acidosis continues after recovery. Similar episodes of life-­threatening acidosis may occur during an infection (e.g.,
gastroenteritis) or after a surgical procedure. Progressive neurologic
damage develops with age, manifested by intellectual disability, spastic
tetraparesis, ataxia, tremor, dysarthria, and seizures. Susceptibility to
infections, presumably because of granulocyte dysfunction, is observed
in some patients. Patients with the moderate form of glutathione synthetase deficiency have milder acidosis and less 5-­oxoprolinuria than is
seen in the severe form, with few neurologic manifestations.
Laboratory findings include metabolic acidosis, mild to moderate
degrees of hemolytic anemia, and 5-­oxoprolinuria. High concentrations of 5-­oxoproline are also found in the blood. The urinary and blood
levels of 5-­oxoproline are less pronounced in patients with the moderate form of the condition. The glutathione content of erythrocytes is
markedly decreased. Increased synthesis of 5-­oxoproline in this disorder is thought to be the result of the conversion of γ-­glutamylcysteine
to 5-­oxoproline by the enzyme γ-­glutamyl cyclotransferase (see Fig.
105.11). γ-­Glutamylcysteine production increases greatly because the
normal inhibitory effect of glutathione on the γ-­glutamylcysteine synthetase enzyme is removed.

glutamate decarboxylase, (7) γ-­aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase, (8) succinate-­semialdehyde dehydrogenase, (9) glutamine synthetase, (10)
dipeptidase.

Treatment of acute attack includes hydration, correction of acidosis
(by infusion of sodium bicarbonate), and measures to correct anemia
and hyperbilirubinemia. Chronic administration of alkali is usually
needed indefinitely. Supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, and
selenium is recommended. Drugs and oxidants known to cause hemolysis and stressful catabolic states should be avoided. Oral administration of glutathione analogs has been tried with variable success.
Prenatal diagnosis can be achieved by the measurement of
5-­oxoproline in amniotic fluid, by enzyme analysis in cultured amniocytes or chronic villus samples, or by GSS gene analysis. Successful
pregnancy in an affected female (moderate form) has been reported,
with favorable outcomes for both mother and infant.

Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency, Mild Form

The mild form has been reported in only a few patients. Mild to moderate hemolytic anemia has been the only clinical finding. Splenomegaly
has been reported in some patients. Cognitive development is normal.
Chronic metabolic acidosis typically is not seen. Some patients can have
increased concentrations of 5-­oxoproline in the urine. Biallelic pathogenic variants in GSS, the gene encoding the enzyme, appear to decrease
the half-­life of the enzyme, causing an increased rate of protein turnover
without affecting its catalytic function. The expedited rate of enzyme
turnover caused by these pathogenic variants is of little or no consequence for tissues with protein synthetic capability. However, inability
of mature erythrocytes to synthesize protein results in glutathione deficiency in the erythrocytes. Treatment is that of hemolytic anemia and
avoidance of drugs and oxidants that can trigger the hemolytic process.

All forms of glutathione synthetase deficiency are inherited as an
autosomal recessive trait. Diagnosis can be confirmed by GSS gene
analysis or enzyme activity in erythrocytes or skin fibroblasts.

5-­Oxoprolinase Deficiency

More than 20 patients with 5-­
oxoprolinuria (4-­
10 g/day) caused
by 5-­oxoprolinase (see Fig. 105.11) deficiency (OPLAH) have been
described. No specific clinical picture has yet emerged; completely
asymptomatic affected individuals have also been identified. It is therefore not clear whether 5-­oxoprolinase deficiency is of any clinical consequence. No treatment is currently recommended.

γ-­Glutamylcysteine Synthetase Deficiency
(Glutamate-­Cysteine Ligase Deficiency)

γ-­Glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency is an autosomal recessive
disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GCLC. Only a few
patients with this enzyme deficiency have been reported. The most
consistent clinical manifestation has been mild chronic hemolytic
anemia. Acute attacks of hemolysis have occurred after exposure
to sulfonamides. Peripheral neuropathy and progressive spinocerebellar degeneration have been noted in two siblings in adulthood.
Laboratory findings of chronic hemolytic anemia were present in
all patients. Generalized aminoaciduria is also found because the γ-­
glutamyl cycle is involved in amino acid transport in cells (see Fig.
105.11). Treatment focuses on the management of hemolytic anemia
and avoidance of drugs and oxidants that may trigger the hemolytic
process.

844 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
γ-­GLUTAMYL TRANSPEPTIDASE DEFICIENCY
(GLUTATHIONEMIA)

GENETIC DISORDERS OF METABOLISM OF γ-­
AMINOBUTYRIC ACID

In the severe form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (infantile parkinsonism, infantile encephalopathy, or type B), the clinical manifestations occur at birth or shortly thereafter and include microcephaly,
developmental delay, involuntary movements of the limbs with spasticity, dystonia, ptosis, expressionless face, oculogyric crises (upward
eye-­
rolling movements), and autonomic dysfunction (temperature
instability, excessive sweating, hypoglycemia, salivation, tremor, gastrointestinal reflux, constipation). Brisk reflexes, myoclonus, athetosis,
and distal chorea may be present. The patient with the severe form usually shows incomplete response to treatment with l-­dopa and is prone
to developing l-­dopa–induced dyskinesia as a side effect.
Laboratory findings include reduced levels of dopamine and its
metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) and normal concentrations of
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), neopterin, and 5-­hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-­HIAA, a metabolite of serotonin) in the CSF. Serum prolactin levels
are usually elevated. These findings are not diagnostic of the condition;
diagnosis should be established by molecular gene analysis.
Treatment with l-­
dopa/carbidopa results in significant clinical
improvement in most patients, but the severe forms are invariably
associated with l-­dopa–induced dyskinesias. To minimize the side
effects of therapy, treatment should be started with a low dose and, if
needed, increased very slowly. Other therapeutic interventions include
anticholinergics, serotonergic agents, and monoamine oxidase (MAO)
B inhibitors, including amantadine, biperiden, and selegiline. Bilateral
subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation has shown clinical efficacy
in one case. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Molecular testing for pathogenic variants in the TH
gene is available clinically.

AROMATIC l-­AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE
DEFICIENCY

γ-­Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is expressed in any cell that has
secretory or absorptive functions. It is especially abundant in the kidneys, pancreas, intestines, and liver. The enzyme is also present in the
bile. Measurement of GGT in the blood is frequently performed to
evaluate for liver and bile duct diseases.
GGT deficiency causes elevation in glutathione concentrations in
body fluids, but the cellular levels remain normal (see Fig. 105.11).
Because only a few patients with GGT deficiency have been reported,
the scope of clinical manifestations has not yet been defined. Mild to
moderate intellectual disability and severe behavioral problems were
observed in three patients. However, one of two sisters with this condition had normal intelligence as an adult, and the other had Prader-­
Willi syndrome.
Laboratory findings include marked elevations in urinary glutathione (up to 1 g/day), γ-­glutamylcysteine, and cysteine. None of the
reported patients have had generalized aminoaciduria, a finding that
would have been expected to occur in this enzyme deficiency (see
Fig. 105.11).
Diagnosis can be confirmed by measurement of the enzyme activity in leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts. No effective treatment has
been proposed. The condition is inherited as an apparent autosomal
recessive trait. The γ-­glutamyl transpeptidases represent a large family
of enzymes encoded by at least seven genes.

See Chapter 105.11.

105.11 Disorders of Neurotransmitter
Metabolism
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Neurotransmitters are chemical substances released from the axonal
end of excited neurons at the synaptic junctions; they mediate initiation, amplification, or inhibition of neural impulses. Several amino
acids and their metabolites act as neurotransmitters in the central and
peripheral nervous system. Pathogenic variants in genes responsible for
the synthesis, transport, or degradation of these substances may cause
conditions that manifest neurologic and/or psychiatric abnormalities
(Table 105.3). Previously, children affected by disorders of neurotransmitters have been given syndromic diagnoses such as cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, parkinsonism, dystonia, or autism. Diagnosis, in most cases,
requires specialized laboratory studies of the CSF, because some of the
neurotransmitters generated in the CNS, dopamine and serotonin, do
not cross the BBB, and their abnormal concentrations are not detected
in the serum or urine.

TYROSINE HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY (INFANTILE
PARKINSONISM, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE DOPA-­
RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SEGAWA SYNDROME)

Tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzes the formation of l-­dopa from tyrosine.
Deficiency of this enzyme results in deficiencies of dopamine and norepinephrine (see Fig. 105.2 and Fig. 105.12). The differential diagnosis includes a wide range of inherited dystonias, including autosomal
dominant dystonia caused by GTP cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency.
Clinical manifestations range from mild to very severe. In general, two phenotypes have been recognized. In the mild form (dopa-­
responsive dystonia, or type A), symptoms of unilateral limb dystonia
causing gait incoordination and postural tremor occur in childhood
and worsen with age when the condition remains untreated. Diurnal
variation of symptoms (worse at the end of the day) may be present.
Cognitive development is usually normal.

Aromatic l-­amino acid decarboxylase (AADC encoded by DDC) is
a vitamin B6–dependent enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation
of both 5-­hydroxytryptophan to form serotonin (see Fig. 105.5 and
Fig. 105.12) and l-­dopa to generate dopamine (see Fig. 105.2 and Fig.
105.12). Clinical manifestations of this autosomal recessive disorder
reflect the reduced availability of dopamine and serotonin. Poor feeding, lethargy, hypotension, hypothermia, oculogyric crises, and ptosis
have been observed in affected neonates. Clinical findings in infants
and older children include developmental delay, truncal hypotonia
with hypertonia of limbs, oculogyric crises, extrapyramidal movements
(choreoathetosis, dystonia, myoclonus), and autonomic abnormalities
(sweating, salivation, irritability, temperature instability, hypotension).
Symptoms may have a diurnal variation, becoming worse by the end
of the day.
Laboratory findings include decreased concentrations of dopamine and serotonin and their metabolites (HVA, 5-­HIAA, norepinephrine, vanillylmandelic acid [VMA]) and increased levels of
5-­hydroxytryptophan, l-­dopa, and its metabolite (3-­O-­methyldopa)
in body fluids, especially in CSF. Elevated serum concentrations of
prolactin (the result of dopamine deficiency) have also been observed.
Brain MRI reveals cerebral atrophy with degenerative changes in the
white matter. A urine screening program, focused on 3-­O-­methyl-­dopa
and VMA, has demonstrated diagnostic promise in high-­
disease-­
prevalence populations.
Treatment with neurotransmitter precursors has produced limited
clinical improvement. Dopamine and serotonin have no therapeutic
value because of their inability to cross the BBB. Nonergot dopamine
agonists, MAO inhibitors (tranylcypromine), serotonergic agents, and
high doses of pyridoxine/pyridoxal phosphate, a cofactor for the AADC
enzyme, are preferred. The demonstration of putamen-­directed gene
therapy with an adeno-­associated viral vector has shown some benefit
in patients. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis after in vitro fertilization
has been achieved in the high-­prevalence Taiwanese population.

TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN DEFICIENCY

tissues (see Fig. 105.1). Deficiencies of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of BH4 result in inadequate production of this cofactor, which
causes deficiencies of monoamine neurotransmitters with or without
concomitant hyperphenylalaninemia.

rate-­limiting step in the biopterin biosynthesis pathway (see Fig. 105.1).
This form of dystonia, caused by GTP cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency
(GCH1), has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and is more
common in females than in males (4:1 ratio) (see Chapter 637.4). Clinical
manifestations usually start in early childhood with tremor and dystonia
of the lower limbs (toe gait), which may spread to all extremities within
a few years. Torticollis, dystonia of the arms, and poor coordination may
precede dystonia of the lower limbs. Early development is generally normal. Symptoms have an impressive diurnal variation, becoming worse
by the end of the day and improving with sleep. Autonomic instability is
common. Parkinsonism may also be present or develop with advancing
age. Late presentation in adult life has also been reported, associated with
action dystonia (“writer’s cramp”), torticollis, or generalized rigid hypertonia with tremor but without postural dystonia. Additionally, limited
data on adults suggest symptoms related to serotonin deficiency (sleep
disturbance, cognitive impairment, impulsivity).
Laboratory findings show reduced levels of BH4 and neopterin in
the CSF without hyperphenylalaninemia (not to be confused with the
autosomal recessive form of BH4-­deficient hyperphenylalaninemia,
see Chapter 105.1). Dopamine and its metabolite (HVA) may also
be reduced in CSF. The serotonergic pathway is less affected by this
enzyme deficiency; thus concentrations of serotonin and its metabolites are usually normal. Plasma phenylalanine is normal, but an oral
phenylalanine loading test (100 mg/kg) produces an abnormally high
plasma phenylalanine level with an elevated phenylalanine/tyrosine
ratio. The ratio, obtained 2-­3 hours after the load, in combination with
urine neopterin level, has optimal diagnostic specificity and sensitivity.
The existence of asymptomatic carriers indicates that other factors or
genes may play a role in pathogenesis. Asymptomatic carriers may be
identified using molecular testing or by the phenylalanine loading test.
Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating reduced levels of BH4 and
neopterin in CSF, measurement of the enzyme activity, and molecular
genetic analysis of GCH1 (see Chapter 105.1). Clinically, the condition
should be differentiated from other causes of dystonias and childhood
parkinsonism, especially tyrosine hydroxylase, sepiapterin reductase,
and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase deficiencies.
Treatment with l-­dopa/carbidopa usually produces dramatic clinical improvement. Oral administration of BH4 is also effective but is
rarely used.

Sepiapterin Reductase Deficiency

Sepiapterin reductase (encoded by SPR) is involved in the conversion of
6-­pyruvoyl-­tetrahydropterin to BH4. It also participates in the salvage
pathway of BH4 synthesis (see Fig. 105.1 and Fig. 105.12). Sepiapterin
reductase deficiency, an autosomal recessive condition, results in accumulation of 6-­lactoyl-­tetrahydropterin, which can be converted to
sepiapterin nonenzymatically. The majority of sepiapterin is metabolized to BH4 through the salvage pathway in peripheral tissues (see Fig.
105.1 and Fig. 105.12), but because of the low activity of dihydrofolate reductase in the brain, the amount of BH4 remains insufficient for
proper synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. This explains the absence
of hyperphenylalaninemia and the often-­delayed diagnosis.

Clinical manifestations in severely affected patients usually appear
within a few months of life. Cardinal manifestations include paroxysmal stiffening, oculogyric crises, and hypotonia. Additional findings
include motor and language delays, weakness, limb hypertonia, dystonia, hyperreflexia, and early-­onset parkinsonism. The symptoms
usually have a diurnal variation. Misdiagnosis as cerebral palsy is common, and a wide variability of symptoms has been reported. Diagnosis
is established by measurement of CSF neurotransmitters and pterin
metabolites, which reveal decreased dopamine, HVA, norepinephrine,
and 5-­HIAA and marked elevations of sepiapterin and dihydrobiopterin. The serum concentration of prolactin may be elevated. The
phenylalanine loading test may have diagnostic utility, but it is being
replaced by molecular genetic analysis, which can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment with slowly increasing doses of L-­dopa/carbidopa and
5-­hydroxytryptophan usually produces dramatic clinical improvement.

DOPAMINE β-­HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY

Dopamine β-­hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to
norepinephrine (see Fig. 105.2 and Fig. 105.12). The deficiency of
this enzyme results in reduced or absent synthesis of norepinephrine,
leading to dysregulation of the sympathetic function. Infants and children may present with difficulty opening the eyes, ptosis, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and nasal stuffiness. Adult patients
may present with profound deficits of autonomic regulation, resulting
in severe orthostatic hypotension, and sexual dysfunction in males.
Presyncopal symptomatology includes dizziness, blurred vision, dyspnea, nuchal discomfort, and chest pain; olfactory function remains
relatively intact. The diagnosis can be aided by performing autonomic
function testing (measurement of the sinus arrhythmia ratio, blood
pressure studies during controlled hyperventilation, Valsalva maneuver, cold pressor, handgrip exercise). Laboratory findings include
decreased or absent norepinephrine and epinephrine and their metabolites, with elevated levels of dopamine and its metabolite (HVA), in
plasma, CSF, and urine. Elevated plasma dopamine may be pathognomonic for this disease. MRI of the brain shows decreased brain volume,
consistent with the neurotrophic role of norepinephrine. Treatment
with l-­dihydroxyphenylserine, which is converted to norepinephrine
directly in vivo by the action of AADC, leads to significant improvement in orthostatic hypotension and normalizes noradrenaline and its
metabolites. The condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
Dopamine β-­hydroxylase is encoded by DBH.

MONOAMINE OXIDASE A DEFICIENCY

The human genome encodes two MAO isoenzymes: MAO A and MAO
B. Both enzymes catalyze oxidative deamination of most biogenic
amines in the body, including serotonin (see Fig. 105.5 and Fig. 105.12),
norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine (see Fig. 105.2 and Fig.
105.12). The genes for both isoenzymes are on the X chromosome
(Xp11.3). A deletion of both genes can also encompass a neighboring
gene, NDP, resulting in a contiguous deletion syndrome, which can
present as an atypical Norrie disease (see Chapter 640). Male patients
with MAO A deficiency manifest borderline intellectual deficiency
and impaired impulse control. The consequences of the isolated MAO
B deficiency are incompletely understood. Combined MAO A and B
deficiency causes severe intellectual disability and behavioral problems
and can be associated with pronounced laboratory abnormalities (e.g.,
fourfold to sixfold serotonin elevation in physiologic fluids, elevated
O-­methylated amine metabolites, and reduced deamination products
[VMA, HVA]). Dietary intervention (low tyramine, phenylethylamine,
and l-­dopa/dopamine intake) did not improve patients’ blood serotonin levels. Inheritance of MAO deficiency is X-­linked. Treatment of
MAO A deficiency is supportive.

DISORDERS OF GABA METABOLISM

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesized in the synapses through decarboxylation of glutamic acid by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). The same pathway is responsible for production of
GABA in other organs, especially the kidneys and the β cells of the pancreas. The GAD enzyme requires pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor.

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids

847

Two GAD enzymes, GAD1 (GAD67) and GAD2 (GAD65), have been
identified. GAD1 is the main enzyme in the brain, and GAD2 is the
major enzyme in the β cells. Antibodies against GAD65 and GAD67
have been implicated in the development of type 1 diabetes and stiff-­
person syndrome, respectively. GABA is catabolized to succinic acid
by two enzymes: GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde
dehydrogenase (SSADH) (see Figs. 105.11 and 105.12).

through exocytosis. As expected, pathogenic variants in transporter
proteins interfere with the proper reuptake and storage of neurotransmitters and may result in clinical manifestations similar to those seen in
deficiencies of neurotransmitter metabolism. Several conditions caused
by pathogenic variants of neurotransmitter protein transporters have
been described, including dopamine transporter protein deficiency and
dopamine-­serotonin vesicular transporter disease.

GABA Transaminase Deficiency

SLC6A3-­Related Dopamine Transporter Protein
Deficiency

Clinical manifestations in the two index infant siblings included severe
developmental delay and intellectual disability, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, lethargy, refractory seizures, and increased linear growth likely
related to GABA-­mediated increased secretion of growth hormone.
Increased concentrations of GABA and β-­alanine were found in the
CSF (see Fig. 105.11 and Fig. 105.12). Evidence of leukodystrophy was
noted in the postmortem examination of the brain. A third patient
showed severe psychomotor retardation, recurrent episodic lethargy,
and intractable seizures with comparable CSF metabolite abnormalities
to those of the index probands. GABA transaminase deficiency is demonstrated in the brain and lymphocytes. Treatment is symptomatic.
Intervention with vitamin B6, the cofactor for the enzyme, was without
therapeutic benefit. The condition is inherited in the autosomal recessive manner and caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ABAT.

Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency
(β-­Hydroxybutyric Aciduria)

Clinical manifestations of SSADH deficiency, an autosomal recessive
disorder, usually begin in infancy with developmental delays with a
disproportionate deficit in expressive language, hypotonia, and ataxia;
seizures occur in approximately 50% of patients (see Fig. 105.11 and
Fig. 105.12). Many patients also carry the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Neuropsychiatric comorbidity (especially oppositional
defiance, obsession-­compulsion, and hyperactivity) can be disabling,
particularly in adolescents and adults. Abnormal EEG findings include
background slowing and generalized spike-­wave paroxysms, with variable lateralization in hemispheric onset and voltage predominance.
Photosensitivity and electrographic status epilepticus of sleep have
been reported in combination with difficulties in sleep maintenance
and excessive daytime somnolence. Brain MRI shows an increased T2-­
weighted hyperintensity involving the globus pallidi, cerebellar dentate nuclei, and subthalamic nuclei, usually in a bilaterally symmetric
distribution.
The biochemical hallmark, γ-­hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), is elevated
in physiologic fluids (CSF, plasma, urine) in all patients. Increased concentrations of GABA are also found in the CSF. Heightened diagnostic
suspicion evolves through documentation of elevated urinary GHB,
and confirmation is achieved by molecular genetic testing.
Effective treatment is lacking. Vigabatrin (a GABA-­transaminase
inhibitor) has been employed empirically, with mixed outcomes, and
there is concern with its use, as it further elevates CNS GABA in an
already hyper-­GABAergic disorder. Additionally, vigabatrin can cause
constriction of the visual field, and long-­term use is contraindicated.
SSADH is encoded by ALDH5A1, and inheritance follows an autosomal recessive pattern. Prenatal diagnosis has been achieved by measurement of GHB in the amniotic fluid, assay of the enzyme activity in
the amniocytes, chorionic villus sampling, or DNA analysis.

DEFECTS IN NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTER
PROTEINS

More than 20 different proteins are involved in transporting neurotransmitters across the neuronal membranes. The main function of most of
these transporters is to remove excess neurotransmitters from the synaptic junction into the presynaptic neurons (reuptake). This recycling
process not only regulates the precise effect of neurotransmitters at the
synaptic junction but also resupplies the presynaptic neurons with neurotransmitters for future use. A few transporter proteins are involved
in shuttling neurotransmitters from the neuronal cytoplasm across the
membrane of synaptic vesicles for storage (vesicular transporters). On
neuronal stimulation, these vesicles release a bolus of neurotransmitters

This transporter protein is involved in the reuptake of dopamine by the
presynaptic neurons, and its deficiency causes depletion of dopamine
and thus a dopamine-­deficient state. The dopamine transporter protein (DAT) is encoded by SLC6A3. Children with biallelic pathogenic
variants in SLC6A3 present with symptoms of infantile parkinsonism-­
dystonia syndrome. Irritability and feeding difficulties start shortly
after birth and progress to hypotonia, lack of head control, parkinsonism, dystonia, and global developmental delay by early infancy. Brain
MRI usually shows no abnormalities.
CSF examination reveals elevation of HVA and a normal level of
5-­HIAAs. The urinary level of HVA and serum concentration of prolactin are increased. Diagnosis can be established by demonstrating
loss-­of-­function pathogenic variants in the SLC6A3 gene.

Dopamine-­Serotonin Vesicular Transporter Disease
(Vesicular Monoamine Transporter Deficiency)

This autosomal recessive condition is caused by pathogenic variants in
the SLC18A2 gene. This gene encodes the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) involved in transporting dopamine and serotonin
from the cytoplasm into the synaptic storage vesicles located in the
axonal terminals of the presynaptic neurons. Most affected children
presented in the first year of life with symptoms consistent with deficiencies of dopamine (hypotonia progressing into dystonia, parkinsonism, oculogyric crises), serotonin (sleep and psychiatric disturbances),
and norepinephrine-­epinephrine (excessive sweating, tremors, temperature instability, postural hypotension, ptosis). Neurocognitive
delays become apparent in the first year of life. No diurnal variation
of the symptoms was noted. Brain imaging studies were within normal limits. Changes in the levels of CNS neurotransmitters and their
metabolites have been inconsistent.
The phenotype resembles that seen in AADC and BH4 deficiencies.
Diagnosis requires demonstration of biallelic pathogenic variants in
SLC18A2. Treatment with l-­dopa/carbidopa caused exacerbation of
symptoms, whereas pramipexole, a dopamine receptor agonist, has
resulted in a promising clinical response.

HISTIDINE DECARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY

Decarboxylation of histidine by histidine decarboxylase produces histamine, which functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Deficiency
of this enzyme (expressed mainly in the posterior hypothalamus)
results in deficiency of histamine in the CNS and in one family has
been reported as an autosomal dominant form of Tourette syndrome
(see Chapter 105.13).

HYPERPROLINEMIA

Intellectual disability and seizures are common findings in most
patients with hyperprolinemia types I and II. Patients with type I
hyperprolinemia typically show a benign clinical course but could have
an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. The contribution of
increased concentrations of proline to the mechanisms of schizophrenia, however, remains unclear. The neurologic abnormalities observed
in hyperprolinemia type II are mainly caused by development of vitamin B6 dependency in this condition (see Chapter 105.9). Dietary
intervention in hyperprolinemia type I and II is neither feasible nor
recommended.

GENETIC CAUSES OF HYPERAMMONEMIA

Hyperammonemia, sometimes severe, occurs in inborn errors of
metabolism other than the urea cycle defects (Table 105.5; see also
Table 104.5). The mechanisms of hyperammonemia in some of these
conditions are diverse and include accumulation of toxic metabolites
(e.g., organic acids), impaired transport of urea cycle intermediates
(e.g., HHH syndrome), or depletion of urea cycle intermediates (e.g.,
lysinuric protein intolerance), leading to compromised function of the
urea cycle.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF
HYPERAMMONEMIA

105.12 Urea Cycle and Hyperammonemia
(Arginine, Citrulline, Ornithine)

In the neonatal period, symptoms and signs are mostly related
to brain dysfunction and are similar regardless of the cause of the
hyperammonemia. The affected infant appears healthy at birth but
becomes symptomatic in the first days of life, often following the
introduction of dietary protein. Refusal to eat, vomiting, tachypnea,
and lethargy can quickly progress to a deep coma. Seizures are common. Physical examination may reveal hepatomegaly in addition to
obtundation. Hyperammonemia can trigger increased intracranial
pressure that may be manifested by a bulging fontanelle and dilated
pupils.
In infants and older children, acute hyperammonemia is manifested by vomiting and neurologic abnormalities such as ataxia, confusion, agitation, irritability, combativeness, and psychosis. These
manifestations may alternate with periods of lethargy and somnolence
that may progress to coma.

Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Catabolism of amino acids results in the production of free ammonia,
which in high concentrations is toxic to the CNS. Mammals detoxify
ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle
(Fig. 105.13). It is composed of five enzymes: carbamoyl phosphate
synthetase 1 (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), and arginase 1 (ARG1). A sixth enzyme, N-­acetylglutamate (NAG) synthetase
(NAGS), catalyzes synthesis of NAG, an obligatory activator (effector)
of the CPS1 enzyme. Individual deficiencies of these enzymes have
been observed and, with an overall estimated prevalence of 1 in 35,000
live births, they are the most common genetic causes of hyperammonemia in infants (Table 105.4).

Psychiatric Disease, 6th ed. Vol. 1. London: Elsevier; 2020: Table 61.1.

Routine laboratory studies show no specific findings when hyperammonemia is caused by defects of the urea cycle enzymes. Blood urea
nitrogen is usually low-­normal or low in these patients. Some patients
may initially present with unexplained elevated serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) and even meet the
criteria for acute liver failure. In infants with organic acidemias, hyperammonemia is commonly associated with severe acidosis and ketonuria. Newborn infants with hyperammonemia are often misdiagnosed
as having sepsis; they may succumb without a correct diagnosis. Neuroimaging may reveal cerebral edema. Autopsy may reveal microvesicular steatosis, mild cholestasis, and fibrosis of the liver. Thus because
of the nonspecific presentation or urea cycle disorders, it is imperative to measure plasma ammonia levels in any ill infant with severe
sepsis, unexplained liver dysfunction, recurrent emesis, or progressive
encephalopathy.

DIAGNOSIS

The main criterion for diagnosis is hyperammonemia. Each clinical
laboratory should establish its own normal values for blood ammonia.

Normal newborn values are higher than those of the older child or
adult. Occasionally, levels as high as 100 μmol/L can occur in healthy
term infants. An ill infant usually manifests a blood ammonia level
>150 μmol/L. Figure 105.14 illustrates an approach to the differential
diagnosis of hyperammonemia in the newborn infant. Careful inspection of individual plasma amino acid profiles usually reveals abnormalities that assist in diagnosis. In patients with deficiencies of CPS1, OTC,
or NAGS, frequent findings include elevations in plasma glutamine
and alanine with concurrent decrements in citrulline and arginine.
These disorders cannot be differentiated from one another by plasma
amino acid levels alone. A marked increase in urinary orotic acid in
patients with OTC deficiency helps differentiate this defect from CPS1
deficiency (see Table 105.4). Differentiation between the CPS1 deficiency and the NAGS deficiency may require molecular analysis of
the relevant genes or, infrequently, an assay of the respective enzyme.
Significant clinical improvement occurring after oral administration of carbamylglutamate, however, supports the diagnosis of NAGS
deficiency. Patients with a deficiency of ASS, ASL, or arginase 1 have
marked increases in the plasma levels of citrulline, argininosuccinic

acid, or arginine, respectively. The combination of hyperammonemia
and marked hypercitrullinemia or argininosuccinic acidemia is virtually pathognomonic for these disorders. Additional clinical clues may
come from the past medical history. Children with urea cycle defects
often self-­select a low-­protein, high-­carbohydrate diet, especially those
with late-­onset disease or symptomatic females with partial OTC
deficiency.
Because of the nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings, mass
screening of newborn infants has been implemented in many countries,
which can identify patients with ASS, ASL, and arginase 1 deficiencies.

TREATMENT OF ACUTE HYPERAMMONEMIA

The clinical outcome depends mainly on the severity and the duration
of hyperammonemia. Serious neurologic sequelae are likely in newborns with severe elevations in blood ammonia (>300 μmol/L) lasting
more than 12 hours. Thus acute hyperammonemia should be treated
promptly and vigorously. The goal of therapy is to lower the concentration of ammonia. This is accomplished by (1) temporarily restricting dietary sources of ammonia (protein), (2) minimizing endogenous
protein breakdown and favoring endogenous protein synthesis by providing adequate calories and essential amino acids, and (3) removal
of ammonia from the body in a form other than urea (Table 105.6).
Fluid, electrolytes, glucose (10–15%), and lipids (1-­2 g/kg/day) should
be infused intravenously, together with minimal amounts of protein
(0.25 g/kg/day), preferably including essential amino acids. Oral feeding with a low-­protein formula (0.5-­1.0 g/kg/day) through a nasogastric tube should be started as soon as sufficient improvement is seen.
Because the kidneys clear ammonia poorly, its removal from the
body must be expedited by formation of compounds with a high renal
clearance. An important advance in the treatment of hyperammonemia
has been the introduction of nitrogen scavenging therapy by using
an exogenous organic acid that conjugates to endogenous nonessential amino acids (glycine and glutamine) to form nontoxic compounds
with high renal clearance. The main organic acids used for this purpose are sodium salts of benzoic acid and phenylacetic acid. Benzoate
forms hippurate through enzymatic conjugation with endogenous glycine in the liver (see Fig. 105.13). Each mole of benzoate removes one
mole of ammonia as glycine. Phenylacetate enzymatically conjugates
with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine readily excreted in the
urine. One mole of phenylacetate can remove two moles of ammonia

3.	Continue infusion of sodium benzoate† (250-­500 mg/kg/day), sodium
phenylacetate† (250-­500 mg/kg/day), and arginine (200-­600 mg/kg/
day‡) following the above priming doses. These compounds should
be added to the daily intravenous fluid.
4.	Initiate peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis if above treatment fails
to produce an appreciable decrease in plasma ammonia.

the amount of the sodium in the drugs.

‡The higher dose of the range is recommended in the treatment of patients with
citrullinemia and argininosuccinic aciduria. Arginine is not recommended in patients
with arginase deficiency and in those whose hyperammonemia is secondary to
organic acidemia. Sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate should be used with
caution in patients with organic acidemias.

intravenous (IV) use, a combined formulation of benzoate and phenylacetate (Ammonul) is commercially available.
Another valuable therapeutic adjunct is IV infusion of arginine,
which is effective in all patients except those with arginase deficiency.
Arginine administration supplies the urea cycle with ornithine (see
Fig. 105.13). In patients with citrullinemia, one mole of arginine reacts
with one mole of ammonia as carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline.
In patients with argininosuccinic acidemia, two moles of ammonia
(as carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate) react with arginine to form
argininosuccinic acid. Citrulline and arginosuccinate are less toxic
than ammonia and more readily excreted by the kidneys. In patients
with CPS1 or OTC deficiencies, arginine administration is indicated
because this amino acid is not produced in sufficient amounts to enable
endogenous protein synthesis. For enteral therapy, patients with OTC
deficiency benefit from supplementation with citrulline (200 mg/kg/
day) because one mole of citrulline reacts with one mole of ammonia
(through aspartic acid) to form arginine. Administration of arginine
or citrulline is contraindicated in patients with arginase deficiency, a
rare condition in which the spastic diplegia is a much more common
presenting feature rather than hyperammonemia. Arginine therapy is
of no benefit if hyperammonemia is secondary to an organic acidemia.
In a newborn infant with an initial episode of hyperammonemia, arginine should be used until the diagnosis is established (see Table 105.6).
Benzoate, phenylacetate, and arginine may be administered together
for maximal therapeutic effect. A priming dose of these compounds
is followed by continuous infusion until recovery from the acute state
occurs. Both benzoate and phenylacetate are usually supplied as concentrated solutions and should be properly diluted (1–2% solution)
for IV use. The recommended therapeutic doses of both compounds
deliver a substantial amount of sodium to the patient; this amount
should be included in the calculation of the daily sodium requirement.
Benzoate and phenylacetate (or the combined formulation) should be
used with caution in newborn infants with hyperbilirubinemia because
they may displace bilirubin from albumin; however, there are no documented cases of kernicterus (see Chapter 123.4) reported in neonates
with hyperammonemia who have received such therapies. In infants at
risk, it is advisable to monitor and manage bilirubin levels while considering IV administration of benzoate or phenylacetate.
If the initial ammonia level is <500 μmol/L and if the foregoing therapies fail within 4-­6 hours to produce any appreciable change in the
blood ammonia level, hemodialysis should be considered. For patients

presenting with an ammonia level >500 μmol/L, extracorporeal detoxification is the initial method of ammonia removal. Exchange transfusion has little effect on reducing total body ammonia. It should be
used only if dialysis cannot be employed promptly or when the patient
is a newborn infant with significant hyperbilirubinemia (see earlier).
Hemodialysis dramatically lowers blood ammonia within a few hours,
but if it is unavailable or technically unfeasible, peritoneal dialysis may
be used as a temporary solution. When hyperammonemia is caused
by an organic acidemia and hemodialysis is not available, peritoneal
dialysis can be used to remove both the offending organic acid and
ammonia.
Oral administration of neomycin limits the growth of intestinal bacteria that can produce ammonia. However, this modality is of limited
use in urea cycle patients (e.g., affected neonates) in whom reduction
of hyperammonemia is an urgent priority. Oral lactulose acidifies the
intestinal lumen, thereby reducing the diffusion of ammonia across the
intestinal epithelium. This agent is of limited applicability in newborns,
who have a high risk of acidemia and dehydration.
There may be considerable lag between the normalization of ammonia level and an improvement in the patient’s neurologic status. Several
days may be needed before the infant becomes fully alert.
There has been interest in the use of cooling as a therapeutic adjunct
in newborn infants with metabolic encephalopathy such as that caused
by hyperammonemia. Clinical studies are in progress to evaluate the
efficacy of this approach.

of hyperammonemia (refusal to eat, vomiting, lethargy, convulsion,
coma). Increased intracranial pressure is frequent. Late forms (as late
as the fourth decade of life) may present as an acute bout of hyperammonemia (lethargy, headache, seizures, psychosis) in a seemingly
healthy individual. Coma and death may occur during these episodes.
Diagnostic confusion with migraine is common. Intermediate forms
with intellectual disability and chronic subclinical hyperammonemia
interspersed with bouts of acute hyperammonemia have also been
observed.
Laboratory findings include hyperammonemia. The plasma amino
acid analysis typically shows a marked increase of glutamine and alanine with relatively low levels of citrulline and arginine. These are nondiagnostic changes that occur in hyperammonemia of diverse causes.
Urinary orotic acid is usually low or may be absent (see Fig. 105.14).
Treatment of acute hyperammonemic attacks and the long-­term
therapy of the condition are outlined earlier (see Table 105.6). Treatment with oral carbamylglutamate of patients with NAGS deficiency
can produce successful rescue of biochemical findings and symptoms.
It is therefore important to differentiate between CPS1 and NAGS deficiencies by gene analysis of CPS1 and NAGS, respectively.
CPS1 and NAGS deficiencies are both autosomal recessive conditions; the CPS1 enzyme is normally present in the liver and intestine.
Neither of these conditions can be reliably identified by the mass
screening of the newborn infants using current approaches.

Long-­Term Therapy

In this X-­linked disorder, the hemizygous males are more severely
affected than heterozygous females (see Figs. 105.13 and 105.14). The
heterozygous females may have a mild form of the disease, but the
majority (approximately 75%) remain asymptomatic, although investigations indicate subtle neurologic defects even in females without a
discernable history of hyperammonemia. OTC deficiency is the most
common form of all the urea cycle disorders, comprising approximately 40% of cases.
Clinical manifestations in a male newborn are usually those of
severe hyperammonemia (see earlier) occurring in the first few days of
life. Mild forms, such as in some heterozygous females, characteristically have episodic manifestations, which may occur at any age (usually
after infancy). Episodes of hyperammonemia, manifested by vomiting
and neurologic abnormalities (e.g., ataxia, mental confusion, agitation,
combativeness, frank psychosis), are separated by periods of wellness.
These episodes usually occur after ingestion of a high-­protein diet or as
a result of a catabolic state such as infection. Hyperammonemic coma,
cerebral edema, and death may occur during one of these attacks. Cognitive development may proceed normally. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, however, is common. Gallstones have been seen in the
survivors, although the mechanism remains unclear.
The major laboratory finding during the acute attack is hyperammonemia accompanied by marked elevations of plasma concentrations of glutamine and alanine with low levels of citrulline and
arginine. The blood level of urea is usually low. A marked increase in
the urinary excretion of orotic acid differentiates this condition from
CPS1 deficiency (see Fig. 105.14). Orotate may precipitate in urine as
pink-­colored crystals. In the mild form, these laboratory abnormalities may revert to normal between attacks. This form should be differentiated from all the episodic conditions of childhood. Patients with
lysinuric protein intolerance (see Chapter 105.14) may demonstrate
some features of OTC deficiency, but the former can be differentiated
by increased urinary excretion of lysine, ornithine, and arginine and
elevated blood concentrations of citrulline.
The prevalence of OTC deficiency is 1 in 56,000 to 1 in 77,000 live
births. This condition is not identifiable by the mass screening of newborn infants using current approaches. The diagnosis is most conveniently confirmed by OTC gene analysis. Many OTC pathogenic
variants (>300) have been identified. Genotype and degree of enzyme
deficiency determine the severity of the phenotype in most cases.
Mothers of affected infants are expected to be carriers of the mutant
gene unless a de novo pathogenic variant has occurred. A mother who
gave birth to two affected male offspring was found to have a normal

Once the acute hyperammonemic episode is under control, maintenance therapy should be tailored to address the underlying cause of
the hyperammonemia. All patients, regardless of the enzymatic defect,
require protein restriction limited to the age-­adjusted recommended
dietary allowance (RDA). In pediatric patients with urea cycle defects,
chronic administration of sodium benzoate (250 mg/kg/day), sodium
phenylbutyrate (250-­500 mg/kg/day), and arginine (200-­400 mg/kg/
day) or citrulline (in patients with OTC deficiency, 200-­400 mg/kg/
day) is effective in maintaining blood ammonia levels within the normal range (doses above are for patients who weigh <20 kg). Arginine
and citrulline are contraindicated in patients with argininemia. Patients
who have difficulty taking sodium phenylbutyrate can be trialed on
glycerol phenylbutyrate. This compound conceals the offensive odor
of sodium phenylbutyrate and may help with patient adherence. Benzoate and phenylacetate may lower carnitine levels, but clinical signs
of carnitine deficiency or benefit from carnitine supplementation have
not yet been demonstrated. These compounds have been used during
pregnancy without obvious teratogenic effect. However, experience is
still limited, and appropriate caution should be exercised.
Growth parameters, especially head circumference, and nutritional indices (blood albumin, prealbumin, pH, electrolytes, amino
acids, zinc, selenium) should be followed closely. Long-­term care of
these patients is best achieved by a team of experienced professionals (pediatrician, nutritionist, child neurologist, metabolic geneticist).
Skin lesions resembling acrodermatitis enteropathica (see Chapter
691) have been noted in a few patients with different types of urea cycle
defects, presumably resulting from the deficiency of essential amino
acids, caused by overzealous dietary protein restriction. Catabolic
states (infections, fasting) that may trigger hyperammonemia should be
avoided. They must be treated vigorously when they occur. It is important that all children with urea cycle defects avoid valproic acid because
this drug can elevate blood ammonia even in some healthy individuals.
In patients with CPS1, OTC, or ASS deficiency, acute hyperammonemic attacks may be precipitated by valproate administration.

CARBAMOYL PHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE 1 AND
N-­ACETYLGLUTAMATE SYNTHASE DEFICIENCIES

Without treatment, deficiencies of these two enzymes produce similar
clinical and biochemical manifestations (see Figs. 105.13 and 105.14).
There is a wide variation in the severity of symptoms and in the age at
presentation. In near-­complete enzymatic deficiency, symptoms appear
during the first few days or even hours of life with signs and symptoms

genotype, suggesting that gonadal mosaicism can be seen. As many
as 20% of affected patients demonstrate normal results by Sanger
sequencing, perhaps because the pathogenic variant involves copy
number variants, deep intronic regions, or a promoter sequence. Copy
number variants can be evaluated using a chromosomal microarray,
and if positive, a contiguous gene deletion should be considered. If the
molecular diagnostic approach is negative, a liver biopsy may be indicated. Prenatal diagnosis is feasible by analysis of DNA in amniocytes
or chorionic villus samples. Increase in urinary excretion of orotidine
after an allopurinol loading test can identify female carriers. Mild cerebral dysfunction may be present in asymptomatic female carriers. The
importance of a detailed family history cannot be overemphasized. A
history of migraine or protein aversion is common in maternal female
relatives of the proband. Indeed, careful scrutiny of the family history
may reveal a pattern of unexplained deaths in male newborns in the
maternal lineage.
Treatment of acute hyperammonemic attacks and the long-­term
therapy of the condition are as outlined earlier. For enteral use, citrulline is used in place of arginine for patients with OTC deficiency. Liver
transplantation is a surgical treatment option for patients with severe
OTC deficiency.

CITRULLINEMIA

Two clinically and genetically distinct forms of citrullinemia have
been described. The classic form (type I) is caused by the deficiency
of the ASS enzyme. Citrullinemia type II is caused by the deficiency
of a mitochondrial transport protein called citrin. (See Figs. 105.13
and 105.14.)

Citrullinemia Type I (Argininosuccinate Synthetase
Deficiency, Classic Citrullinemia)

This condition is caused by the deficiency of ASS (see Fig. 105.13) and
has variable clinical manifestations depending on the degree of the
enzyme deficiency. Two major forms of the condition have been identified. The severe or neonatal form, which is most common, appears in
the first few days of life with signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia
(see earlier). In the subacute or mild form, clinical findings such as
failure to thrive, frequent vomiting, developmental delay, and dry, brittle hair appear gradually after 1 year of age. Acute hyperammonemia,
triggered by an intercurrent catabolic state, may bring the diagnosis
to light.
Laboratory findings are similar to those found in patients with
OTC deficiency, except that the plasma citrulline concentration is
greatly elevated (50-­100 times the reference range) (see Fig. 105.14).
Urinary excretion of orotic acid is moderately increased; crystalluria
may also occur as a result of precipitation of orotates. The diagnosis is
confirmed by DNA analysis of ASS1 or, less frequently, by an assay of
enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts. Prenatal diagnosis is feasible
with an enzyme assay in cultured amniotic cells or by DNA analysis of
cells obtained from chorionic villus biopsy.
Treatment of acute hyperammonemic attacks and long-­term therapy are outlined earlier (see Table 105.6). Plasma concentration of
citrulline remains elevated at all times and may increase further after
administration of arginine. Patients can do well on a protein-­restricted
diet in conjunction with sodium benzoate, phenylbutyrate, and arginine therapy. Mild to moderate cognitive impairment is a common
sequela, even in a well-­treated patient.

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessive condition caused by biallelic
pathogenic variants in ASS1. The majority of patients are compound
heterozygotes for two different alleles. The prevalence of the condition
is 1 in 250,000 live births. The recent introduction of neonatal screening for urea cycle defects has shown that some affected patients are
ostensibly asymptomatic even on a regular diet. Long-­term follow-­up
is needed to be certain that these individuals do not sustain neurologic
sequelae.

Citrin Deficiency (Citrullinemia Type II)

Citrin (aspartate-­glutamate carrier protein) is a mitochondrial transporter encoded by SLC25A13. One of this protein’s functions is to
transport aspartate from mitochondria into cytoplasm and replenish the cytosolic aspartate pool required for converting citrulline to
argininosuccinic acid (see Fig. 105.13). If aspartate is unavailable to the
cytoplasmic component of the urea cycle, urea will not be formed at a
normal rate, and citrulline will accumulate. ASS activity is diminished
in the liver of these patients, but no pathogenic variant in the ASS1
gene has been found. It is postulated that citrin deficiency interferes
with translation of the messenger RNA for the ASS enzyme in the liver.
The condition initially was reported in Japan (regional prevalence ∼1
in 20,000), but many non-­Japanese patients have been since identified
(worldwide prevalence between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 230,000). Biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC25A13 have been associated with three
clinical forms of citrin deficiency.

Neonatal Intrahepatic Cholestasis (Citrullinemia
Type II, Neonatal Form)

Clinical and laboratory manifestations, which usually start before
the infant’s first birthday, include cholestatic jaundice with mild to
moderate direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, marked hypoproteinemia, and clotting dysfunction (increased prothrombin time and
partial thromboplastin time); increased serum γ-­glutamyltransferase
and alkaline phosphatase activities; and liver transaminases are usually normal. Plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline are
usually normal, but moderate elevations have been reported. There
may be increases in plasma concentrations of methionine, tyrosine,
alanine, and threonine. Elevated levels of serum galactose have been
found, even though the enzymes of galactose metabolism are normal.
The reason for hypergalactosemia is not clear. Marked elevation in the
serum level of α-­fetoprotein is also present. These findings resemble
those of tyrosinemia type I, but unlike the latter condition, urinary
excretion of succinylacetone is not elevated (see Chapter 105.2). Liver
biopsy shows fatty infiltration, cholestasis with dilated canaliculi, and
a moderate degree of fibrosis. The condition is usually self-­limiting,
and the majority of infants recover spontaneously by 1 year of age with
supportive and symptomatic treatment. Hepatic failure requiring liver
transplantation has occurred in a few cases. Although the condition
is commonly seen in Japan, the diagnosis should be considered in
any case of unexplained neonatal hepatitis with cholestasis. Data on
the long-­term prognosis and the natural history of the condition are
limited; development into the adult form of the condition after several
years of a seemingly asymptomatic hiatus has been observed.

Failure to Thrive and Dyslipidemia Due to Citrin
Deficiency

Some patients can present between 1 and 10 years of age with peculiar
dietary habits favoring high-­protein and high-­lipid foods. It is accompanied by poor appetite, hypoglycemic episodes, and failure to thrive.
Laboratory evaluation may reveal mild hyperammonemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated low-­density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and
low high-­density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. This presentation of citrin deficiency in children is often considered a prodromal
form of the adult form of citrullinemia type II.

Citrullinemia Type II, Adult Form (Adult-­Onset
Citrullinemia; Citrullinemia Type II, Mild Form)

Without prior molecular diagnosis or family history, individuals affected by this form of citrullinemia type II (CTLN2) are often

853

identified acutely. A previously healthy individual may present with
nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms such as disorientation, delirium, delusion, aberrant behavior, tremors, and psychosis. Moderate
degrees of hyperammonemia and hypercitrullinemia are present. The
age at onset is usually between 20 and 40 years but can happen at any
point after age 11 years. Patients who recover from the first episode
may have recurrent attacks. Pancreatitis, hyperlipidemia, and hepatoma are major complications among the survivors. Medical treatment
of CTLN2 has been mostly ineffective to prevent future attacks. A diet
enriched in protein and lipids helps restore cytosolic aspartate and
stimulate ureagenesis. In confirmed citrin deficiency, a low-­protein/
high-­carbohydrate diet should be avoided. Although liver transplantation appears to be effective in preventing future episodes of hyperammonemia, enteral supplementation with pyruvate, arginine, and
medium-­chain triglycerides can be tried first to help prevent hyperammonemic episodes and improve growth.

ARGININOSUCCINATE LYASE DEFICIENCY
(ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA)

The severity of the clinical and biochemical manifestations varies considerably (see Figs. 105.13 and 105.14). In the severe form of ASL deficiency, severe hyperammonemia (see earlier) can develop in the first
few days of life, and without treatment affected infants can perish. The
clinical course of ASL deficiency in patients who survive the initial acute
episode is often characterized by intellectual disability, failure to thrive,
hypertension, gallstones, liver fibrosis, and hepatomegaly. A common
finding in untreated patients is dry and brittle hair (trichorrhexis
nodosa), although this finding is relatively nonspecific. Acute attacks
of severe hyperammonemia may occur during a catabolic state triggered by infections, trauma, or dietary indiscretion. Laboratory findings include hyperammonemia, moderate elevations in liver enzymes,
nonspecific increases in plasma levels of glutamine and alanine, a moderate increase in plasma levels of citrulline (less than in citrullinemia),
and a marked increase in the concentration of argininosuccinic acid in
plasma, urine, and CSF. The CSF levels are usually higher than those in
plasma. The enzyme is present in erythrocytes, the liver, and cultured
fibroblasts. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by identification of biallelic
pathogenic variants in the ASL gene or, rarely, by measurement of the
enzyme activity in cultured amniotic cells. Argininosuccinic acid is
also elevated in the amniotic fluid of affected fetuses.
Treatment of acute hyperammonemic attacks and the long-­term
therapy of the condition are outlined earlier in this chapter. Intellectual disability, persistent hepatomegaly with mild increases in liver
enzymes, and bleeding tendencies as a result of abnormal clotting
factors are common sequelae. ASL deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of about 1 in 220,000 live births. Early
detection is achieved through mass screening of newborn infants.

ARGINASE 1 DEFICIENCY (HYPERARGININEMIA)

Arginase 1 deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition caused by
biallelic pathogenic variants in ARG1 (see Figs. 105.13 and 105.14).
Two genetically distinct arginases are present in humans. Arginase 1
(ARG1) is a cytosolic enzyme and is expressed in the liver and can be
found in erythrocytes. Arginase 2 (ARG2) is expressed in renal and
brain mitochondria. The role of ARG2 is not well understood; its activity in patients with argininemia appears to have no protective effect.
Clinical manifestations of arginase 1 deficiency are somewhat different from other urea cycle enzyme defects, although acute neonatal hyperammonemia presenting with intractable seizures, cerebral
edema, and death has also been reported. Outside of the neonatal
period, the onset of arginase 1 deficiency often is insidious. The infant
can remain asymptomatic in the first few months or years of life. A progressive spastic diplegia with scissoring of the lower extremities, choreoathetotic movements, loss of developmental milestones, and failure
to thrive in a previously normal infant may suggest the diagnosis. Some
children were treated for cerebral palsy before arginase 1 deficiency
was confirmed. Intellectual disability is progressive; seizures are common, but episodes of severe hyperammonemia are not as frequent as in
the more proximal urea cycle defects. Hepatomegaly may be present.

854 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Laboratory evaluation reveals marked elevations of arginine in
plasma and CSF (see Fig. 105.14). Urinary orotic acid can be increased.
Determination of amino acids in plasma is a critical step in the diagnosis of argininemia. Guanidino compounds (α-­keto-­guanidinovaleric
acid and α-­keto-­argininic acid) can be markedly increased in urine.
The diagnosis is secured by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ARG1 or, rarely, by assaying arginase activity in erythrocytes.
Treatment consists of a low-­protein diet at the age-­appropriate
RDA. The dietary composition and daily intake of protein should be
monitored by frequent plasma amino acid determinations. Supplementation with arginine in ARG1-­deficient patients is contraindicated.
Sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate is also effective in controlling hyperammonemia and lowering plasma arginine levels. Liver
transplantation has produced promising results, but experience with
long-­term outcome is limited. Early detection is feasible through mass
screening of newborn infants.

TRANSIENT HYPERAMMONEMIA OF THE
NEWBORN

The blood concentration of ammonia in a full-­term infant can be as
high as 100 μmol/L, or two to three times greater than that of the older
child or adult. Blood levels approach the adult normal values after
a few weeks of life (see Fig. 105.14). Plasma ammonia levels greater
than 100 μmol/L should prompt additional diagnostic steps to evaluate
for possible genetic causes of hyperammonemia. Infrequently, severe
transient hyperammonemia can be observed in infants whose diagnostic workup reveals no biochemical abnormalities implicating genes
encoding components of the urea cycle. The majority of affected infants
are premature and have mild respiratory distress syndrome. Hyperammonemic coma can develop within 2-­3 days of life, and the infant may
succumb to the disease if treatment is not started immediately. Laboratory studies reveal marked hyperammonemia (plasma ammonia
as high as 4,000 μmol/L) with moderate increases in plasma levels of
glutamine and alanine. Plasma concentrations of urea cycle intermediate amino acids are usually normal except for citrulline, which may
be moderately elevated. The cause of the disorder is unknown. Urea
cycle enzyme activities are normal. Treatment of hyperammonemia
should be initiated promptly and continued vigorously. Recovery without sequelae has been reported, and hyperammonemia does not recur
even with a normal-­protein diet.

DISORDERS OF ORNITHINE METABOLISM

Ornithine, a key intermediate of the urea cycle, is not incorporated into
natural proteins. Rather, it is generated in the cytosol from arginine and
must be transported into mitochondria, where it becomes a substrate
in reactions catalyzed by OTC forming citrulline. Excess ornithine is
catabolized by two enzymes: ornithine aminotransferase, a mitochondrial enzyme converting ornithine to a proline precursor, and ornithine
decarboxylase, which resides in the cytosol and converts ornithine
to putrescine (see Fig. 105.13). Two genetic disorders feature hyperornithinemia: gyrate atrophy of the retina and hyperammonemia-­
hyperornithinemia-­homocitrullinemia (HHH) syndrome.

Gyrate Atrophy of the Retina and Choroid

This rare, autosomal recessive disorder is caused by biallelic pathogenic
variants in OAT leading to the deficient activity of ornithine aminotransferase (see Fig. 105.13). Approximately 30% of the reported cases
are from Finland. Clinical manifestations may include hyperammonemia in the first months of life in some patients. Findings that define
the phenotype of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency include night
blindness, myopia, loss of peripheral vision, and posterior subcapsular
cataracts. These eye changes start between 5 and 10 years of age and
progress to complete blindness by the fourth decade of life. Atrophic
lesions in the retina resemble cerebral gyri. These patients usually have
normal intelligence. Besides the characteristic 10-­to 20-­fold increase
in plasma levels of ornithine (400-­1,400 μmol/L), plasma levels of

glutamate, glutamine, lysine, creatine, and creatinine can be moderately decreased. Some patients show partial improvement with high
doses of pyridoxine. An arginine-­restricted diet in conjunction with
supplemental lysine, proline, and creatine has been successful in reducing plasma ornithine concentration and has produced some clinical
improvement.

Hyperammonemia-­Hyperornithinemia-­
Homocitrullinemia Syndrome

Biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC25A15 result in an autosomal
recessive disorder, HHH syndrome. This defect of the ornithine
transport system leads to accumulation of ornithine in the cytosol
and a depletion of this amino acid in mitochondria. The former
causes hyperornithinemia, and the latter results in disruption of
the urea cycle and hyperammonemia (see Fig. 105.13). Homocitrulline is presumably formed through condensation of mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate with lysine. Clinical manifestations of
hyperammonemia can develop shortly after birth or may be delayed
until adulthood. Acute episodes of hyperammonemia manifest as
refusal to feed, vomiting, and lethargy; coma may occur during
infancy. Progressive neurologic signs, such as lower limb weakness, increased deep tendon reflexes, spasticity, clonus, seizures,
and varying degrees of psychomotor retardation may develop if
the condition remains undiagnosed. No ocular findings have been
observed in these patients. Laboratory findings reveal marked
increases in plasma levels of ornithine and homocitrulline in addition to hyperammonemia (see Fig. 105.14). Acute episodes of hyperammonemia should be treated promptly (see earlier). Restriction of
protein intake improves hyperammonemia. Oral supplementation
with arginine (or citrulline) has produced clinical improvement in
some patients.

CONGENITAL GLUTAMINE DEFICIENCY

Glutamine is synthesized endogenously from glutamate and ammonia by a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, glutamine synthetase (see
Fig. 105.11). Glutamine is known to be involved in several important
functions, including detoxification of ammonia. Deficiency of this
enzyme, resulting in glutamine deficiency, has been reported in three
infants from three unrelated families. All affected infants manifested
multiorgan involvement, including brain malformations (abnormal
gyrations, hypomyelination), facial abnormalities (broad nasal root,
low-­set ears), hypotonia, and seizures at birth. Two of the patients
died from multiorgan failure (respiratory and heart failure) in the
neonatal period. One child was alive at 3 years of age with severe
developmental delay. Glutamine was absent in plasma, urine, and
CSF, but plasma levels of glutamic acid were normal. Congenital
glutamine deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition caused by
biallelic pathogenic variants in GLUL.

105.13 Histidine
Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Histidine is degraded through the urocanic acid pathway to glutamic
acid. Several genetic biochemical aberrations involving the degradative
pathway of histidine have been reported, but the clinical significance of
elevated histidine levels has not been established.
Decarboxylation of histidine by histidine decarboxylase produces
histamine. Deficiency of this enzyme has been implicated in the familial form of Tourette syndrome (see Chapter 105.11).

855

Pyridox(am)ine 5′-­Phosphate Oxidase (PNPO)
Deficiency

Oleg A. Shchelochkov and Charles P. Venditti
Lysine is catabolized through two pathways. In the first pathway,
lysine is condensed with α-­ketoglutaric acid to form saccharopine. Saccharopine is then catabolized to α-­aminoadipic semialdehyde and glutamic acid. These first two steps are catalyzed by
α-­aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, which has two activities:
lysine-­
ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase
(Fig. 105.15). In the second pathway, lysine is first transaminated and
then condensed to its cyclic forms: pipecolic acid and piperideine-­
6-­carboxylic acid (P6C). P6C and its linear form, α-­aminoadipic
semialdehyde, are oxidized to α-­aminoadipic acid by the enzyme
antiquitin. This is the major pathway for d-­lysine in the body and
for l-­lysine in the brain.
Hyperlysinemia-­saccharopinuria, α-­aminoadipic, and α-­
ketoadipic acidemia are biochemical conditions caused by inborn
errors of lysine degradation. Individuals with these conditions are usually asymptomatic.

PYRIDOXINE–DEPENDENT EPILEPSY (PDE)

Pyridoxal 5′-­phosphate (P5P), the active form of pyridoxine (vitamin
B6), is the cofactor for many enzymes, including those involved in the
metabolism of neurotransmitters. Intracellular P5P deficiency in the
brain may result in a seizure disorder that is refractory to common
anticonvulsant agents but is responsive to high doses of pyridoxine.
These pyridoxine-­responsive phenotypes are seen in the following
genetic metabolic conditions.

Antiquitin (α-­Aminoadipic Semialdehyde
Dehydrogenase) Deficiency

This is the most common cause of PDE. A deficiency of antiquitin
(encoded by ALDH7A1) results in accumulation of P6C in brain tissue
(see Fig. 105.15). P6C reacts with P5P and renders it inactive. Large
doses of pyridoxine are therefore needed to overcome this inactivation.
The condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

PNPO deficiency clinically overlaps with antiquitin deficiency.
PNPO-­deficient patients often present with neonatal-­onset seizures,
developmental delays, spastic tetraplegia, and nonspecific findings
on brain imaging (delayed myelination, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal signals in the basal ganglia). Developmental regression, optic
disc pallor, and retinopathy have been reported infrequently. Plasma
and CSF amino acid analysis may reveal elevated glycine, prompting evaluation for NKH (see Chapter 105.7), leading to a delay in
initiating treatment with P5P. A CSF neurotransmitter assay revealed
inconsistent changes in the levels of 3-­O-­methyldopa, homovanillic
acid, and 5-­hydroxyindoleacetic acid. A normal CSF level of P5P was
reported in one patient, suggesting that a therapeutic trial with P5P
and molecular analysis may be a prudent strategy in some patients
irrespective of the CSF studies. The lowest effective dose of P5P
should be used to avoid toxicity. The disorder is caused by biallelic
pathogenic variants in PNPO.

Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency and Molybdenum
Cofactor Deficiency

In this rare condition (see Chapter 105.4), accumulation of sulfites
causes inhibition of enzymatic activity of antiquitin and accumulation of P6C, which in turn causes inactivation of P5P and vitamin B6
dependency.

Hyperprolinemia Type II

In this condition, accumulation of P5C in brain tissue can also cause
inactivation of P5P, leading to pyridoxine dependency (see Chapter
105.9 and Fig. 105.9).

Hypophosphatasia

P5P is the main circulating form of pyridoxine. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is required for dephosphorylation of P5P to generate
free pyridoxine, which is the only form of vitamin B6 that can cross
the BBB and enter the brain cells. Pyridoxine is rephosphorylated

856 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
intracellularly to form P5P. In the infantile form of hypophosphatasia, P5P cannot be dephosphorylated to free pyridoxine because
of the marked deficiency of tissue-­nonspecific ALP. This results in
deficiency of pyridoxine in the brain and PDE (see Chapters 611
and 724).
The main clinical manifestation of PDE caused by antiquitin
deficiency is generalized seizures, which usually occur in the first
days of life and are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsant
therapies. Some mothers of affected fetuses report abnormal intrauterine fluttering movements. The seizures are usually tonic-­clonic
in nature but can be almost any type. Other manifestations such
as dystonia, respiratory distress, and abdominal distention with
vomiting, hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia may be
present. Learning problems and speech delay are common sequelae.
Late-­onset forms of the condition (as late as 5 years of age) have
been reported. Consequently, a trial with vitamin B6 is recommended in any infant with intractable convulsions (see Chapters
611.04 and 611.06).
Laboratory findings show increased concentrations of α-­
aminoadipic semialdehyde and pipecolic acid in the CSF, plasma, and
urine. EEG abnormalities may normalize after treatment. Neuroimaging may be normal, but cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, periventricular hyperintensity, intracerebral hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus have
been reported.
Treatment with vitamin B6 (50-­100 mg/day) usually results in a dramatic improvement of both seizures and the EEG abnormalities. High
doses of pyridoxine can result in peripheral neuropathy, and doses
>500 mg/day should be avoided. The pyridoxine dependency, and thus
the therapy, are lifelong. The therapeutic benefit of a lysine-­restricted,
l-­arginine-­enriched diet is being evaluated.

Glutaric Aciduria Type 1 (Glutaryl-­CoA Dehydrogenase
Deficiency)

Glutaric acid is an intermediate in the degradation of lysine (see Fig.
105.15), hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. Glutaric aciduria type 1, a disorder caused by a deficiency of glutaryl-­CoA dehydrogenase, should
be differentiated from glutaric aciduria type 2, a distinct clinical and
biochemical disorder caused by defects in the mitochondrial electron
transport chain (see Chapter 106.1).
Glutaric aciduria type 1 is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by
biallelic loss-­of-­function variants in GCDH. Its prevalence is estimated
at 1 in 100,000 live births worldwide. The condition is more prevalent
in some ethnic populations (e.g., Canadian Oji-­Cree Indians, Irish
Travelers, Black South Africans, Swedes, and the Old Order Amish
population in the United States). A high prevalence of known pathogenic variants in specific ethnic populations can enable a cost-­effective
molecular evaluation and counseling. Prenatal diagnosis can be
accomplished by demonstrating increased concentrations of glutaric
acid in amniotic fluid, by assay of the enzyme activity in amniocytes or
chorionic villus samples, or by identification of the known pathogenic
variants in GCDH.

Clinical Manifestations

Macrocephaly is a common, but nonspecific, finding in patients
with glutaric aciduria type 1. It develops in the first year of life
but can also be present at birth and precede the onset of neurologic manifestations. Some affected infants may also show subtle
neurologic symptoms, such as delayed onset of motor milestones,
irritability, and feeding problems, during this seemingly asymptomatic period. The onset of the condition is usually heralded by acute
encephalopathic findings, such as loss of normal developmental
milestones (head control, rolling over, or sitting), seizures, generalized rigidity, opisthotonos, choreoathetosis, and dystonia caused
by acute striatal injury. These symptoms may occur suddenly in
an apparently normal infant after a minor infection. Brain imaging reveals increased extraaxial (particularly frontal) fluid with

stretched bridging veins, striatal lesions, dilated lateral ventricles,
cortical atrophy (mainly in the frontotemporal region), and fibrosis. Recovery from the first attack usually occurs slowly, and some
residual neurologic abnormalities may persist, especially dystonia
and choreoathetosis. Without treatment, additional acute attacks
resembling the first can occur during subsequent episodes of intercurrent infections or catabolic states. In some patients, these signs
and symptoms may develop gradually in the first few years of life.
Hypotonia and choreoathetosis may gradually progress into rigidity and dystonia (insidious form). Acute episodes of metabolic
decompensation with vomiting, ketosis, seizures, and coma also
occur in this form after infection or other catabolic states. Without
treatment, death may occur in the first decade of life during one of
these episodes. Affected infants are prone to development of subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhage after minor falls and head
traumas. This can be misdiagnosed as child abuse. The intellectual
abilities usually remain relatively normal in most patients.

Laboratory Findings

During acute episodes, mild to moderate metabolic acidosis and
ketosis may occur. Hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and elevations of serum transaminases are seen in some patients. High concentrations of glutaric acid are usually found in the urine, blood,
and CSF. 3-­Hydroxyglutaric acid may also be present in the body
fluids. The acylcarnitine profile shows elevated glutarylcarnitine
(C5DC) in blood and urine. Plasma concentrations of amino acids
are usually within normal limits. Laboratory findings may be unremarkable between attacks. Glutaric aciduria type 1 can be identified
on the newborn screen by measuring glutarylcarnitine (C5DC) levels in blood spots. The sensitivity of this screening method depends
on the cutoff value used by a newborn screen program, and some
patients may not be detected. For example, a subset of patients with
glutaric aciduria type 1 can present with normal plasma and urinary
levels of glutaric acid and variably elevated plasma glutarylcarnitine.
This type of glutaric aciduria type 1, referred to as a “low-­excretor”
phenotype, carries the same risk of developing brain injury as in a
“high-­excretor” phenotype. In some low-­excreting patients, glutaric
acid is elevated only in the CSF. Urinary glutarylcarnitine appears
to be a more sensitive screening method to identify affected low-­
excreting patients. Molecular analysis of GCDH can aid in identifying patients with a low-­excretor phenotype associated with specific
pathogenic variants (e.g., p.M405V, p.V400M, p.R227P). We recommend performing molecular analysis of GCDH or glutaryl-­C oA
dehydrogenase enzyme activity in any child presenting with unexplained progressive dystonia and dyskinesia.

Treatment

Patients require a lysine-­and tryptophan-­
restricted diet while
meeting physiologic requirements for protein, micronutrients, and
vitamins. Increased dietary arginine may decrease cellular uptake
of lysine and decrease the endogenous formation of glutaryl-­C oA.
Patients should be routinely evaluated for lysine and tryptophan deficiency by monitoring plasma amino acids and growth. l-­Carnitine
supplementation (50-­100 mg/kg/day orally) is recommended in all
cases. Emergency treatment during acute illness, including temporary cessation of protein intake for 24 hours, replacement of lost
calories using carbohydrates or lipids, IV l-­carnitine, IV dextrose,
prompt treatment of infection, and control of fever is critical to
decreasing the risk of striatal injury. All patients should be provided with an emergency letter describing the underlying diagnosis,
recommended evaluation, and treatment. Early diagnosis through
newborn screening with prevention and aggressive treatment of
intercurrent catabolic states (infections) can help minimize striatal
injury and ensure a more favorable prognosis. Patients with movement disorder and spasticity may require treatment with baclofen,
diazepam, trihexyphenidyl, and injectable botulinum toxin A.

Chapter 105 u Defects in Metabolism of Amino Acids
LYSINURIC PROTEIN INTOLERANCE (LPI)

This rare autosomal recessive disorder is caused by pathogenic variants in SLC7A7 leading to impaired function of a protein transporting the cationic amino acids lysine, ornithine, and arginine in the
intestine and kidneys. A deficiency of the transporter protein (Y+L
amino acid transporter 1) in this condition causes multisystem
manifestations, which often start with gastrointestinal symptoms.
The transport defect in this condition resides in the basolateral
(antiluminal) membrane of enterocytes and renal tubular epithelia.
This explains the observation that cationic amino acids are unable
to cross these cells even when administered as dipeptides. Lysine in
the form of dipeptide crosses the luminal membrane of the enterocytes but hydrolyzes to free lysine in the cytoplasm. Free lysine,
unable to cross the basolateral membrane of the cells, can diffuse
back into the lumen leading to gastrointestinal symptoms.
Refusal to feed, nausea, aversion to protein, vomiting, and mild
diarrhea, which may result in failure to thrive, wasting, and hypotonia, can be seen shortly after birth. Breastfed infants usually
remain asymptomatic until soon after weaning, possibly because of
the switch to a higher-­protein solid foods. Episodes of hyperammonemia caused by the depletion of ornithine and arginine in the
urea cycle may occur after ingestion of a high-­protein meal. Mild
to moderate hepatosplenomegaly, osteoporosis, sparse brittle hair,
thin extremities with moderate centripetal adiposity, and growth
retardation are common physical findings in patients whose condition has remained undiagnosed. Neurocognitive status is usually
normal, but moderate intellectual disability has been observed in
some patients.
Progressive interstitial pneumonitis with bouts of acute exacerbation often occurs and often progresses to severe alveolar proteinosis.
Clinical manifestations include progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue,
cough, diminished breath sound, and inspiratory rales; cyanosis may
develop in older patients. Some LPI patients have remained undiagnosed until the appearance of pulmonary manifestations. Radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis has been observed in up to 65%
of patients without clinical manifestations of pulmonary involvement.
Renal involvement is manifested initially by proteinuria, hematuria,
and elevation of serum creatinine, which may progress to end-­stage
renal failure. Renal tubular involvement with laboratory findings of
renal Fanconi syndrome may also be present. Renal biopsy reveals
pathologic findings consistent with glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Hematologic findings of anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated ferritin may also be present.
Other organs are frequently involved. A condition resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome
has been reported. Immunologic abnormalities (impaired lymphocyte
function, abnormalities in immune globulins, hypocomplementemia)
and acute pancreatitis are frequent features of LPI.
Pregnancies in affected mothers have been complicated by anemia, thrombocytopenia, toxemia, and bleeding, but offspring appear
healthy at birth.
Laboratory findings may reveal hyperammonemia and an elevated
concentration of urinary orotic acid, which develop after high-­protein
feeding. Plasma concentrations of lysine, arginine, and ornithine are usually mildly decreased, but urinary levels of these amino acids, especially
lysine, are greatly increased. The pathogenesis of hyperammonemia is
likely related to the depletion of urea cycle intermediates caused by poor
absorption and the increased renal loss of ornithine and arginine. Plasma
concentrations of alanine, glutamine, serine, glycine, and proline are usually increased. Anemia, increased serum levels of ferritin, LDH, thyroxine-­
binding globulin, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia are
common findings often leading to the workup for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This condition should be differentiated from hyperammonemia caused by urea cycle defects (see Chapter 105.12), especially in
heterozygous females with OTC deficiency, in whom increased urinary
excretion of lysine, ornithine, and arginine is not seen.

857

Treatment with a low-­protein diet providing the RDA of protein and supplemented with oral citrulline (50-­100 mg/kg/day)
can produce biochemical and clinical improvements. Episodes of
hyperammonemia should be treated promptly (see Chapter 105.12).
Supplementation with lysine (10-­30 mg/kg/day) given in small and
frequent doses helps improve plasma levels. The dose of lysine
should be titrated down if patients develop abdominal pain and
diarrhea. Treatment with high doses of prednisone has been effective in the management of acute pulmonary complications in some
patients. Bronchopulmonary lavage is the treatment of choice for
patients with alveolar proteinosis. The condition is more prevalent
in Finland and Japan, where the prevalence is 1 in 60,000 and 1 in
57,000 live births, respectively.

105.15 N-­Acetylaspartic Acid (Canavan
Disease)
 

Reuben K. Matalon† and Dena R. Matalon
N-­Acetylaspartic acid (NAA), a derivative of aspartic acid, is synthesized in the brain and is found in a high concentration similar
to glutamic acid. NAA has multiple functions, such as serving as an
acetate reservoir for myelin synthesis, as well as being an organic
osmolyte that helps regulate cerebral osmolality. However, the complete function of NAA is not yet fully understood. Aspartoacylase (ASPA) cleaves the N-­acetyl group from NAA. A deficiency of
aspartoacylase leads to Canavan disease, a severe leukodystrophy
characterized by excessive excretion of NAA and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive disorder and is more prevalent in individuals of
Ashkenazi Jewish descent than in other ethnic groups. The defective gene for Canavan disease (ASPA) can be tested in patients, family members, and at-­risk populations.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY

Deficiency of the enzyme aspartoacylase due to pathogenic variants in
the ASPA gene leads to NAA accumulation in the brain, especially in
the white matter, and massive urinary excretion. Excessive amounts of
NAA are also present in the blood and CSF. Brain biopsies of patients
with Canavan disease show spongy degeneration of the myelin fibers,
astrocytic swelling, and elongated mitochondria. There is striking vacuolization and astrocytic swelling in the white matter. Electron microscopy reveals distorted mitochondria. As the disease progresses, the
ventricles enlarge because of cerebral atrophy.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

The severity of Canavan disease covers a wide spectrum. Infants
usually appear normal at birth and may not manifest symptoms of
the disease until 3-­6 months of age, when they develop progressive
macrocephaly, severe hypotonia, persistent head lag, and delayed
milestones. As the disease progresses, there is spasticity, joint stiffness, and contractures. Optic atrophy and seizures subsequently
develop. Feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and gastroesophageal reflux may occur in the first year of life followed by swallowing
deterioration that may require nasogastric feeding or permanent
gastrostomy. In the past, most individuals died in the first decade
of life, but with the advances in medical technology and improved
supportive care, survival now extends to the second or third decade.

disease. Extensive thickening of the white matter radiation is seen.

ATYPICAL CANAVAN DISEASE

Juvenile or mild Canavan disease is less common than infantile Canavan disease and is most prevalent in non-­Ashkenazi Jews. Affected
individuals with juvenile Canavan disease usually present with mild
speech and motor delay and may have retinitis pigmentosa. The other
typical features of Canavan disease are usually not present. These children have moderately increased urinary excretion of NAA to suggest
Canavan disease. Brain MRI demonstrates increased signal intensity in
the basal ganglia rather than global white matter disease, sometimes
leading to confusion with mitochondrial disease.

DIAGNOSIS

In a typical individual with Canavan disease, brain MRI shows diffuse
white matter degeneration, primarily in the cerebral hemispheres,
with less involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem (Fig. 105.16).
Repeated evaluations may be required. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be done to show the high peak of NAA, which
strongly suggests Canavan disease. The diagnosis can also be established by finding elevated amounts of NAA in the urine or blood.
NAA is found in only trace amounts (24 ± 16 μmol/mmol creatinine)
in the urine of unaffected individuals, whereas its concentration is in
the range of 1,440 ± 873 μmol/mmol creatinine in individuals with
Canavan disease. High levels of NAA can also be detected in plasma,
CSF, and brain tissue. Aspartoacylase enzyme analysis from fibroblasts is often used to confirm the diagnosis but is not necessary. The
activity of aspartoacylase in the fibroblasts of obligate carriers is half
or less the activity found in normal individuals. Molecular analysis

for variants in the ASPA gene is now recommended for all individuals
in which Canavan disease is suspected.
The differential diagnosis of Canavan disease should include Alexander disease, another leukodystrophy associated with macrocephaly.
Alexander disease is caused by a defect in the synthesis of glial fibrillary
acidic protein, and the diagnosis can be ruled out by genetic testing of
variants in the GFAP gene.
There are two predominant pathogenic variants leading to Canavan disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The first is an
amino acid substitution (p.Glu285Ala) in which glutamic acid is
substituted for alanine. This pathogenic variant is the most frequent
and encompasses 83% of mutant alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with Canavan disease. The second most common pathogenic variant is a change from tyrosine to a nonsense pathogenic
variant, leading to a stop in the coding sequence (p.Tyr231*). This
accounts for 13% of mutant Ashkenazi alleles. In the non-­Jewish
population, more diverse pathogenic variants have been observed,
with the two variants common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population
being rare. A different variant (p.Ala305Glu), the substitution of
alanine for glutamic acid, accounts for 40% of mutant alleles in
non-­Jewish individuals. Over 70 pathogenic variants have been
reported in the non-­Jewish population. With Canavan disease, it
is important to obtain a molecular diagnosis because this will lead
to accurate counseling and prenatal guidance for the family. If the
specific variants are not known, prenatal diagnosis relies on the
NAA level in the amniotic fluid. In Ashkenazi Jewish individuals,
the carrier frequency may be as high as 1:40, nearing that of Tay-­
Sachs disease. Carrier screening for Canavan disease is available.
Genotype-­
phenotype studies and aspartoacylase expression and
enzymatic activity help to prognosticate the severity of disease.
Patients with juvenile or mild forms of Canavan disease have been
compound heterozygotes with a mild pathogenic variant on one
allele and a severe variant on the other allele. Mild variants include
p.Tyr288Cys and p.Arg71His.

TREATMENT AND PREVENTION

Treatment for Canavan disease is supportive. After diagnosis, individuals should be monitored closely in terms of feeding and nutritional
status, development, and risk for seizures. Medical intervention may
be necessary such as antiepileptics, acetazolamide for increased intracranial pressures, and botulinum toxin injections for spasticity. Individuals benefit from early therapy interventions and special education
programs to maximize developmental potential and communication.
Genetic counseling, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis are the only
current methods of prevention.
Studies of gene therapy using recombinant adeno-­
associated
viruses (rAAVs) have shown some positive results in knockout mice
models. Gene therapy attempts in children with Canavan disease
have shown a lack of adverse events, some decrease in the brain
elevation of N-­acetylaspartic acid, improved seizure frequency, and
slowing of the progression of brain atrophy. However, there was
no improvement in long-­term clinical status. Novel rAAV serotypes have been shown to better cross the blood-­brain barrier
and improved longevity of Canavan disease knockout mice, giving
promise for further use of gene therapy in individuals with Canavan
disease. Enzyme-­replacement therapy with ASPA and pegylated
ASPA is being studied in mice and has shown a decrease of NAA
in the brain.

Chapter 106 u Defects in Metabolism of Lipids

Chapter 106

Defects in Metabolism of
Lipids
106.1 Disorders of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid
β-­Oxidation
Jerry Vockley

Mitochondrial β-­
oxidation of fatty acids is an essential energy-­
producing pathway. It is particularly important during prolonged
periods of reduced caloric intake such as fasting or gastrointestinal illness or increased energy expenditure during physiologic stress such as
febrile illness. Under these conditions, the body switches from using
predominantly carbohydrate to predominantly fat as its major fuel.
Fatty acids are also important fuels for exercising skeletal muscle and
are the preferred substrate for normal cardiac metabolism. In these tissues, fatty acids are completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.
The end products of hepatic fatty acid oxidation are the ketone bodies 3-­hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. These compounds cannot be
oxidized by the liver but are exported to serve as important fuels in
peripheral tissues, particularly the brain, where ketone bodies can partially substitute for glucose during periods of fasting.
Genetic defects have been identified in almost all the known steps in
the fatty acid oxidation pathway; all are recessively inherited (Table 106.1).
Clinical manifestations characteristically involve tissues with a high
β-­oxidation flux, including liver, skeletal, and cardiac muscle, and are
age dependent. The most common early presentation is an acute episode of life-­threatening coma, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypoglycemia with or without hyperammonemia induced by a period of fasting
or illness in the first 2-­4 years of life. After about age 6 years, muscle
symptoms predominate in the disorders of long-­chain fatty acid oxidation, including myopathy, fatiguability, and recurrent rhabdomyolysis.
The latter is often brought on by excess activity or exercise. Cardiomyopathy can occur at any age in individuals with long-­chain defects
and may be exacerbated with acute episodes of illness. Patients with
fatty acid oxidation defects are often asymptomatic when well. Acutely
presenting disease may be misdiagnosed as Reye syndrome or, if fatal,
as sudden unexpected infant death. In some circumstances, clinical
manifestations appear to arise from toxic effects of fatty acid metabolites rather than inadequate energy production. These circumstances
include certain long chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (deficiencies
of long chain 3-­hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase [LCHAD], carnitine palmitoyltransferase-­IA [CPT-­IA], or mitochondrial trifunctional protein
[MTP; also known as TFP]) in which the presence of a homozygous
affected fetus increases the risk of a life-­threatening illness in the heterozygote mother, resulting in acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP)
or preeclampsia with HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes,
low platelets) syndrome. The mechanism of these obstetric complications is likely accumulation of toxic intermediates. Malformations of
the brain and kidneys have been described in severe deficiencies of
electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), ETF dehydrogenase (ETF-­DH),
and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-­II (CPT-­II), which might reflect in
utero toxicity of fatty acid metabolites or a developmental role for these
enzymes. Progressive retinal degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, and
chronic progressive liver disease have been identified in LCHAD and
MTP deficiency.
Fatty acid oxidation disorders are easily overlooked because the
only specific clue to the diagnosis may be the finding of inappropriately low concentrations of plasma or urinary ketones in an infant who
has hypoglycemia unless specialized metabolic testing is performed.
Genetic defects in ketone body utilization may also be overlooked
because ketonemia is an expected finding with fasting hypoglycemia.

859

Newborn screening programs using tandem mass spectrometry detect
characteristic plasma acylcarnitine profiles in most of these disorders,
allowing early and presymptomatic diagnosis. Screening programs
have demonstrated that all the fatty acid oxidation disorders combined
are among the most common inborn errors of metabolism, at least in
predominantly White populations.
Figures 106.1 and 106.2 outline the steps involved in the oxidation
of a typical long chain fatty acid. In the carnitine cycle, long chain fatty
acids are transported across the barrier of the inner mitochondrial
membrane as acylcarnitine esters. Medium-­chain fatty acids, which are
commonly provided as medium-­chain triglyceride supplementation
in infants who are failing to thrive, can bypass the carnitine cycle and
enter the mitochondrial β-­oxidation cycle directly. Within the mitochondria, successive rounds of the four-­step β-­oxidation cycle convert
the coenzyme A (CoA)–activated fatty acids to acetyl-­CoA units. Two
or three different chain-­length-­specific isoenzymes are needed for each
of these β-­oxidation steps to accommodate the different chain-­length
fatty acyl-­CoA species. The electrons generated in the first β-­oxidation
step (acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase) are carried by the electron transfer
pathway to the electron transport chain at the level of coenzyme Q for
adenosine triphosphate production, whereas electrons generated from
the third step (3-­hydroxyacyl-­CoA dehydrogenase) enter the electron
transport chain at the level of complex 1. Most of the acetyl-­CoA generated from fatty acid β-­oxidation in the liver flows through the pathway
of ketogenesis to form 3-­hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, whereas in
muscle and heart, the fatty acids are completely oxidized to CO2 and
water through oxidative phosphorylation. It has been demonstrated
that the enzymes of fatty acid oxidation physically and functionally
interact with each other and those of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

DEFECTS IN THE β-­OXIDATION CYCLE
Medium-­Chain Acyl-­CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency

Medium-­chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is the
most common fatty acid oxidation disorder. The disorder shows a
strong founder effect; most patients have a northwestern European
ancestry, and the majority of these patients have at least one copy of
a common MCAD missense pathogenic variant, an A-­G transition at
cDNA position 985 (c.985A>G) that changes a lysine to glutamic acid
at residue 329 (p.Lys329Glu).

Clinical Manifestations

Previously undiagnosed affected patients usually present in the first
3 months to 5 years of life with episodes of acute illness triggered by
prolonged fasting (>12-­16 hours). Signs and symptoms include vomiting and lethargy, which rapidly progress to coma or seizures and cardiorespiratory collapse. Sudden unexpected infant death may occur.
The liver may be slightly enlarged with fat deposition. Episodes are
rare until the infant is beyond the first few months of life, presumably
because of more frequent feedings at a younger age. Affected older
infants are at higher risk of symptoms as they begin to fast through the
night or are exposed to fasting stress during an intercurrent childhood
illness. Presentation in the first days of life with neonatal hypoglycemia
has been reported in newborns who were fasted inadvertently or were
being breastfed exclusively and thus are at higher risk because of early
reduced caloric intake. A diagnosis of MCAD has occasionally been
documented in previously healthy teenage and adult individuals, indicating that even patients who have been asymptomatic in infancy are
still at risk for metabolic decompensation if exposed to sufficient periods
of fasting. An unknown number of patients may remain asymptomatic.
Prior to routine newborn screening testing, as many as 25% of MCAD-­
deficient patients died or suffered severe brain injury from their first episode. Most patients are diagnosed in the newborn period by blood spot
acylcarnitine screening (part of newborn screening), allowing the initiation of early intervention and prevention of most signs and symptoms.

Laboratory Findings

During acute episodes, hypoglycemia is usually present. Plasma and
urinary ketone concentrations are inappropriately low (hypoketotic

Fig. 106.1 Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Carnitine enters the cell through the action of the organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN2).

Palmitate, a typical 16-­carbon long chain (LC) fatty acid, is transported across the plasma membrane and can be activated to form an LC fatty
acyl coenzyme A (CoA). It then enters into the carnitine cycle, where it is transesterified by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-­I (CPT-­I), translocated
across the inner mitochondrial membrane by carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (TRANS), and then reconverted into an LC fatty acyl-­CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-­II (CPT-­II) to undergo β-­oxidation. Very LC acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD/LCAD) leads to the production of (C16-­C10)
2,3-­enoyl CoA. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) contains the activities of enoyl CoA hydratase (hydratase), 3-­OH-­hydroxyacyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (3-­OH-­ACD), and β-­ketothiolase (thiolase). Acetyl-­CoA, a reduced form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH), and a reduced form of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are produced. Medium-­and short chain fatty acids (C8-­4) can enter the mitochondrial matrix independent of the carnitine cycle. Medium-­chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), short chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD), and short chain hydroxy
acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) are required. Acetyl-­CoA can then enter the Krebs (TCA) cycle. Electrons are transported from FADH to the respiratory chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-­DH). NADH enters the electron
transport chain through complex I. In the liver, acetyl-­CoA can be converted into hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA by β-­hydroxy-­β-­methylglutaryl-­
CoA synthase (HMG CoA synthase) and then the ketone body acetoacetate by the action of β-­hydroxy-­β-­methylglutaryl-­CoA lyase (HMG-­CoA lyase).

Acute illnesses should be promptly treated with intravenous (IV) fluids containing 10% dextrose to correct or prevent hypoglycemia and
to suppress lipolysis as rapidly as possible (see Chapter 113). Chronic
therapy consists of avoiding fasting. This usually requires simply
adjusting the diet to ensure that overnight fasting periods are limited
to <6 hours in infants under 6 months of age, <8 hours for infants 6-­24
months of age, and <12 hours for older children. Restricting dietary
fat or treatment with carnitine is unnecessary. There is likely no need
for active therapeutic intervention for individuals with the Thr199Cys
variant.

acids) that derive from microsomal and peroxisomal omega oxidation of accumulated medium-­chain fatty acids. Plasma and tissue concentrations of total carnitine are reduced to 25–50% of normal, and
the fraction of total esterified carnitine is increased. This pattern of
secondary carnitine deficiency is seen in most fatty acid oxidation
defects and reflects competition between increased acylcarnitine levels
and free carnitine for transport at the renal tubular plasma membrane.
Significant exceptions to this rule are the plasma membrane carnitine
transporter, CPT-­IA, and β-­hydroxy-­β-­methylglutaryl-­CoA (HMG-­
CoA) synthase deficiencies, which do not manifest secondary carnitine
deficiency.
Diagnostic metabolite patterns for MCAD deficiency include
increased plasma C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, and C10:1 acylcarnitine species and
increased urinary acylglycines, including hexanoylglycine, suberylglycine, and 3-­phenylpropionylglycine. Newborn screening, performed in
all states in the United States and in many other countries, can detect
presymptomatic MCAD deficiency based on these abnormal acylcarnitines in filter paper blood spots. The diagnosis can be confirmed by
demonstrating the common Ala985Gly pathogenic variant or sequencing the MCAD gene. A second common variant, Thr199Cys, has been
detected in infants identified by newborn screening. Interestingly, this
allele has not been seen to date in symptomatic MCAD patients, likely
because of the significant residual activity of this milder pathogenic
variant.

hypoglycemia). Because of the hypoketonemia, there is little or no
metabolic acidosis, which is typically present in children with hypoglycemia not caused by fatty acid oxidation disorders. Liver function tests
(LFTs) are abnormal, with elevations of liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase), elevated blood ammonia, and prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times. Liver biopsy at
times of acute illness shows microvesicular or macrovesicular steatosis
from triglyceride accumulation. During fasting stress or acute illness,
urinary organic acid profiles by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry show inappropriately low concentrations of ketones and elevated
levels of medium-­chain dicarboxylic acids (adipic, suberic, and sebacic

Up to 25% of previously undiagnosed patients may die during their
first attack of illness. There is often a history of a previous sibling
death that is presumed to be from an unrecognized MCAD deficiency.
Some patients may sustain permanent brain injury during an attack
of profound hypoglycemia. For survivors without brain damage and
essentially all babies identified by newborn screening, the prognosis is
excellent because progressive cognitive impairment or cardiomyopathy
does not occur in MCAD deficiency. Fasting tolerance improves with
age, and the risk of decompensation decreases. Because as many as 35%
of affected patients have never had an episode, testing of siblings of
affected patients is important to detect asymptomatic family members
who did not receive newborn screening.

Very Long Chain Acyl-­CoA Dehydrogenase
Deficiency

Very long chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is the
second most common diagnosed disorder of fatty acid oxidation. It was
originally termed “long chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase deficiency”
before the existence of the inner mitochondrial membrane-­bound
VLCAD was known. All patients previously diagnosed as having long
chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase deficiency have VLCAD gene defects.
Patients with VLCAD deficiency have no ability to oxidize physiologic
long chain fatty acids and are usually more severely affected than those
with MCAD deficiency, who have a milder oxidative defect. VLCAD
deficiency presents earlier in infancy and has more chronic problems
with muscle weakness or episodes of muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis.
Cardiomyopathy may be present during acute attacks provoked by fasting. The left ventricle may be hypertrophic or dilated and may show
poor contractility on echocardiography. Sudden unexpected death
has occurred in several patients, but most who survive the initial episode show improvement, including normalization of cardiac function.

Chapter 106 u Defects in Metabolism of Lipids
Other physical and routine laboratory features are similar to those of
MCAD deficiency, including secondary carnitine deficiency. The urinary organic acid profile shows a nonketotic dicarboxylic aciduria
with increased levels of C6-­12 dicarboxylic acids. Diagnosis may be suggested by an abnormal acylcarnitine profile with plasma or blood spot
C14:0, 14:1, 14:2 acylcarnitine species. However, the specific diagnosis
requires pathogenic variant analysis of the VLCAD gene. Newborn
screening by tandem mass spectrometry of dried blood spots is effective in identifying early/severe disease, though it can miss milder,
later-­onset cases. A common mild variant is identified by a newborn
screen that typically predicts later-­onset disease. Treatment has traditionally been based primarily on avoidance of fasting for >8-­12 hours
depending on age, along with supplementation with medium-­chain
triglycerides. Triheptanoin (Dojolvi) has been approved as a treatment
for VLCAD deficiency and for all other disorders of long-­chain fatty
acid oxidation. The odd-­chain fat heptanoate (C7) released from this
triglycerol provides acetyl-­CoA for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and
propionyl-­CoA, which is metabolized through methylmalonyl-­CoA to
succinyl-­CoA and succinate. This anaplerotic effect essentially eliminates hypoglycemia in long-­chain fatty acid oxidation disorder patients
and significantly improves heart function in patients with cardiomyopathy. However, although heptanoin does reduce the incidence, rhabdomyolysis remains a major problem in treated patients. This finding
led to the recognition of previously unrecognized inflammation as a
component of these disorders, likely caused by the accumulation of
a high level of proinflammatory long-­chain complex lipids. Patients
can develop a secondary carnitine deficiency; however, the need for
replacement therapy remains unclear. If the free carnitine level in
blood is <10 μM, supplementation with 25-­50 mg/kg of oral carnitine
(with a maximum of 1,000 mg/day) may be helpful, especially in the
face of cardiomyopathy or significant muscular symptoms.

Short Chain Acyl-­CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency

A small number of patients with two null pathogenic variants in
the short chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) gene have been
described with a variable phenotype. Most individuals classified as
being SCAD deficient actually have polymorphic DNA changes in the
SCAD gene; two common polymorphisms are Gly185Ser and Arg147Trp, present in biallelic fashion in 7% of the population. Although
SCAD deficiency was originally reported with a wide range of symptoms, it was likely a result of the frequency of the common polymorphisms in unrelated disease rather than a true causal relationship.
Long-­term follow-­up of infants identified by newborn screening
has failed to demonstrate a convincing, consistent phenotype, and
thus SCAD deficiency is best described as a biochemical phenotype
rather than a disease. The diagnosis is indicated by elevated levels of
butyrylcarnitine (C4-­carnitine) on newborn blood spots or plasma
and increased excretion of urinary ethylmalonic acid and butyrylglycine. These metabolic abnormalities are most pronounced in patients
with null pathogenic variants and are variably present in patients who
are homozygous for the common polymorphisms. In the context of
metabolic abnormalities consistent with SCAD deficiency in patients
with significant clinical problems, a thorough evaluation for another
unrelated diagnosis is indicated. There is no need for treatment of
individuals with SCAD deficiency.

Long Chain 3-­Hydroxyacyl-­CoA Dehydrogenase/
Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein Deficiency

The LCHAD enzyme is part of the MTP, which also contains two other
steps in β-­oxidation: long chain 2,3-­enoyl CoA hydratase and long chain
β-­ketothiolase. MTP is a heterotetrameric protein composed of two α
and two β chains derived from distinct contiguous genes, HADHA and
HADHB, that share a common promoter. In some patients, only the
LCHAD activity of the MTP is affected (LCHAD deficiency), whereas
others have deficiencies of all three activities (MTP deficiency).
Clinical manifestations include attacks of acute hypoketotic hypoglycemia similar to VLCAD deficiency; however, patients often show
evidence of more severe disease, including cardiomyopathy, muscle
cramps and weakness, and abnormal liver function (cholestasis).

863

Pigmented retinopathy leading to blindness, progressive liver failure,
peripheral neuropathy, and rhabdomyolysis are also present, with
retinopathy being more severe in isolated LCHAD deficiency and
neuropathy worse in combined MTP defects. Life-­threatening obstetric complications (AFLP, HELLP syndrome) have been observed in
heterozygous mothers carrying homozygous fetuses affected with
LCHAD/MTP deficiency. Sudden unexpected infant death may occur,
especially in populations where tandem mass spectrometry newborn
screening is not routine. The diagnosis is indicated by elevated levels of
blood spot or plasma 3-­hydroxy acylcarnitines of chain lengths C16-­C18.
The urinary organic acid profile in patients may show increased levels
of 3-­hydroxydicarboxylic acids of chain lengths C6-­C14. Secondary carnitine deficiency is common. A common pathogenic variant in the α
subunit, E474Q, is seen in more than 60% of isolated LCHAD-­deficient
patients. This pathogenic variant in the fetus is especially associated
with the obstetric complications, but other pathogenic variants in
either subunit may also be linked to maternal illness.
Treatment is similar to that for VLCAD deficiency; that is, avoiding
fasting stress, triheptanoin, and potentially carnitine. Docosahexaenoic acid may slow the retinal changes but does not prevent them.
None of these therapeutic measures likely affect the development or
progression of peripheral neuropathy. Liver transplantation has been
attempted in patients with severe liver failure but does not ameliorate the metabolic abnormalities or prevent the myopathic or retinal
complications.

Short Chain 3-­Hydroxyacyl-­CoA Dehydrogenase
Deficiency

Very few patients with proven pathogenic variants of short chain
3-­hydroxyacyl-­CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) have been reported.
Most cases with recessive pathogenic variants of the SCHAD gene
have presented with episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia that was
caused by hyperinsulinism. In contrast to those with other forms of
fatty acid oxidation disorders, these patients required specific therapy with diazoxide for hyperinsulinism to avoid recurrent hypoglycemia. A single patient with compound heterozygous pathogenic
variants presented with fulminant hepatic failure at age 10 months.
The SCHAD protein has a nonenzymatic function in which it directly
interacts with glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) to inhibit its activity.
In the absence of SCHAD protein, this inhibition is removed, leading to upregulation of GDH enzyme activity, a recognized cause of
hyperinsulinism, usually from activating pathogenic variants of the
GDH gene. Severe deficiency of SCHAD protein often presents predominantly as protein-­sensitive hypoglycemia rather than as fasting
hypoglycemia. It appears that if SCHAD protein is present, inhibition of GDH is maintained even when there is no SCHAD enzyme
activity; these patients may present with a more traditional fatty
acid oxidation defect. Specific metabolic markers for SCHAD deficiency include elevated plasma C4-­hydroxy acylcarnitine and urine
3-­hydroxyglutaric acid. Successful newborn screening for SCHAD
deficiency has been recorded, but the sensitivity of the process has
not yet been established.
Treatment of SCHAD-­
deficient patients with hyperinsulinism
is with diazoxide. There is insufficient experience with the non-­
hyperinsulinemic form of SCHAD deficiency at present to recommend
treatment modalities, but prevention of fasting seems advisable.

Short Chain 2,3-­Enoyl-­CoA Hydratase Deficiency

This rare disorder, resulting from pathogenic variants in the ECHS1
gene, was identified through exome sequencing. The disorder affects
a shared pathway of short chain fatty acid and valine metabolism. The
clinical phenotypes are more characteristic of mitochondrial disorders
of pyruvate metabolism with predominantly a Leigh-­like disease (see
Chapters 108 and 638.2) with profound and often-­fatal lactic acidosis.
No treatment modalities or specific biomarkers have been established.
Several patients were found to excrete increased levels of methacrylylglycine, a highly reactive and potentially toxic intermediate;
2-­methyl-­2.3 dihydroxybutyrate; S-­(2-­carboxypropyl) cysteine; and S-­
(2-­carboxpropyl) cysteamine.

864 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
DEFECTS IN THE CARNITINE CYCLE
Plasma Membrane Carnitine Transport Defect
(Primary Carnitine Deficiency)

Primary carnitine deficiency is the only genetic defect in which carnitine deficiency is the cause, rather than the consequence, of impaired
fatty acid oxidation. The most common presentation is progressive cardiomyopathy with or without skeletal muscle weakness beginning at
age 1-­4 years. A smaller number of patients may present with fasting
hypoketotic hypoglycemia in the first year of life, before the cardiomyopathy becomes evident. Cardiac arrythmias are often seen. A common pathogenic variant causes late-­onset disease in the Faroe Islands
with sudden death caused by cardiomyopathy and/or arrhythmia. The
underlying defect involves the high-­affinity plasma membrane sodium
gradient–dependent carnitine transporter encoded by the SLC22A5
gene that is expressed at high levels in heart, muscle, and kidney. This
transporter is responsible both for maintaining intracellular carnitine
concentrations 20-­to 50-­fold higher than plasma concentrations and
for renal conservation of carnitine.
Diagnosis of the carnitine transporter defect is aided by patients
having extremely reduced carnitine levels in plasma and muscle (1–2%
of normal). Heterozygote parents have plasma carnitine levels approximately 50% of normal. Fasting ketogenesis may be normal because liver
carnitine transport is normal, but it may become impaired if dietary
carnitine intake is interrupted. The fasting urinary organic acid profile
may show a hypoketotic dicarboxylic aciduria pattern if hepatic fatty
acid oxidation is impaired but is otherwise unremarkable. The defect in
carnitine transport can be demonstrated clinically by the severe reduction in renal carnitine threshold or by in vitro assay of carnitine uptake
using cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. SLC22A5 sequencing is the
most common method to confirm the diagnosis. A common relatively
severe pathogenic variant has been described in the Chinese population in Taiwan. Treatment with pharmacologic doses of oral carnitine
(100-­300 mg/kg/day) is highly effective in correcting the cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness, as well as any impairment in fasting ketogenesis. Muscle total carnitine concentrations remain <5% of normal
on treatment.

Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase-­IA Deficiency

Several dozen infants and children have been described with a deficiency
of the liver and kidney CPT-­I isozyme (CPT-­IA). Clinical manifestations include fasting-­induced hypoketotic hypoglycemia, occasionally
with extremely abnormal LFTs and, rarely, with renal tubular acidosis.
The heart and skeletal muscles are not involved because the muscle
isozyme is unaffected. Fasting urinary organic acid profiles sometimes
show a hypoketotic C6-­C12 dicarboxylic aciduria but may be normal.
Plasma acylcarnitine analysis demonstrates mostly free carnitine with
very little acylated carnitine. This observation has been used to identify CPT-­IA deficiency on newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry. CPT-­IA deficiency is the only fatty acid oxidation disorder in
which plasma total carnitine levels may be elevated, often to 150–200%
of normal. This phenomenon is explained by the absence of inhibitory
effects of long chain acylcarnitines on the renal tubular carnitine transporter in CPT-­IA deficiency. The enzyme defect can be demonstrated
in cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. CPT-­IA deficiency in the fetus
has been associated in a single case report with AFLP in the mother.
A common variant in the CPTIA gene (c.1436C>t, p.Pro479Leu) has
been identified in individuals of Inuit background in the United States,
Canada, and Greenland. This variant is associated with an increased
risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the Inuit population.
The variant can be detected by newborn screening; enzyme activity is
reduced by 80%, and regulation by malonyl-­CoA is lost. It has not been
established whether this variant is a pathologic enzyme variant or an
adaptation to ancient Inuit high-­fat diets. Another pathogenic variant
is common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and leads to infantile
symptoms. Treatment for the severe form of CPT-­IA deficiency that
is found in non-­Inuit populations is similar to that for VLCAD deficiency, with avoidance of situations where fasting ketogenesis is necessary and use of triheptanoin to provide an anaplerotic fuel source. The
need for treatment of the Inuit variant has not yet been determined.

Carnitine:Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency

This defect of the inner mitochondrial membrane carrier protein for
long chain acylcarnitines blocks the entry of long chain fatty acids into
the mitochondria for oxidation. The clinical phenotype of this disorder is driven by a typically severe and generalized impairment of fatty
acid oxidation. Most newborn patients present with attacks of fasting-­
induced hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and cardiorespiratory
collapse. All symptomatic newborns have had evidence of cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. Several patients with a partial translocase deficiency and milder disease without cardiac involvement have
also been identified. No distinctive urinary or plasma organic acids are
noted, although increased levels of plasma long chain acylcarnitines
of chain lengths C16-­C18 are reported, not distinguishable from the
pattern seen in CPT-­II deficiency (see later). Diagnosis can be confirmed using genetic analysis. Functional carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase activity can be measured in cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts.
Treatment is similar to that of VLCAD deficiency and is particularly
effective in reducing the hyperammonemia that is often otherwise persistent in severe patients.

Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase-­II Deficiency

Three forms of CPT-­II deficiency have been described. A severe neonatal lethal presentation associated with a profound enzyme deficiency,
and early death has been reported in newborns with hypoglycemia
and hyperammonemia in association with dysplastic kidneys, cerebral
malformations, and mild facial anomalies. A milder defect is associated with an adult presentation of episodic rhabdomyolysis. The first
episode usually does not occur until late childhood or early adulthood.
Attacks are frequently precipitated by prolonged exercise. There is aching muscle pain and myoglobinuria that may be severe enough to cause
renal failure. Hypoglycemia has not been described, but fasting may
contribute to attacks of myoglobinuria. Muscle biopsy shows increased
deposition of neutral fat. This adult myopathic presentation of CPT­II deficiency is associated with a common CPT2 pathogenic variant,
c.338C>T, p.Ser113Leu, seen as a recurrent pathogenic variant in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population. This pathogenic variant produces a heat-­
labile protein that is unstable to increased muscle temperature during
exercise that may contribute to the myopathic presentation. A third
intermediate form of CPT-­II deficiency presents in infancy or early
childhood with fasting-­induced hepatic failure, cardiomyopathy, and
skeletal myopathy with hypoketotic hypoglycemia but is not associated with the severe developmental changes seen in the neonatal lethal
presentation. This pattern of illness is similar to VLCAD deficiency,
and management is identical. It is often caused by the presence of one
severe pathogenic variant in combination with the mild c.338C>T
variant.
Diagnosis of all forms of CPT-­II deficiency can be made by a combination of molecular genetic analysis and demonstrating deficient
enzyme activity in muscle or other tissues and in cultured fibroblasts.
Severe and intermediate disease can be identified through newborn
screening, but patients homozygous for the common mild variant typically have normal newborn screens.

DEFECTS IN THE ELECTRON TRANSFER PATHWAY
Electron Transfer Flavoprotein and Electron Transfer
Flavoprotein Dehydrogenase Deficiencies (Glutaric
Acidemia Type 2, Multiple Acyl-­CoA Dehydrogenation
Defects)

Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and electron transfer flavoprotein
dehydrogenase (ETF-­DH) function to transfer electrons into the mitochondrial electron transport chain from dehydrogenation reactions
catalyzed by VLCAD, MCAD, SCAD, and glutaryl-­CoA dehydrogenase, four enzymes involved in branched-­chain amino acid (BCAA)
oxidation and sarcosine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenases. Deficiencies of ETF or ETF-­DH produce illness that combines the features
of impaired fatty acid oxidation and impaired oxidation of several
amino acids. Complete deficiencies of either protein are associated
with severe illness in the newborn period, characterized by acidosis,
hypoketotic hypoglycemia, coma, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and

an unusual odor of sweaty feet caused by isovaleryl-­CoA dehydrogenase inhibition. Some affected neonates have had congenital facial
dysmorphism and polycystic kidneys similar to those in severe CPT-­II
deficiency, which suggests that toxic effects of accumulated metabolites may occur in utero. Most severely affected infants do not survive
the neonatal period. Disorders of cellular or mitochondrial riboflavin
transport or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD, an essential cofactor for
the acyl-­CoA dehydrogenases) have been identified with similar biochemical profiles to ETF and ETF-­DH deficiency but with more variable features.
Diagnosis can be made from the newborn blood spot acylcarnitine
profile and urinary organic acids; both tests show abnormalities corresponding to disruptions in the oxidation of fatty acids (ethylmalonate and C6-­C10 dicarboxylic acids), lysine (glutarate), and BCAAs
(isovaleryl-­, isobutyryl-­, and 2-­methylbutyrylglycine). The diagnosis
can be confirmed by genetic testing of ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH. If no
pathogenic variants in these genes are identified, additional testing for
the riboflavin transport and FAD synthesis genes should be pursued.
Partial deficiencies of ETF and ETF-­DH produce a disorder that
may mimic MCAD deficiency or other milder long-­chain fatty acid
oxidation defects with attacks of fasting hypoketotic coma. The urinary organic acid profile reveals primarily elevations of dicarboxylic
acids and ethylmalonate, derived from short chain fatty acid intermediates. Secondary carnitine deficiency is present. Some patients with
mild forms of ETF/ETF-­DH deficiency may benefit from treatment
with high doses of riboflavin, a precursor of the various flavoproteins
involved in electron transfer.

of life; hypoglycemia is not always present. The differential includes
ketotic hypoglycemia associated with milder forms of glycogen storage disease, such as phosphorylase or phosphorylase kinase deficiency
(see Chapter 107). Treatment for acute episodes includes IV dextrose
to suppress lipolysis and inhibit ongoing ketogenesis. Long-­term treatment includes avoidance of prolonged fasting stress. The diagnosis
should be suspected by unusually severe ketosis and delayed suppression of ketones after starting treatment with dextrose. There are no specific metabolic markers or newborn screening methods. The diagnosis
can be established by genetic sequencing of SLC16A1.

DEFECTS IN THE KETONE SYNTHESIS PATHWAY

β-­Ketothiolase Deficiency

The final steps in production of ketones from mitochondrial fatty acid
β-­oxidation convert acetyl-­CoA to acetoacetate through two enzymes
of the HMG-­CoA pathway (see Fig. 106.2).

β-­Hydroxy-­β-­Methylglutaryl-­CoA (HMG-­CoA)
Synthase Deficiency

See Chapter 103.6.
HMG-­CoA synthase is the rate-­limiting step in the conversion of
acetyl-­CoA derived from fatty acid β-­oxidation in the liver to ketones.
The presentation of deficiency is one of fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia without evidence of impaired cardiac or skeletal muscle function.
The urinary organic acid profile shows only a nonspecific hypoketotic
dicarboxylic aciduria. Plasma and tissue carnitine levels are normal,
in contrast to all the other disorders of fatty acid oxidation. A separate
synthase enzyme, present in cytosol for cholesterol biosynthesis, is not
affected. The HMG-­CoA synthase defect is expressed only in the liver
and kidney and cannot be demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts. The
diagnosis can be made by genetic testing. Avoiding fasting is usually a
successful treatment.

β-­Hydroxy-­β-­Methylglutaryl-­CoA Lyase Deficiency
(3 Hydroxy-­3-­Methylgutaric Aciduria)
See Chapter 105.6.

DEFECTS IN KETONE BODY UTILIZATION

The ketone bodies β-­hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are the end
products of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and are important metabolic
fuels for the brain during fasting. Three defects in utilization of ketones
in brain and other peripheral tissues present as episodes of hyperketotic coma, with or without hypoglycemia.

Monocarboxylate Transporter-­1 Deficiency

About 10 patients have been described with recurrent episodes of
potentially lethal ketoacidosis, with or without hypoglycemia, caused
by a deficiency of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), a plasma
membrane carrier encoded by SLC16A1 that is required to transport
ketones into tissues from plasma. Although the first cases identified
were homozygous for inactivating pathogenic variants of SLC16A1,
heterozygous carriers can also be affected. Affected patients develop
severe ketoacidosis provoked by fasting or infections in their first years

Succinyl-­CoA:3-­Ketoacid-­CoA Transferase Deficiency

See Chapter 103.6.
The characteristic presentation of succinyl-­
CoA:3-­
ketoacid-­
CoA
transferase (SCOT) deficiency is an infant with recurrent episodes of
severe ketoacidosis induced by fasting. Plasma acylcarnitine and urine
organic acid abnormalities do not distinguish SCOT deficiency from
other causes of ketoacidosis. Treatment of episodes requires infusion
of glucose and large amounts of bicarbonate until metabolic stability is
reestablished. Patients usually exhibit inappropriate, persistent hyperketonemia even between episodes of illness. SCOT is responsible for
activating acetoacetate in peripheral tissues, using succinyl CoA as a
donor to form acetoacetyl-­CoA. Deficient enzyme activity can be demonstrated in the brain, muscle, and fibroblasts from affected patients.
The gene has been cloned, and numerous pathogenic variants have
been characterized. The diagnosis is usually established by sequencing
analysis of the OXCT1 gene that encodes the SCOT enzyme.

106.2 Disorders of Very Long Chain
Fatty Acids and Other Peroxisomal
Functions
Michael F. Wangler

PEROXISOMAL DISORDERS

Disorders of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) fall within the
broader group of peroxisomal diseases. The peroxisomal diseases are
genetically determined disorders caused either by the failure to form
or maintain the peroxisome or by a defect in the function of a single
protein that is localized to the peroxisome. These disorders cause serious disability in childhood and occur more frequently and present a
wider range of phenotypes than recognized in the past. Many, but not
all, peroxisomal disorders are associated with elevations of VLCFAs.

Etiology

Peroxisomal disorders are subdivided into two major categories (Table
106.2). In the peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs), the basic
defect is the failure to import one or more proteins into the organelle.
In the other group, defects affect a single peroxisomal protein (single-­
enzyme defects). The peroxisome is present in all cells except mature
erythrocytes and is a subcellular organelle surrounded by a single
membrane; there are >50 peroxisomal enzymes. Some enzymes are
involved in the production and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
and others in lipid and amino acid metabolism. Peroxisomal enzymes
have a unique system to ship them to the peroxisome that uses specific peroxisome targeting sequences (PTSs). These enzymes are first
synthesized in their mature form on free polyribosomes and float free
in the cytoplasm until their specific PTS is recognized. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins contain a PTS1, a short amino acid sequence
at the carboxyl terminus. In addition, the amino-­terminal–located
PTS2 is critical for the import of enzymes involved in plasmalogen

and branched-­chain fatty acid metabolism. The peroxisome biogenesis
machinery then recognizes, binds, and targets PTS-­containing proteins
to the peroxisome. This process involves a complex series of reactions
mediated by at least 23 distinct proteins. These proteins, referred to as
peroxins, are encoded by the PEX genes. Pathogenic genetic variants in
these genes are the cause of PBDs.

Epidemiology

Except for X-­linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), all the peroxisomal
disorders listed in Table 106.2 are inherited as autosomal recessive diseases. ALD is the most common peroxisomal disorder, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 17,000 live births. The combined incidence
of the other peroxisomal disorders is estimated to be 1 in 50,000 live
births, although with broader newborn screening, it is expected that
the actual incidences of all the disorders of VLCFAs will be more accurately established.

Pathology

Absence or reduction in the number of peroxisomes is pathognomonic for disorders of peroxisome biogenesis. In most cases, a close
examination of cells in these patients reveals membranous sacs that
lack the normal complement of matrix proteins; these are peroxisome
“ghosts,” and they indicate the inability of the cell to properly localize
peroxisomal proteins. Pathologic changes are observed in most organs
and include profound and characteristic defects in neuronal migration, micronodular cirrhosis of the liver, renal cysts, chondrodysplasia
punctata, sensorineural hearing loss, retinopathy, congenital heart disease, and dysmorphic features.

Pathogenesis

Clinical pathologic changes of the PBDs are secondary to the underlying peroxisome biogenesis defect. As a result, multiple peroxisomal
enzymes fail to function in the PBDs (Table 106.3). PBDs include the
Zellweger spectrum disorders (PBD-­ZSD) and one form of rhizomelic
chondrodysplasia punctata (PBD-­RCDP), which are distinguished by
clinical phenotype and differences in the extent of biogenesis abnormality. In PBDs, enzymes that are synthesized cannot be properly
located to the peroxisome and are thus degraded abnormally quickly
because they are unprotected outside the peroxisome. However, it has
yet to be clarified as to how specific peroxisome defects lead to each of
the pathologic manifestations.
Pathogenic variants in 14 different PEX genes have been identified in PBDs. For PBD-­RCDP, PEX7 pathogenic variants are the most

common, but rarer PEX5 pathogenic variants are seen. The pattern
and severity of pathologic features vary with the nature of the import
defects and the degree of import impairment leading to the severity
spectrum of PBD-­ZSD. These gene defects lead to disorders named
prior to recognizing their relationship to the peroxisome, namely, Zellweger syndrome, neonatal ALD, infantile Refsum disease, and RCDP.
The first three disorders are considered to be a form of clinical continuum,
with Zellweger syndrome the most severe (severe PBD-­ZSD), infantile
Refsum disease the least severe (mild PBD-­ZSD), and neonatal ALD
being intermediate (intermediate PBD-­ZSD). For PBD-­ZSD, 13 genes
can be affected to result in autosomal recessive disease (PEX1, PEX2,
PEX3, PEX5, PEX6, PEX10, PEX11B, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16,
PEX19, PEX26). Specific gene defects cannot be distinguished by clinical features. Clinical severity varies with the degree to which protein
import is impaired. Pathogenic variants that completely abolish import
are often associated with the severe PBD-­ZSD or Zellweger phenotype,
whereas a missense variant, in which some degree of import function
is retained, leads to the somewhat milder presentations. A defect in
PEX7 or, very rarely, PEX5, which depend on peroxisomal import that
use PTS2, is associated with RCDP. PEX7 defects that leave the import
partially intact are associated with milder phenotypes, some of which
resemble classic (adult) Refsum disease.
The genetic disorders that involve single peroxisomal enzymes usually have clinical manifestations that are more restricted and relate to
the single biochemical defect. The primary adrenal insufficiency of
ALD is caused by an accumulation of VLCFAs in the adrenal cortex,
and the peripheral neuropathy in adult Refsum disease is caused by the
accumulation of phytanic acid in Schwann cells and myelin.

PBD-­ZSD

Newborn infants with severe PBD-­ZSD, previously described as Zellweger
syndrome, show striking and consistent recognizable abnormalities.
Of central diagnostic importance are the typical facial appearance (large
anterior fontanelle, wide sutures, high forehead, hypoplastic supraorbital
ridges, flat face, and broad nasal bridge; Fig. 106.3), severe weakness
and hypotonia, neonatal seizures, and eye abnormalities. Because of
the hypotonia and craniofacial appearance, Down syndrome may be
suspected in neonates. Infants with severe PBD-­ZSD rarely live more
than a few months. More than 90% show postnatal growth failure.
Table 106.4 lists the main clinical abnormalities.
Patients with intermediate PBD-­ZSD, previously described as neonatal
ALD, show fewer, less prominent craniofacial features. Neonatal
seizures occur frequently. Psychomotor developmental delay is present; function remains in the range of severe intellectual disability, and
development may regress after 3-­5 years of age, likely from progressive
leukodystrophy. Hepatomegaly, impaired liver function, pigmentary
degeneration of the retina, and severely impaired hearing are invariably
present. Adrenocortical function is usually impaired and may require
adrenal hormone replacement. Chondrodysplasia punctata and renal
cysts are absent.
Patients with mild PBD-­ZSD, previously described as infantile
Refsum disease, have survived to adulthood. They can walk, although
gait may be ataxic and broad based. Cognitive function is generally

of both vision and hearing impairment. Almost all have some degree
of sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentary degeneration of the
retina. They have moderately dysmorphic features that may include
epicanthal folds, a flat nose bridge, and low-­set ears. Early hypotonia
and hepatomegaly with impaired function are common. Levels of
plasma cholesterol and high-­density and low-­density lipoprotein are
often moderately reduced. Chondrodysplasia punctata and renal cortical cysts are absent. Postmortem study in these mild PBD-­ZSD cases
reveals micronodular liver cirrhosis and small, hypoplastic adrenals.
The brain shows no malformations, except for severe hypoplasia of the
cerebellar granule layer and ectopic locations of the Purkinje cells in
the molecular layer.
Some patients with PBD-­ZSD have milder and atypical phenotypes.
They may present with peripheral neuropathy or with retinopathy,
impaired vision, or cataracts in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood
and have been considered to have Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease or
Usher syndrome. Some patients with PEX16 variants present with cerebellar ataxia. Some patients have survived to the fifth decade.

Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata

RCDP is characterized by the presence of stippled foci of calcification
within the hyaline cartilage and is associated with short stature, cataracts (72%), and multiple malformations caused by contractures. Vertebral bodies have coronal clefting filled by cartilage that results from an

parts of the extremities (rhizomelia; Fig. 106.4A). Radiologic abnormalities consist of shortening of the proximal limb bones, metaphyseal cupping, and disturbed punctate ossification (Fig. 106.4B). Height,
weight, and head circumference are less than the third percentile, and
these children have a severe intellectual disability. Skin changes such as
those observed in ichthyosiform erythroderma are present in approximately 25% of patients. RCDP can be caused by pathogenic variants
in one of four genes (PEX5, PEX7, AGPS, GNPAT). Defects in PEX7,
which most frequently lead to the RCDP phenotype, may also lead to a
milder phenotype with clinical manifestations similar to those of adult
Refsum disease, a later-­onset disorder described later.

Isolated Defects of Peroxisomal Fatty Acid Oxidation

In the group of single-­enzyme defects, acyl-­CoA oxidase and bifunctional enzyme deficiency involve a single enzymatic step in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Defects of bifunctional enzyme are found
in approximately 15% of patients who are initially suspected of having
PBD-­ZSD. Patients with isolated acyl-­C oA oxidase deficiency have
a somewhat milder phenotype that resembles mild or intermediate
PBD-ZSD or Usher syndrome and typically comes to attention because
of the development of an early childhood leukodystrophy.

868 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Atypical Autosomal Dominant Disorders

Peroxisomal disorders are classically autosomal recessive in family
pedigrees. X-­linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a key exception. Several
other exceptions of rare dominant inheritance of peroxisomal disease
manifesting as neurologic disease have emerged for a few peroxisomal
genes, including ACOX1, PEX6, and DNM1L.

Isolated Defects of Plasmalogen Synthesis

Plasmalogens are lipids in which the first of three glycerol carbons
is linked to an alcohol rather than a fatty acid. They are synthesized
through a complex series of reactions, the first two steps of which
are catalyzed by the peroxisomal enzymes dihydroxyacetone phosphate alkyl transferase (DHAPT, encoded by the gene GNPAT) and
synthase (AGPS, encoded by the gene AGPS). Deficiency of either of
these enzymes leads to RCDP types 2 and 3, respectively, phenotypes
that are clinically indistinguishable from each other and from the peroxisomal import disorder RCDP1. This latter disorder is caused by a
defect in PEX7, the receptor for PTS2 upon which DHAPT and AGPS
are dependent for peroxisomal import. RCDP1 shares the severe deficiency of plasmalogens with these single-­enzyme disorders but also has
defects of phytanic oxidation. The fact that these single genetic disorders are associated with the full phenotype of RCDP suggests that a
deficiency of plasmalogens is sufficient to produce it.

Adult (Classic) Refsum Disease

The defective enzyme (phytanoyl-­CoA hydroxylase, encoded by the
PHYH gene) is localized to the peroxisome. The manifestation of
Refsum disease includes impaired vision from retinitis pigmentosa,
anosmia, ichthyosis, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and occasionally
cardiac arrhythmias. In contrast to infantile Refsum disease, cognitive function is normal, and there are no congenital malformations.
Refsum disease often does not manifest until young adulthood, but
visual disturbances such as night blindness, ichthyosis, and peripheral neuropathy may already be present in childhood and adolescence. Early diagnosis is important because institution of a phytanic
acid–restricted diet can reverse the peripheral neuropathy and prevent the progression of the visual and central nervous system (CNS)
manifestations. Adult Refsum disease may also be caused by defects
in PEX7.

2-­Methylacyl-­CoA Racemase Deficiency (AMACR)

This disorder is caused by an enzyme defect that leads to the accumulation of the branched-­chain fatty acids (phytanic and pristanic
acid) and bile acids. Individuals present with typically an adult-­onset
peripheral neuropathy and may also have pigmentary degeneration of
the retina.

Clinical suspicion would be followed by specific biochemical determination of an abnormality and then confirmation through genetic testing targeted to specific genes. However, an extended gene panel and
exome and genome testing have been used to identify pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in peroxisomal genes.
These patients still require biochemical testing for confirmation. In addition, newborn screening for X-­linked ALD using dried blood spots on
filter paper in states across the United States and many parts of Europe
also identifies other forms of peroxisomal deficiency. Early recognition
of peroxisomal disorders in newborns will be a clinical reality.
Whether based on clinical suspicion, an abnormal newborn screen,
or reported genetic variants, the biochemical characterization of peroxisomal disorders is a necessary step and uses the generally available
testing strategy listed in Table 106.5. Measurement of plasma VLCFA
levels is the most common assay. It must be emphasized that although
plasma VLCFA levels are elevated in many patients with peroxisomal
disorders and the same defect is the indirect basis for the newborn
screen assay, this is not always the case. The most important exception
is RCDP, in which VLCFA levels are normal but plasma phytanic acid
levels are increased and red blood cell (RBC) plasmalogen levels are
reduced. In other peroxisomal disorders, the biochemical abnormalities are still more restricted. Therefore a panel of tests is recommended
and includes plasma levels of VLCFAs and phytanic, pristanic, and
pipecolic acids and RBC levels of plasmalogens. Tandem mass spectrometry techniques also permit convenient quantitation of bile acids
in plasma and urine. This panel of tests can be performed on very small
amounts of venous blood and permits detection of most peroxisomal
disorders.
Definition of the molecular defect either through gene panel testing
or exome sequencing in the proband is essential for carrier detection
and speeds prenatal diagnosis. Characterization of the pathogenic
variant may be of prognostic value in patients with PEX1 defects. This
defect is present in approximately 60% of PBD patients, and about
half the PEX1 defects have the G843D allele, which is associated with
a significantly milder phenotype than found in other pathogenic
variants.

Diagnosis

Several noninvasive laboratory tests permit precise and early diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders (see Table 106.5). The challenge in PBDs
is to differentiate them from the large variety of other conditions that
can cause hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, or dysmorphic features.
Experienced clinicians readily recognize classic Zellweger syndrome
by its clinical manifestations. However, more mildly affected PBD-­ZSD
patients often do not show the full clinical spectrum of disease and
may be identifiable only by laboratory assays. Clinical features that
warrant diagnostic assessment include intellectual disability; weakness
and hypotonia; dysmorphic features; neonatal seizures; retinopathy,
glaucoma, or cataracts; hearing deficits; enlarged liver and impaired
liver function; and chondrodysplasia punctata. The presence of one or
more of these abnormalities increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.
Atypical milder forms presenting as peripheral neuropathy have also
been described.
Some patients with the isolated defects of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resemble those with ZSD and can be detected by the demonstration of abnormally high levels of VLCFAs.
Patients with RCDP must be distinguished from patients with other
causes of chondrodysplasia punctata. RCDP is suspected clinically
because of the shortness of limbs, developmental delays, and ichthyosis. The most decisive laboratory test is the demonstration of abnormally low plasmalogen levels in RBCs and an alteration in PEX7.

Complications

Patients with severe PBD-­ZSD have multiple disabilities involving

is poor, and most patients succumb in the first years of life. Similarly,
individuals with RCDP have multiple systemic and neurologic issues.
In addition, they may develop spinal cord compression at any level of
the spine.

with over half these being private or unique to the family. There is no
genotype-­phenotype correlation, as wide ranges of clinical severity can
occur within a family across multiple individuals with the same pathogenic variant. A curated database of pathogenic variants is maintained
(www.x-­ald.nl). The mechanism by which the ALDP defect leads to
VLCFA accumulation appears to be a disruption of transport of saturated fatty acids into the peroxisome, with resultant continued progressive elongation of fatty acids.

Treatment

Epidemiology

The most effective therapy is the dietary treatment of adult Refsum disease with a phytanic acid–restricted diet. However, this only applies to
this specific condition.
For patients with the somewhat milder variants of the peroxisome
import disorders, success has been achieved with multidisciplinary
early intervention, including physical and occupational therapy, hearing aids or cochlear implants, augmentative and alternative communication, nutrition, and support for the families. Although most patients
continue to function in the impaired range, some make significant
gains in self-­help skills, and several are in stable condition in their teens
or even early 20s.
Attempts to mitigate some of the secondary biochemical abnormalities include the oral administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The
DHA level is greatly reduced in patients with disorders of peroxisome
biogenesis, and this therapy normalizes DHA plasma levels. Although
there were anecdotal reports of clinical improvement with DHA therapy,
a randomized placebo-­controlled study failed to find benefit.

Genetic Counseling

Most of these disorders can be diagnosed prenatally. Prenatal testing
using chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis enables genetic testing when the alteration is known, but biochemical measurements may
be made using the same tests as described for postnatal diagnosis (see
Table 106.5). Because of the 25% recurrence risk with autosomal recessive inheritance, couples with an affected child should be advised about
the availability of prenatal and preconception diagnosis.

ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY

ALD is an X-­linked disorder associated with the accumulation of saturated VLCFAs and a progressive dysfunction of the adrenal cortex and
nervous system. It is the most common peroxisomal disorder.

Etiology

The key biochemical abnormality in ALD is the tissue accumulation of
saturated VLCFAs, with a carbon chain length of 24 or more. Excess
hexacosanoic acid (C26:0) is the most striking and characteristic feature. This accumulation of fatty acids is caused by genetically deficient
peroxisomal degradation of fatty acid. The defective gene (ABCD1)
codes for a peroxisomal membrane protein (ALDP, the ALD protein).
Many alterations in ABCD1 have been determined to be pathogenic,

The incidence of ALD in males is 1 in 21,000, and the combined incidence of ALD males and heterozygous females in the general population is estimated to be 1 in 17,000. All ethnicities are affected. The
various phenotypes often occur in members of the same kindred.

Pathology

Characteristic lamellar cytoplasmic inclusions can be demonstrated
on electron microscopy in adrenocortical cells, testicular Leydig cells,
and nervous system macrophages. These inclusions probably consist of
cholesterol esterified with VLCFA. They are most prominent in cells of
the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, which at first are distended
with lipids and subsequently atrophy.
The nervous system displays two types of ALD lesions. In the severe
cerebral form, demyelination is associated with an inflammatory
response manifested by the accumulation of perivascular lymphocytes
that is most intense in the involved region. In the slowly progressive
adult form, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the main finding is a
distal axonopathy that affects the long tracts in the spinal cord. In this
form the inflammatory response is mild or absent.

Pathogenesis

The adrenal dysfunction is probably a direct consequence of the accumulation of VLCFAs. The cells in the adrenal zona fasciculata are
distended with abnormal lipids. Cholesterol esterified to VLCFA is
relatively resistant to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)–stimulated cholesterol ester hydrolases, and this limits the capacity to convert cholesterol to active steroids. In addition, C26:0 excess increases the
viscosity of the plasma membrane, which may interfere with receptor
and other cellular functions.
There is no defined correlation between the neurologic phenotype
and the nature of the pathogenic variant or the severity of the biochemical defect as assessed by plasma VLCFA levels or between the degree
of adrenal involvement and nervous system involvement. The severity
of the illness and rate of progression correlate with the intensity of the
inflammatory response. The inflammatory response may be partially
cytokine mediated and may involve an autoimmune response triggered
in an unknown way by the excess of VLCFAs. Mitochondrial damage
and oxidative stress also appear to contribute. Approximately half the
patients do not experience the inflammatory response, although the
basis of this difference is not understood.

870 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Clinical Manifestations

There are five relatively distinct ALD phenotypes, three of which present in childhood with symptoms and signs. In all the phenotypes,
development is usually normal in the first 3-­4 years of life.
In the childhood cerebral form of ALD, symptoms most often are
first noted between ages 4 and 8 years. The most common initial manifestations are hyperactivity, inattention, and worsening school performance in a child who had previously been a good student. Auditory
discrimination is often impaired, although tone perception is preserved.
This may be evidenced by difficulty in using the telephone and greatly
impaired performance on intelligence tests in items that are presented
verbally. Spatial orientation is often impaired. Other initial symptoms
are disturbances of vision, ataxia, poor handwriting, seizures, and
strabismus. Visual disturbances are often caused by involvement of
the parietooccipital cortex rather than eye or optic tract abnormalities, which leads to variable and seemingly inconsistent visual capacity.
Seizures occur in most patients and may represent the first manifestation of the disease. Some patients present with increased intracranial
pressure. Impaired cortisol response to ACTH stimulation is present in
85% of patients, and mild hyperpigmentation is noted. In most patients
with this phenotype, adrenal dysfunction is recognized only after the
condition is diagnosed because of the cerebral symptoms. Cerebral
childhood ALD tends to progress rapidly with increasing spasticity and
paralysis, visual and hearing loss, and loss of ability to speak or swallow. The mean interval between the first neurologic symptom and an
apparently unresponsive wakeful state is 1.9 years. Patients may continue in this apparently unresponsive wakeful state for ≥10 years.
Adolescent ALD designates patients who experience neurologic
symptoms between ages 10 and 21 years. The manifestations resemble
those of childhood cerebral ALD except that progression is slower.
Approximately 10% of patients present acutely with status epilepticus,
adrenal crisis, acute encephalopathy, or coma.
AMN first manifests in late adolescence or adulthood as a progressive paraparesis caused by long tract degeneration in the spinal cord.
Approximately half the affected males also have involvement of the
cerebral white matter.
The Addison-­only phenotype is an important condition. Of male
patients with Addison disease, 25% may have the biochemical defect of
ALD. Many of these patients have intact neurologic systems, whereas
others have subtle neurologic signs. Many acquire AMN in adulthood.
The term asymptomatic ALD is applied to persons who have the
biochemical defect of ALD but are free of neurologic or endocrinal disturbances. Almost all persons with the gene defect eventually become
neurologically symptomatic.
Approximately 50% of female heterozygotes acquire a syndrome that
resembles AMN but is milder and of later onset. Adrenal insufficiency
and cerebral disease are rare.
Cases of typical ALD have occurred in relatives of those with AMN.
One of the most difficult problems in the management of ALD is the
common observation that affected individuals in the same family may
have quite different clinical courses. For example, in one family, an
affected male may have severe classic ALD culminating in death by age
10 years, and another brother will have the later-­onset AMN.

Laboratory and Radiographic Findings

The most specific and important laboratory finding is the demonstration of abnormally high levels of VLCFAs in plasma, RBCs, or cultured
skin fibroblasts. Positive results are obtained in all male patients with
ALD and in approximately 85% of female carriers of ALD. Pathogenic
variant analysis is the most reliable method for the identification of
carriers. Simply finding a variation in ABCD1 is not adequate for making the diagnosis of ALD. It must be shown to segregate with elevated
VLCFA levels.

Neuroimaging

Patients with childhood cerebral or adolescent ALD have characteristic
white matter lesions on MRI. In 80% of patients, the lesions are symmetric and involve the splenium of the corpus callosum and periventricular white matter in the posterior parietal and occipital lobes. Many

will show a garland of contrast enhancement adjacent and anterior to
the posterior hypodense lesions (Fig. 106.5). This zone corresponds to
the zones of intense perivascular lymphocytic infiltration where the
blood-­brain barrier breaks down. In 10–15% of patients, the initial
lesions are frontal. Unilateral lesions that produce a mass effect suggestive of a brain tumor may occur rarely. MRI provides a clearer delineation of normal and abnormal white matter than does CT and is the
preferred imaging modality.

Impaired Adrenal Function

More than 85% of patients with the childhood form of ALD have elevated levels of ACTH in plasma and a subnormal rise of cortisol levels
in plasma after IV injection of ACTH.

Newborn Screening and Diagnosis

Diagnosis of asymptomatic males is available by newborn screening,
which allows for early diagnosis of ALD years before the manifestations of disease. Males then enter a program of surveillance for adrenal
insufficiency and early detection of potential cerebral disease. Females
identified through these programs should also have confirmatory testing, genetic counseling for the family, and screening of other at-­risk
males. Females do not generally require any other monitoring in childhood. This early screening paradigm allows for early surveillance of
ALD neurologic symptoms, which are difficult to distinguish from
the more common attention-­deficit disorders or learning disabilities
of school-­age children. Early diagnosis could lead to early cortisol
treatment for adrenal problems, which could be life-­threatening. Early
bone marrow transplant is likely to result as a benefit of screening. For
positive newborn screens or for individuals with clinical suspicion of
ALD, confirmatory VLCFA testing and genetic counseling should be
provided.

The Earliest Manifestations of Childhood
Cerebral ALD

Rapid progression, signs of dementia, or difficulty in auditory discrimination suggest ALD. Even in early stages, neuroimaging shows
abnormal changes. Other leukodystrophies or multiple sclerosis may
sometimes mimic these radiographic findings, although early ALD has
more of a predilection for the posterior brain than its mimics. Definitive diagnosis depends on demonstration of VLCFA excess, which
occurs only in ALD and the other peroxisomal disorders.
Cerebral forms of ALD, especially if asymmetric, may be misdiagnosed as gliomas or other mass lesions. Individuals have received
brain biopsy and, rarely, other therapies before the correct diagnosis
was made. Measurement of VLCFAs in plasma is the most reliable differentiating test.
Adolescent or adult cerebral ALD can be confused with psychiatric
disorders, dementing disorders, multiple sclerosis, or epilepsy. The first
clue to the diagnosis of ALD may be the demonstration of characteristic
white matter lesions by neuroimaging; VLCFA assays are confirmatory.
ALD cannot be distinguished clinically from other forms of Addison
disease; it is recommended that assays of VLCFA levels be performed

Chapter 106 u Defects in Metabolism of Lipids
in all male patients with Addison disease. ALD patients do not usually
have antibodies to adrenal tissue in their plasma.

Complications

An avoidable complication is the occurrence of adrenal insufficiency.
The most difficult neurologic problems are those related to bed rest,
contracture, coma, and swallowing disturbances. Other complications
involve behavioral disturbances and injuries associated with defects of
spatial orientation, impaired vision and hearing, and seizures.

Treatment

Corticosteroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency or adrenocortical
hypofunction is effective. It may be lifesaving and may increase general
strength and well-­being, but it does not alter the course of the neurologic disability.

Bone Marrow Transplantation

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or hematopoietic stem cell
therapy (HSCT) benefits patients who show early evidence of the
inflammatory demyelination characteristic of the rapidly progressive
neurologic disability in young males and adolescents with the cerebral
ALD phenotype. BMT carries risk, and patients must be evaluated and
selected with care. The mechanism of the beneficial effect is incompletely understood. Bone marrow–derived cells do express ALDP, the
protein that is deficient in ALD; approximately 50% of brain microglial
cells are bone marrow derived. The favorable effect may be caused by
modification of the brain inflammatory response. Follow-­up of young
males and adolescents who had early cerebral involvement has shown
stabilization. On the other hand, BMT does not arrest the course in
those who already had severe brain involvement and may accelerate disease progression under these circumstances. The ALD MRI
score and the use of performance measures on IQ testing have shown
some predictive ability for boys likely to benefit from this procedure.
Transplant is not recommended in patients with performance IQ significantly <80. Unfortunately, in more than half the patients who are
diagnosed because of neurologic symptoms, the illness is so advanced
at diagnosis that they are not candidates for transplant.
Consideration of BMT is most relevant in neurologically asymptomatic or mildly involved patients. Screening at-­risk relatives of symptomatic
patients identifies these patients most frequently. Screening by measurement of plasma VLCFA levels in patients with Addison disease may also
identify candidates for BMT. Because of its risk (10–20% mortality) and
because up to 50% of untreated patients with ALD do not develop inflammatory brain demyelination, transplant is not recommended in patients
who are free of demonstrable brain involvement on MRI. MRI is also of
key importance for the crucial decision of whether transplant should be
performed. MRI abnormalities precede clinically evident neurologic or
neuropsychologic abnormalities. The brain MRI should be monitored
at 6-­month intervals in neurologically asymptomatic young males and
adolescents age 3-­15 years. If the MRI is normal, BMT is not indicated.
If brain MRI abnormalities develop, the young male should be evaluated
by a center familiar with transplant for ALD. This should include MRI,
neurologic, and neuropsychologic evaluations. It is not known whether
BMT has a favorable effect on the noninflammatory spinal cord involvement in adults with the adrenomyeloneuropathy phenotype.
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (elivaldogene
autotemcel) is approved for patients 4-17 years of age to slow the neurologic progression of early, active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy.

Supportive Therapy

The progressive behavioral and neurologic disturbances associated
with the childhood form of ALD are extremely difficult for the family.
ALD patients require the establishment of a comprehensive management program and partnership among the family, physician, visiting
nursing staff, school authorities, and counselors. In addition, parent
support groups (e.g., United Leukodystrophy Foundation) are often
helpful. Communication with school authorities is important because
under the provisions of Public Law 94-­142, children with ALD qualify
for special services as “other health impaired” or “multi-­handicapped.”

871

Depending on the rate of progression of the disease, special needs
might range from relatively low-­level resource services within a regular
school program to home-­and hospital-­based teaching programs for
children who are not mobile.
Management challenges vary with the stage of the illness. The early
stages are characterized by subtle changes in affect, behavior, and attention span. Counseling and communication with school authorities are
of prime importance. Changes in the sleep–wake cycle can be benefited
by the judicious use of nighttime sleep medications.
As the leukodystrophy progresses, the modulation of muscle tone
and support of bulbar muscular function are major concerns. Baclofen
in gradually increasing doses (5 mg twice a day to 25 mg four times
a day) is an effective pharmacologic agent for the treatment of acute
episodic painful muscle spasms. Other agents may also be used, with
care taken to monitor the occurrence of side effects and drug interactions. As the leukodystrophy progresses, bulbar muscular control is
lost. Although initially this can be managed by changing the diet to soft
and pureed foods, most patients eventually require a gastrostomy tube.
At least 30% of patients have focal or generalized seizures that usually
readily respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.

Genetic Counseling and Prevention

Genetic counseling and appropriate monitoring are of crucial importance. Extended-­family screening should be offered to all at-­risk relatives of symptomatic patients; one program led to the identification of
>250 asymptomatic affected males and 1,200 women heterozygous for
ALD. The plasma assay permits reliable identification of affected males
in whom plasma VLCFA levels are increased already on the day of
birth. Identification of asymptomatic males permits institution of steroid replacement therapy when appropriate and prevents adrenal crisis,
which may be fatal. Monitoring of brain MRI also permits identification
of patients who are candidates for BMT at a stage when this procedure
has the greatest chance of success. Plasma VLCFA assay is recommended
in all male patients with Addison disease. ALD has been shown to be the
cause of adrenal insufficiency in >25% of boys with Addison disease of
unknown cause. Identification of women heterozygous for ALD is more
difficult than that of affected males. Plasma VLCFA levels are normal
in 15–20% of heterozygous women, and failure to note this has led to
serious errors in genetic counseling. DNA analysis permits accurate
identification of carriers, provided that the pathogenic variant has been
defined in a family member, and this is the procedure recommended for
the identification of heterozygous women.
Prenatal diagnosis of affected male fetuses can be achieved by determination of the known pathogenic variant or by the measurement of VLCFA
levels in cultured amniocytes or chorionic villus cells. Whenever a new
patient with ALD is identified, a detailed pedigree should be constructed
and efforts made to identify all at-­risk female carriers and affected males.
These investigations should be accompanied by careful and sympathetic
attention to social, emotional, and ethical issues during counseling.

106.3 Disorders of Lipoprotein Metabolism
and Transport
Lee A. Pyles

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF BLOOD LIPIDS AND
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE

There is a strong association between average intake of saturated fats,
plasma cholesterol, and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD).
Of all common chronic diseases, none is so clearly influenced by
both environmental and genetic factors as CHD. This multifactorial
disorder is strongly associated with increasing age and male gender,
although it is increasingly apparent that heart disease is underrecognized in women. Tobacco use confers a twofold higher lifetime risk.

872 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Sedentary activity and high intake of processed sugars leading to adiposity increase risk through differences in the plasma levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. Family history reflects the combined influence of
lifestyle and genetic predisposition to early heart disease. Risk of premature heart disease associated with positive family history is 1.7 times
higher than in families with no such history.
Atherosclerosis begins during childhood. The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study demonstrated that White male medical students with
blood cholesterol levels in the lowest quartile showed only a 10% incidence of CHD 3 decades later, whereas those in the highest quartile had
a 40% incidence. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis
in Youth Study demonstrated a significant relationship between the
weight of the abdominal fat pad and the extent of atherosclerosis found
at autopsy on individuals 15-­34 years of age. The Bogalusa Heart Study
of more than 3,000 Black and White children and adolescents has provided the most comprehensive longitudinal data relating the presence
and severity of CHD risk factors with semi-­quantifiable severity of atherosclerosis. Coronary atherosclerosis was present in 8.5% of military
autopsies performed after combat or unintentional injuries.
The fetal origins hypothesis is based on the observation that infants
born with low birthweight have a higher incidence of heart disease as
adults. Epidemiologic studies support the idea that prenatal and early
postnatal conditions may affect adult health status. Children who are
large for gestational age at birth and exposed to an intrauterine environment of either diabetes or maternal obesity are at increased risk of
eventually developing metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, type 2
diabetes, obesity, CHD). Breastfeeding preterm infants confers a long-­
term cardioprotective benefit 13-­16 years later. Those adolescents who
were breastfed as infants had lower C-­reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and a 14% lower low-­density lipoprotein (LDL)/high-­density
lipoprotein (HDL) ratio than formula-­fed infants. The impact of early
nutrition and other lifestyle variables on gene expression via epigenetics
is one mechanism by which adult metabolism and body composition
may be influenced.
Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia may be the result of drugs
(cyclosporine, corticosteroids, isotretinoin, protease inhibitors, alcohol, thiazide diuretics, β-­blocking agents, valproate) or various diseases
(nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, anorexia
nervosa, obstructive jaundice). Psychotropic medications, including
second-­generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine, are also associated with dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance.

BLOOD LIPIDS AND ATHEROGENESIS

Numerous epidemiologic studies demonstrate the association of
hypercholesterolemia, referring to elevated total, non-­HDL, and LDL

blood cholesterol, with atherosclerotic disease. Atherosclerosis affects
primarily the coronary arteries but may also involve the aorta, arteries
of the lower extremities, and carotid arteries.
The early stage of development of atherosclerosis is thought to begin
with vascular endothelial dysfunction and intima-­media thickness,
which has been shown to occur in preadolescent children with risk
factors such as obesity or familial hypercholesterolemia. The complex
process of penetrating the intimal lining of the vessel may result from a
variety of insults, including the presence of highly toxic oxidized LDL
particles. Lymphocytes and monocytes penetrate the damaged endothelial lining, where they become macrophages laden with LDL lipids
and then become foam cells. Such accumulation is counterbalanced by
HDL particles capable of removing lipid deposits from the vessel wall.
Fundamental to plaque formation is an inflammatory process (elevated
CRP) involving macrophages and the arterial wall. The deposition of
lipid within the subendothelial lining of the arterial wall appears macroscopically as fatty streaks, which may to some degree be reversible.
A later stage of plaque development involves disruption of arterial
smooth muscle cells stimulated by the release of tissue cytokines and
growth factors. The atheroma is composed of a core of fatty substance
separated from the lumen by collagen and smooth muscle (Fig. 106.6).
Growth of the atherosclerotic plaque may result in ischemia of the tissue supplied by the artery. Chronic inflammation within the atheroma
results in plaque instability and subsequent rupture. Platelet adherence
leads to clot formation at the site of rupture, resulting in myocardial
infarction (MI) or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), depending on the
site of thrombosis or thromboembolism.

PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM AND
TRANSPORT

Lipoproteins are soluble complexes of lipids and proteins that effect
transport of fat absorbed from the diet, or synthesis by the liver and
adipose tissues, for utilization and storage. Dietary fat is transported
from the small intestine as chylomicrons. Lipids synthesized by the
liver as very low-­
density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are catabolized to
intermediate-­density lipoproteins (IDLs) and LDLs. HDL is fundamentally involved in VLDL and chylomicron metabolism and cholesterol transport. Nonesterified free fatty acids are metabolically active
lipids derived from lipolysis of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue
and bound to albumin for circulation in the plasma (Fig. 106.7).
Lipoproteins consist of a central core of triglycerides and cholesteryl
esters surrounded by phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins (Fig.
106.8). The density of the several classes of lipoproteins is inversely
proportional to the ratio of lipid to protein, which is generally denser
(Fig. 106.9).

of the vessel lumen by clot formation.

verse cholesterol pathways. The exogenous pathway transports dietary fat from the small intestine
as chylomicrons to the periphery and the liver. The
endogenous pathway denotes the secretion of very
low-­density lipoprotein (VLDL) from the liver and its
catabolism to intermediate-­density lipoprotein (IDL)
and low-­density lipoprotein (LDL). Triglycerides are
hydrolyzed from the VLDL particle by the action of
lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the vascular bed, yielding
free fatty acids (FFAs) for utilization and storage in
muscle and adipose tissue. High-­density lipoprotein
(HDL) metabolism is responsible for the transport of
excess cholesterol from the peripheral tissues back
to the liver for excretion in the bile. Nascent HDL-­3
particles derived from the liver and small intestine are
esterified to more mature HDL-­2 particles by enzyme-­
mediated movement of chylomicron and VLDL into
the HDL core, which is removed from the circulation
by endocytosis.

Constituent proteins known as apolipoproteins are responsible for
a variety of metabolic functions in addition to their structural role,
including as cofactors or inhibitors of enzymatic pathways and mediators of lipoprotein binding to cell surface receptors (Table 106.6).
ApoA is the major apolipoprotein (Apo) of HDL. ApoB is present in
LDL, VLDL, IDL, and chylomicrons. ApoB-­100 is derived from the
liver, whereas apoB-­48 comes from the small intestine. ApoC-­I, C-­II,
and C-­III are small peptides important in triglyceride metabolism.
Loss of function and disruptive pathogenic variants of the APOC3
gene are associated with low levels of triglycerides and a reduced risk
of ischemic CHD. Likewise, apoE, which is present in VLDL, HDL,
chylomicrons, and chylomicron remnants, plays an important role in
the clearance of triglycerides.

Transport of Exogenous (Dietary) Lipids

apoB-­48 in the intestinal mucosa to form chylomicrons, which are
carried into the peripheral circulation via the lymphatic system. HDL
particles contribute apoC-­II to the chylomicrons, required for the activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the capillary endothelium of
adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue. Free fatty acids are oxidized,
esterified for storage as triglycerides, or released into the circulation
bound to albumin for transport to the liver. After hydrolysis of the triglyceride core from the chylomicron, apoC particles are recirculated
back to HDL. The subsequent contribution of apoE from HDL to the
remnant chylomicron facilitates binding of the particle to the hepatic
LDL receptor (LDL-­R). Within the hepatocyte, the chylomicron remnant may be incorporated into membranes, resecreted as lipoprotein

back into the circulation, or secreted as bile acids. Normally, all dietary
fat is disposed of within 8 hours after the last meal, an exception being
individuals with a disorder of chylomicron metabolism. Postprandial
hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Abnormal transport
of chylomicrons and their remnants may result in their absorption into
the blood vessel wall as foam cells, caused by the ingestion of cholesteryl esters by macrophages, the earliest stage in the development of
fatty streaks.

The formation and secretion of VLDL from the liver and its catabolism
to IDL and LDL particles describe the endogenous lipoprotein pathway. Fatty acids used in the hepatic formation of VLDL are derived
primarily by uptake from the circulation. VLDL appears to be transported from the liver as rapidly as it is synthesized, and it consists of
triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, and apoB-­100. Nascent
particles of VLDL secreted into the circulation combine with apoC and
apoE. The size of the VLDL particle is determined by the amount of
triglyceride present, progressively shrinking in size as triglyceride is
hydrolyzed by the action of LPL, yielding free fatty acids for utilization
or storage in muscle and adipose tissue. Hydrolysis of approximately
80% of the triglyceride present in VLDL particles produces IDL particles containing an equal amount of cholesterol and triglyceride. The
remaining remnant IDL is converted to LDL for delivery to peripheral
tissues or to the liver. ApoE is attached to the remnant IDL particle to
allow binding to the cell and subsequent incorporation into the lysosome. Individuals with a deficiency of either apoE2 or hepatic triglyceride lipase accumulate IDL in the plasma.
LDL particles account for approximately 70% of the plasma cholesterol in normal individuals. LDL receptors are present on the surfaces
of nearly all cells. Most LDL is taken up by the liver, and the rest is
transported to peripheral tissues such as the adrenal glands and gonads
for steroid synthesis. Dyslipidemia is greatly influenced by LDL-­R
activity. The efficiency with which VLDL is converted into LDL is also
important in lipid homeostasis. The normal newborn LDL level of 50
mg/dL is probably adequate for steroid synthesis throughout the life
cycle.

High-­Density Lipoprotein and Reverse Cholesterol
Transport

Because hepatic secretion of lipid particles into the bile is the only
mechanism by which cholesterol can be removed from the body, transport of excess cholesterol from the peripheral cells is a vitally important function of HDL. HDL is heavily laden with apoA-­I–containing
lipoproteins, which is nonatherogenic, in contrast to B lipoproteins.
Cholesterol-­poor nascent HDL particles secreted by the liver and small
intestine are esterified to more mature HDL-­2 particles by the action of
the enzyme lecithin-­cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which facilitates movement of chylomicrons and VLDL into the HDL core. HDL-­2
may transfer cholesteryl esters back to apoB lipoproteins mediated by

cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), or the cholesterol-­rich particle may be removed from the plasma by endocytosis, completing
reverse cholesterol transport. Low HDL may be genetic (deficiency of
apoA-­I) or secondary to increased plasma triglyceride.
LCAT deficiency results in diminished maturation of HDL particles, affecting their ability to do reverse cholesterol transport. This
reduces its protective effect on atherosclerosis. There are rare reports,
however, of less-­than-­expected severity of atherosclerosis despite low
HDL secondary to LCAT deficiency, suggesting that the relationship
may, for unknown reasons, be variable.

HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIAS
Hypercholesterolemia
See Table 106.7.

Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic autosomal dominant disorder characterized by strikingly elevated LDL cholesterol
(LDL-­C), premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), and tendon xanthomas. It is predominantly associated with defects of LDL-­R activity but also includes defects in the genes for apoB (APOB) and the
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-­
9), a protein
important in LDL endocytosis. Of the almost 1,200 LDLR pathogenic
variants described, some result in failure of synthesis of the LDL-­R
(receptor negative) and others cause defective binding or release at the
lipoprotein-­receptor interface. Receptor-­negative pathogenic variants
result in more severe phenotypes than receptor-­defective pathogenic
variants. Data from the Netherlands has confirmed the importance
of LDL reduction in FH; the major adverse coronary event risk for
affected siblings with statin treatment begun at age 10 years mirrored
that of unaffected siblings rather than the risk profile of the affected
parent.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

FH homozygotes inherit two abnormal LDL receptor genes, resulting
in markedly elevated plasma cholesterol levels ranging between 500
and 1,200 mg/dL. Triglyceride levels are normal to mildly elevated, and
HDL levels may be slightly decreased. The condition occurs in 1 in
500,000 persons. Receptor-­negative patients have <2% normal LDL-­R
activity, whereas those who are receptor defective may have as much as
25% normal activity and consequently a better prognosis.
However, the prognosis is poor regardless of the specific LDL-­R
aberration. Severe atherosclerosis involving the aortic root and coronary arteries is present by early to middle childhood. These children
usually present with xanthomas, which may cause thickening of the
Achilles tendon or extensor tendons of the hands, or cutaneous lesions
on the hands, elbows, knees, or buttocks (Figs. 106.10-­106.12). Corneal
arcus may be present. Family history is informative because premature heart disease is strongly prevalent among relatives of both parents.
The diagnosis may be confirmed genetically or by measuring LDL-­R

circulation is recommended for many children because it slows the
progression of atherosclerosis. Liver transplantation is also successful
in decreasing LDL-­C levels, but complications related to immunosuppression are common. HMG-­CoA reductase inhibitors may be modestly effective depending on the specific class of LDL-­R defect present.
Combination therapy with ezetimibe, selectively blocking cholesterol
adsorption in the gut, usually results in further decline in LDL levels and has replaced the use of bile acid sequestrants. Clinical trials
using microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibition with lomitapide (an oral agent) resulted in significant reduction of all apoB
lipoproteins, including LDL, but hepatic fat deposition as a side effect
limits this pharmacologic approach. Mipomersen (subcutaneous injection), an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to the apolipoprotein B
mRNA, reduces the synthesis of apoB and thus also VLDL and LDL.
LDL cholesterol levels may decline approximately 25% with this treatment. Adverse effects include flulike symptoms, hepatic steatosis, and
cirrhosis.

Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

Heterozygous FH is the most common single-­gene disorder associated
with acute coronary syndromes and atherosclerotic CHD in adults. Its
prevalence is approximately 1 in 250 individuals worldwide, but the
frequency may be greater in select populations, such as French Canadians, Afrikaners, Ashkenazi Jews, and Christian Lebanese, as a result
of the founder effect of unique pathogenic variants. Heart disease
accounts for more than half of all deaths in Western society, with the
pathogenesis having both environmental and genetic influences.
Because heterozygous FH is a dominant condition with nearly full
penetrance, 50% of first-­degree relatives of affected individuals will
have the disease, as will 25% of second-­degree relatives. An estimated
20 million people have FH worldwide. Symptoms of CHD usually
occur at the mean age of 45-­48 years in males and a decade later in
females. Genetic testing of both adult and pediatric patients who fulfill
clinical diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of heterozygous FH is variably positive dependent on the population under investigation.
One cannot overemphasize the importance of family history for suspecting the possibility of FH, especially given the low rate of cholesterol
screening for children in primary care offices. Because the risk of CHD
in individuals with FH can be up to 20 times greater than in the general population, guidelines have advocated for universal screening for
cholesterol in childhood. There is also an interest in genetic testing for
persons with suspected FH because of variability in phenotype based
on genotype.
Plasma levels of LDL-­C also do not allow unequivocal diagnosis of
FH heterozygotes; values are generally twice normal for age because
of one absent or dysfunctional allele. The U.S. MED-­PED (Make Early
Diagnosis–Prevent Early Death) Program has formulated diagnostic
criteria.
Similar criteria with minor variations exist in the United Kingdom
(Simon Broome criteria) and Holland (Dutch Lipid Clinic Network
criteria). Within well-­defined FH families, the diagnosis is reliably
established according to LDL cutoff points. More stringent criteria are
required to establish the diagnosis in previously undiagnosed families,
requiring strong evidence of an autosomal inheritance pattern and
higher LDL cutoff points. At a total cholesterol level of 310 mg/dL, only
4% of adults in the general population would have FH, whereas 95% of
adults who were first-­degree relatives of known cases would have the
disease.
Very high cholesterol levels in children should prompt extensive
screening of adult first-­and second-­degree relatives (“reverse cascade”
cholesterol screening). In the general population, a child younger than
age 18 years with total plasma cholesterol of 270 mg/dL and/or LDL-­C
of 200 mg/dL has an 88% chance of having FH (Table 106.8). Formal
clinical diagnosis of FH is based on the presence of two or more family
members having elevated LDL-­C levels (the 95th percentile LDL-­C level
cutoff points for children vary with age and are lower than for adults;
Table 106.9). The criteria for probable FH in a child whose first-­degree
relative has known FH require only modest elevation of total cholesterol to 220 mg/dL (LDL-­C 160 mg/dL; see Table 106.8). The challenge

of childhood FH diagnosis is heightened by the lack of clinical stigmata
such as xanthomata that are employed in the Simon Broome and Dutch
Lipid Clinic Network schema and highlights the needed shift toward
genetic diagnosis.
Treatment of children with FH should begin with a rigorous low-­
fat diet. Diet alone is rarely sufficient for decreasing blood cholesterol
levels to acceptable levels (LDL-­C <130 mg/dL). Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol adsorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and has a low risk
of side effects. Data suggest that ezetimibe will lower total cholesterol
by 20-­30 mg/dL. HMG-­CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the drug of
choice for treatment of FH because of their remarkable effectiveness and
acceptable risk profile. This class of drugs in children over age 10 years
is as effective in children as in adults, and the risks of elevated hepatic
enzymes and myositis are no greater than in adults. Another class of
drugs, the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-­9)
inhibitors, are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block the action of
PCSK-­9 to downregulate the LDL-­R. These agents boost LDL-­R levels and result in a marked decrease in plasma LDL-­C levels. PCSK-­9
inhibitors have a role in adults intolerant of statins and those with subtherapeutic statin effect. Use of evolocumab in children over age 10 is
FDA approved. In addition, tobacco avoidance and cessation of use of
tobacco in the family should be stressed from the time of diagnosis.

Familial Defective ApoB-­100

Familial defective apoB-­
100 is an autosomal dominant condition
indistinguishable from heterozygous LDLR FH. LDL cholesterol levels are increased, triglycerides are normal, adults often develop tendon
xanthomas, and premature CHD occurs. Familial defective apoB-­100
is caused by a pathogenic variant in the receptor-­binding region of
apoB-­100, the ligand of the LDL receptor, with an estimated frequency
of 1 in 700 people in Western cultures. It is usually caused by missense substitution of apoB-­100 (p.Arg3527Gln, previously numbered
p.Arg3500Gln), which results in reduced ability of the LDL-­R to bind
LDL-­C, thus impairing its removal from the circulation. Specialized
laboratory testing can distinguish familial defective apoB-­100 from
FH, but this is not necessary, except in research settings, because treatment is the same.

Autosomal Recessive Hypercholesterolemia

This rare condition, caused by a defect in LDL-­R–mediated endocytosis in the liver, clinically presents with severe hypercholesterolemia at
levels intermediate between those found in homozygous and heterozygous FH. It is disproportionately present among Sardinians, reported
in other Mediterranean populations, and is modestly responsive to
treatment with HMG-­CoA reductase inhibitors.

Sitosterolemia

A rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by excessive intestinal adsorption of plant sterols, sitosterolemia is caused by pathogenic
variants in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding cassette transporter system (ABCG5 or ABCG8), which is responsible for limiting
adsorption of plant sterols in the small intestine and promotes biliary
excretion of the small amounts adsorbed. Plasma cholesterol levels
may be severely elevated, resulting in tendon xanthomas and premature atherosclerosis. Other features include hemolytic anemia, macrothrombocytopenia (large platelets, reduced number), and hemorrhage.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring elevated plasma sitosterol
levels. Treatment with HMG-­CoA reductase inhibitors is not effective,
but cholesterol adsorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, and bile acid
sequestrants are effective.

Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia

Primary elevation in LDL-­C among children and adults is most often
polygenic; the small effects of many genes are affected by environmental influences (diet). Plasma cholesterol levels are modestly elevated;
triglyceride levels are normal. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia aggregates in families sharing a common lifestyle but does not follow predictable hereditary patterns found in single-­gene lipoprotein defects.
Treatment of children with polygenic hypercholesterolemia is directed

toward adoption of a healthy lifestyle: reduced total and saturated fat
consumption and at least 1 hour of physical activity daily. Cholesterol-­
lowering medication is rarely necessary.

Hypercholesterolemia with Hypertriglyceridemia
Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia

This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by moderate elevation in plasma LDL-­C and triglycerides and reduced plasma HDL-­
C. Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is the most common
primary lipid disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 200 people. Family history of premature heart disease is typically positive; the formal
diagnosis requires that at least two first-­degree relatives have evidence
of one of three variants of dyslipidemia: (1) >90th percentile plasma
LDL-­C, (2) >90th percentile LDL-­C and triglycerides, and (3) >90th
percentile triglycerides. Individuals can switch from one phenotype to
another. Xanthomas are not a feature of FCHL. Elevated plasma apoB
levels with increased small, dense LDL particles support the diagnosis.
Children and adults with FCHL have coexisting adiposity, hypertension, and hyperinsulinemia, suggesting the presence of metabolic
syndrome. Formal diagnosis in adults, as defined by the National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III,
identifies six major components: abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance with or without impaired
glucose tolerance, evidence of vascular inflammation, and prothrombotic state. An estimated 30% of overweight adults fulfill criteria for the
diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, including 65% of those with FCHL.
There is no official definition of metabolic syndrome for children. Absolute cutoffs for diagnosis in children do not account for continuous
variables in aging, sexual maturation, and race/ethnicity.
FCHL and type 2 diabetes share many features of metabolic syndrome, suggesting that they are less distinct entities than originally
conceptualized. Genetic association studies reveal evidence for a common genetic background. The resultant metabolic overlap is associated
with ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance. The mechanisms
associating visceral adiposity with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are not fully understood. It is assumed that hypercholesterolemia

and, with less certainty, hypertriglyceridemia confer risk for CVD
in patients with FCHL. When features of metabolic syndrome are
included in logistic models, shared etiologic features such as increased
visceral adiposity become apparent. Visceral adiposity increases with
age, and its importance in children as a risk factor for heart disease
and diabetes is limited by the relative paucity of data. Body mass index
(BMI) remains the surrogate for adiposity in the pediatric clinical
setting.
The cornerstone of management is lifestyle modification. This includes
a diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol, as well as reduced
consumption of processed sugars. Increased dietary intake of fruits
and vegetables is important, as is 1 hour of moderate physical activity
daily. Compliance among children and their parents is often a problem,
but small incremental steps are more likely to succeed than aggressive
weight loss strategies. It is very important that the child’s caregivers
participate in the process. Plasma triglyceride levels are usually quite
responsive to dietary restriction, especially reduction in the amount
of sweetened drinks consumed. Blood cholesterol levels may decrease
by 10–15%, but if LDL-­C remains >160 mg/dL, drug therapy should
be considered.

Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia)

Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FDBL) is caused by pathogenic variants in APOE, which, when exposed to environmental influences (e.g.,
high-­fat high-­caloric diet, excessive alcohol intake), results in a mixed
type of hyperlipidemia. Patients tend to have elevated plasma cholesterol and triglycerides to a relatively similar degree. HDL-­C is typically
normal, in contrast to other causes of hypertriglyceridemia associated
with low HDL. This rare disorder affects approximately 1 in 10,000
persons. ApoE mediates removal of chylomicron and VLDL remnants
from the circulation by binding to hepatic surface receptors. The polymorphic APOE gene expresses in three isoforms: apoE3, apoE2, and
apoE4. E4 is the “normal” allele present in the majority of the population. The apoE2 isoform has lower affinity for the LDL receptor, and its
frequency is approximately 7%. Approximately 1% of the population is

homozygous for apoE2/E2, the most common pathogenic variant associated with FDBL, but only a minority expresses the disease. Expression requires precipitating illnesses such as diabetes, obesity, renal
disease, or hypothyroidism. Individuals homozygous for apoE4/E4 are
at risk for late-­onset Alzheimer disease and dementia from repeated
sports-­related head injuries.
Most patients with FDBL present in adulthood with distinctive xanthomas. Tuberoeruptive xanthomas resemble small, grapelike clusters
on the knees, buttocks, and elbows. Prominent orange-­yellow discoloration of the creases of the hands (palmar xanthomas) is also typically
present. Atherosclerosis, often presenting with peripheral vascular disease, usually occurs in the fourth or fifth decade. Children may present
with a less distinctive rash and generally have precipitating illnesses.
The diagnosis of FDBL is established by lipoprotein electrophoresis, which demonstrates a broad beta band containing remnant lipoproteins. Direct measurement of VLDL by ultracentrifugation can be
performed in specialized lipid laboratories. A VLDL/total triglyceride
ratio >0.30 supports the diagnosis. APOE genotyping for apoE2 homozygosity can be performed, confirming the diagnosis in the presence of
the distinctive physical findings. A negative result does not necessarily
rule out the disease, as other pathogenic variants in APOE may cause
even more serious manifestations.
Pharmacologic treatment of FDBL is necessary to decrease the likelihood of symptomatic atherosclerosis in adults. HMG-­CoA reductase
inhibitors, nicotinic acid, and fibrates are all effective. FDBL is quite
responsive to recommended dietary restriction.

Hypertriglyceridemias

The familial disorders of triglyceride-­rich lipoproteins include both
common and rare variants of the Frederickson classification system.
These include familial chylomicronemia (type I), familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV), and the more severe combined hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia (type V). Hepatic lipase deficiency also
results in a similar combined hyperlipidemia.

Familial Chylomicronemia (Type I Hyperlipidemia)

This rare single-­gene defect, like FH, is caused by pathogenic variants affecting clearance of apoB-­
containing lipoproteins. A deficiency or absence of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or its cofactor apoC-­II
(APOC2), which facilitates lipolysis by LPL, causes severe elevation of
triglyceride-­rich plasma chylomicrons. HDL-­C levels are decreased.
Clearance of these particles is greatly delayed, so the plasma is noted
to have a turbid appearance even after prolonged fasting (Fig. 106.13).
Chylomicronemia caused by LPL deficiency is associated with modest
elevation in triglycerides, whereas this is not the case when the cause
is deficient or absent apoC-­II. Both are autosomal recessive conditions
with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1 million. The disease usually
presents during childhood with acute pancreatitis. Eruptive xanthomas
on the arms, knees, and buttocks may be present, and there may be
hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis is established by assaying triglyceride lipolytic activity. Treatment of chylomicronemia is by vigorous
dietary fat restriction supplemented by fat-­soluble vitamins. Medium-­
chain triglycerides that are adsorbed into the portal venous system may
augment total fat intake, and administration of fish oils may also be
beneficial.

Familial Hypertriglyceridemia (Type IV
Hyperlipidemia)

Familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG) is an autosomal dominant disorder of unknown etiology that occurs in approximately 1 in 500 individuals. It is characterized by elevation of plasma triglycerides >90th
percentile (250-­
1,000 mg/dL range), often accompanied by slight
elevation in plasma cholesterol and low HDL. FHTG does not usually
manifest until adulthood, although it can be detected in approximately
20% of affected children. In contrast to FCHL, FHTG is not thought to
be highly atherogenic. It is most likely caused by defective breakdown
of VLDL or, less often, by overproduction of this class of lipoproteins.
The diagnosis should include the presence of at least one first-­degree
relative with hypertriglyceridemia. FHTG should be distinguished

Fig. 106.13 Milky plasma from a patient with acute abdominal pain.
(From Durrington P. Dyslipidaemia, Lancet. 2003;362:717–731.)

from FCHL and FDBL, which require more vigorous treatment to
prevent coronary or peripheral vascular disease. The differentiation is
usually possible on clinical grounds, in that lower LDL-­C levels accompany FHTG, but measurement of normal apoB levels in FHTG may be
helpful in ambiguous situations.
A more severe hypertriglyceridemia characterized by increased levels of chylomicrons and VLDL particles (Frederickson type V) may
occasionally be encountered. Triglyceride levels are often >1,000 mg/
dL. The disease is rarely seen in children. In contrast to chylomicronemia (Frederickson type I), LPL or apoC-­II deficiency is not present. These patients often develop eruptive xanthomas in adulthood,
whereas type IV hypertriglyceridemia individuals do not. Acute
pancreatitis may be the presenting illness. As with other hypertriglyceridemias, excessive alcohol consumption and estrogen therapy can
exacerbate the disease.
Secondary causes of transient hypertriglyceridemia should be ruled
out before making a diagnosis of FHTG. A diet high in simple sugars and carbohydrates or excessive alcohol consumption, as well as
estrogen therapy, may exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia. Adolescents
and adults should be questioned about excessive consumption of soda
and other sweetened drinks, as it is common to encounter people who
drink supersized drinks or multiple 12 oz cans of sweetened drinks
daily. Cessation of this practice often results in a dramatic fall in triglyceride levels and weight among those who are obese. HDL-­C levels
will tend to rise as BMI stabilizes.
Pediatric diseases associated with hyperlipidemia include hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, biliary atresia, glycogen storage disease,
Niemann-­Pick disease (NPD), Tay-­Sachs disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis, and anorexia nervosa (Table 106.10). Certain
medications exacerbate hyperlipidemia, including isotretinoin (Accutane), thiazide diuretics, second-­generation antipsychotic agents, oral
contraceptives, corticosteroids, β blockers, immunosuppressants, and
protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment.
Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in children rarely requires medication unless levels >1,000 mg/dL persist after dietary restriction of fats,

In such patients the aim is to prevent episodes of pancreatitis. The common use of fibrates (fenofibric acid) and niacin in adults with hypertriglyceridemia is not recommended in children. HMG-­CoA reductase
inhibitors are variably effective in lowering triglyceride levels, and
there is considerably more experience documenting the safety and efficacy of this class of lipid-­lowering medications in children. In adults,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved prescription (Lovaza, Vascepa) and nonprescription fish oils as adjuncts to diet
in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemias.

Hepatic Lipase Deficiency

Hepatic lipase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive condition
caused by pathogenic variants in LMF1 resulting in elevation in both
plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Hepatic lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides and phospholipids in VLDL remnants and IDL, preventing
their conversion to LDL. HDL-­C levels tend to be increased rather
than decreased, suggesting the diagnosis. Laboratory confirmation
is established by measuring hepatic lipase activity in heparinized
plasma.

Disorders of High-­Density Lipoprotein Metabolism
Primary Hypoalphalipoproteinemia

Isolated low HDL-­C is a familial condition that often follows a pattern
suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance but may occur independent of family history. It is the most common disorder of HDL metabolism. It is defined as HDL-­C <10th percentile for gender and age with
normal plasma triglycerides and LDL-­C. Whether it is associated with
more rapid atherosclerosis is uncertain. Primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia appears to be related to a reduction in apoA-­I synthesis and
increased catabolism of HDL. Secondary causes of low HDL-­C, such
as metabolic syndrome, and rare diseases such as LCAT deficiency and
Tangier disease must be ruled out.

Familial Hyperalphalipoproteinemia

This is an unusual condition conferring decreased risk for CHD among
family members. Plasma levels of HDL-­C exceed 80 mg/dL.

Familial Apolipoprotein A-­I Deficiency

Pathogenic variants in the APOA1 gene may result in complete absence
of plasma HDL. Nascent HDL is produced in the liver and small
intestine. Free cholesterol from peripheral cells is esterified by LCAT,
enabling formation of mature HDL particles. ApoA-­I is required for
normal enzymatic functioning of LCAT. The resultant accumulation of
free cholesterol in the circulation eventually leads to corneal opacities,
planar xanthomas, and premature atherosclerosis. Some patients, however, may have pathogenic variants of APOA1 that result in very rapid
catabolism of the protein not associated with atherogenesis, despite
HDL-­C levels in the 15-­30 mg/dL range.

Tangier Disease

This autosomal dominant disease is associated with HDL-­C levels <5
mg/dL. It is caused by pathogenic variants in ABCA1, which encodes
a protein that facilitates the binding of cellular cholesterol to apoA-­I.
This results in free cholesterol accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, manifested by tonsillar hypertrophy of a distinctive orange
color and hepatosplenomegaly. Intermittent peripheral neuropathy
may occur from cholesterol accumulation in Schwann cells. Diagnosis should be suspected in children with enlarged orange tonsils and
extremely low HDL-­C levels.

Familial Lecithin–Cholesterol Acyltransferase
Deficiency

Pathogenic variants of LCAT interfere with the esterification of cholesterol, thereby preventing formation of mature HDL particles. This
is associated with rapid catabolism of apoA-­I. Free circulating cholesterol in the plasma is greatly increased, which leads to corneal opacities
and HDL-­C levels <10 mg/dL. Partial LCAT deficiency is known as
“fish-­eye” disease because of the corneal opacities. Complete deficiency
causes hemolytic anemia and progressive renal insufficiency early in
adulthood. This rare disease is not thought to cause premature atherosclerosis. Laboratory confirmation is based on a demonstration of
decreased cholesterol esterification in the plasma.

Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Deficiency

Pathogenic variants of the CETP gene result in cholesteryl ester transfer
protein (CETP) deficiency. CETP facilitates the transfer of lipoproteins
from mature HDL to and from VLDL and chylomicron particles, thus
ultimately regulating the rate of cholesterol transport to the liver for
excretion in the bile. About half of mature HDL-­2 particles are directly
removed from the circulation by HDL receptors on the surface of the
liver. The other half of cholesteryl esters in the core of HDL exchange
with triglycerides in the core of apoB lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, LDL)
for transport to the liver. Homozygous deficiency of CETP has been
observed in subsets of the Japanese population with extremely high
HDL-­C levels (>150 mg/dL).

Conditions Associated with Low Cholesterol

Disorders of apoB-­containing lipoproteins and intracellular cholesterol
metabolism are associated with low plasma cholesterol.

Abetalipoproteinemia

This rare autosomal recessive disease is caused by pathogenic variants
in the MTTP gene that encodes the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein necessary for the transfer of lipids to nascent chylomicrons in the small intestine and VLDL in the liver. This results in an
absence of chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, and apoB and very low levels
of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Fat and fat-­soluble vitamin
malabsorption, diarrhea, and failure to thrive present in early childhood. Spinocerebellar degeneration, secondary to vitamin E deficiency, manifests in loss of deep tendon reflexes progressing to ataxia
and lower-­extremity spasticity by adulthood. Patients with abetalipoproteinemia also acquire a progressive pigmented retinopathy associated with decreased night and color vision and eventual blindness. The
neurologic symptoms and retinopathy may be mistaken for Friedreich
ataxia. Differentiation from Friedreich ataxia is suggested by the presence of malabsorption and acanthocytosis on peripheral blood smear

Chapter 106 u Defects in Metabolism of Lipids
in abetalipoproteinemia. Many of the clinical manifestations of the disease are a result of malabsorption of fat-­soluble vitamins, such as vitamins E, A, and K. Early treatment with supplemental vitamins, especially
E, may significantly slow the development of neurologic sequelae. Vitamin E is normally transported from the small intestine to the liver by
chylomicrons, where it is dependent on the endogenous VLDL pathway for delivery into the circulation and peripheral tissues. Parents of
children with abetalipoproteinemia have normal blood lipid and apoB
levels.

Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia

Familial homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia is associated with
symptoms very similar to those of abetalipoproteinemia, but the inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant caused by pathogenic variants in
APOB. It is distinguishable from abetalipoproteinemia in that heterozygous parents of probands have plasma LDL-­C and apoB levels less
than half of normal. However, few symptoms or sequelae are associated
with the heterozygous condition.
The selective inability to secrete apoB-­48 from the small intestine
results in a condition resembling abetalipoproteinemia or homozygous
hypobetalipoproteinemia. Sometimes referred to as Anderson disease
or chylomicron retention disease, caused by recessive alterations of
the SAR1B gene, the failure of chylomicron absorption causes steatorrhea and fat-­soluble vitamin deficiency. The blood level of apoB-­100,
derived from normal hepatocyte secretion, is normal in this condition.

Smith-­Lemli-­Opitz Syndrome

Smith-­Lemli-­Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that includes microcephaly, polydactyly, holoprosencephaly,
seizures and developmental delay. Phenotypic variance ranges from
microcephaly, cardiac and brain malformation, and multiorgan system failure to only subtle dysmorphic features and mild developmental delay. It is associated with low plasma cholesterol and accumulated
precursors (Tables 106.11 and 106.12) (see Chapter 628.2). Pathogenic
variants in the DHCR7 (7-­dehydrocholesterol-­Δ7 reductase) gene
result in deficiency of the microsomal enzyme DHCR7, which is necessary to complete the final step in cholesterol synthesis. Hypotheses
to connect the role of cholesterol synthesis in SLOS congenital malformations have implicated the ligand sonic hedgehog (SHH), for which
developmental signaling activity is dependent on cholesterol modification. The incidence of SLOS is estimated to be 1 in 20,000-­60,000
births.
Spontaneous abortion of SLOS fetuses may occur. Type II SLOS often
leads to death by the end of the neonatal period. Survival is unlikely
when the plasma cholesterol level is <20 mg/dL. Laboratory measurement should be performed by gas chromatography, because standard
techniques for lipoprotein assay include measurement of cholesterol
precursors, which may yield a false-­positive result. Milder cases may not
present until late childhood. Treatment includes supplemental dietary
cholesterol (egg yolk) and HMG-­CoA reductase inhibition to prevent
the synthesis of toxic precursors proximal to the enzymatic block.

Disorders of Intracellular Cholesterol Metabolism
Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis

This autosomal recessive disorder presents in late adolescence with
tendon xanthomas, cataracts, and progressive neurodegeneration. It
is caused by tissue accumulation of bile acid intermediates that are
shunted into production of cholestanol that in turn result from pathogenic variants in the gene for sterol 27-­hydroxylase (CYP27A1). This
enzyme is necessary for normal mitochondrial synthesis of bile acids
in the liver. Early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid reduces cholesterol levels and prevents the development of symptoms.

Wolman Disease and Cholesterol Ester Storage
Disease

These autosomal recessive disorders are caused by pathogenic variants
in LIPA that result in lack of lysosomal acid lipase. After LDL cholesterol is incorporated into the cell by endocytosis, it is delivered to lysosomes, where it is hydrolyzed by lysosomal lipase. Failure of hydrolysis

because of complete absence of the enzyme causes accumulation of
cholesteryl esters within the cells. Hepatosplenomegaly, steatorrhea,
and failure to thrive occur during early infancy, leading to death by the
end of the first year. In cholesterol ester storage disease, a less severe
form than Wolman disease, there is low but detectable acid lipase activity (see Chapter 106.4).

Niemann-­Pick Disease Type C

This disorder of intracellular cholesterol transport is characterized by
accumulation of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the CNS and reticuloendothelial system. Death from this autosomal recessive neurologic
disease usually occurs by adolescence (see Chapter 106.4).

Lipoprotein Patterns in Children and Adolescents

Derived primarily from the Lipid Research Clinics Population Studies, Table 106.9 shows the distribution of lipoprotein levels in American youth at various ages. Total plasma cholesterol rises rapidly from
a mean of 68 mg/dL at birth to a level approximately twice that by the
end of the neonatal period. A very gradual rise in total cholesterol level
occurs until puberty, when the mean level reaches 160 mg/dL. Total
cholesterol falls transiently during puberty in males because of a small
decrease in HDL-­C and in females secondary to a slight fall in LDL-­C.
Blood cholesterol levels track reasonably well as individuals age.
High blood cholesterol tends to aggregate in families, a reflection of
genetic and environmental influences.
Acceptable total cholesterol among children and adolescents is <170
mg/dL; borderline is 170-­199 mg/dL; and high is >200 mg/dL. Acceptable LDL-­C is <110 mg/dL; borderline is 110-­129 mg/dL; and high is
>130 mg/dL. HDL-­C should be >40 mg/dL.

Blood Cholesterol Screening

A lipid profile should be checked for all children between ages 9 and 11
years and then another between ages 17 and 21 years because cholesterol levels may vary after puberty. However, if a child would have met
the selective criteria from the previous risk-­based guidelines (premature coronary artery disease [CAD] in a parent or grandparent, a parent with cholesterol >240 mg/dL), screening can occur as early as age 2

years. Data also suggest that obtaining a nonfasting lipid profile can be
just as useful in detecting severe genetic dyslipidemias as a fasting lipid
profile and thus can be used as first-­line screening in children. Fasting
lipid profiles may also be used depending on parental, child, and clinician preference, especially if there is concern for hypertriglyceridemia,
because triglycerides are affected more by fasting status. Abnormal
lipid panels should be repeated, and especially when the concern is the
triglycerides, the second panel should be obtained ≥2 weeks later in the
fasted state. Treatment other than lifestyle modification is not initiated
based on a single lipid panel determination.

Risk Assessment and Treatment of Hyperlipidemia

The NCEP recommends a population-­based approach toward a healthy
lifestyle applicable to all children and an individualized approach
directed at those children at high risk (Fig. 106.14). The important
focus on maintenance of a healthy lifestyle rather than aggressive
weight reduction is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).
All children with dyslipidemias are stratified according to the presence of high-­level or moderate-­level risk factors to determine their ultimate treatment. High-­level risk factors are defined as hypertension
requiring drug therapy (blood pressure ≥99th percentile + 5 mm Hg),
current cigarette smoker, BMI at the ≥97th percentile, the presence of
type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, postorthoptic heart transplant, and/or Kawasaki disease with current aneurysms.
Moderate-­level risk factors are defined as hypertension that does not
require drug therapy, BMI at the ≥95th percentile but <97th percentile, HDL-­C <40 mg/dL, Kawasaki disease (and possibly multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-­C]) with regressed coronary
aneurysms, chronic inflammatory disease, HIV infection, and/or the
presence of nephrotic syndrome.

The initial treatment for dyslipidemia in a child always begins with a
6-­month trial of lifestyle modification, namely, improvements in dietary
and physical activity patterns. Being overweight confers a special risk
of CVD because of the strong association with insulin resistance syndrome (metabolic syndrome). Although there is no standardized
definition of metabolic syndrome for youth, it is likely that half of all
severely obese children are insulin resistant. Data from the CARDIAC
project noted that 49% of fifth-­grade children with the hyperpigmented
rash, acanthosis nigricans, had three or more factors for insulin resistance syndrome when using the definition classically used for adults,
including evidence of insulin resistance, hypertension, HDL-­C <40
mg/dL, and triglycerides >150 mg/dL, in addition to obesity.
The Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet-­1 (CHILD-­1)
diet is the first level of dietary change to be recommended for all children with dyslipidemias. The CHILD-­1 diet is specially designed for
children with risk factors for CAD and focuses on limiting dietary
cholesterol to 300 mg/day, limiting sugary drink consumption, using
reduced-­fat/skim milk, avoiding foods high in trans-­type fats, limiting foods high in sodium, and encouraging consumption of foods high
in fiber. Specific recommendations depend on the child’s age. American Heart Association (AHA) diet guidelines for all persons of all ages
recommend these measures plus avoidance of highly processed foods.
Specific amounts or percentages of saturated vs monosaturated or
polyunsaturated fats are not addressed.
The use of the Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet-­2
(CHILD-­2) diet is recommended if the CHILD-­1 diet alone is unsuccessful. Although similar in many aspects to the CHILD-­1 diet, the
CHILD-­
2 diet is geared toward a specific dyslipidemia type; the
CHILD-­2 LDL diet is recommended for children with elevated LDL
levels and the CHILD-­2 TG diet for those presenting with elevated triglycerides. The basic recommendations of calorie consumption for the
CHILD-­2 diet are as follows: only 25–30% of calories from fat, ≤7% of
calories from saturated fat, 10% of calories from monounsaturated fat,
and <200 mg/day of cholesterol. If the CHILD-­2 LDL diet is recommended, the use of plant sterols and water-­soluble fiber is emphasized.
If the CHILD-­2 TG diet is recommended, increasing consumption of
omega-­3 fatty acids and complex rather than simple carbohydrates is
emphasized.
If followed, these dietary recommendations will provide adequate
calories for optimal growth and development without promoting obesity. Compliance on the part of children and their caregivers is challenging. Children learn eating habits from their parents. Successful
adoption of a healthier lifestyle is much more likely to occur if meals
and snacks in the home are applicable to the entire family rather than
an individual child. A regular time for meals together as a family is
desirable. Grandparents and other nonparental caregivers sometimes
need to be reminded not to indulge the child who is on a restricted diet.
Additionally, the rise in obesity is prompting some school districts to
restrict sweetened drink availability and offer more nutritious cafeteria
selections.
Changes in physical activity habits are also an important part of the
initial lifestyle modification. The National Association for Sport and
Physical Education recommends that children should accumulate at
least 60 minutes of age-­appropriate physical activity on most days of
the week. Extended periods (≥2 hr) of daytime inactivity are discouraged, as is >2 hours of television and other forms of screen time.
Pharmacologic Therapy. See Tables 106.13 and 106.14.
Pharmacologic therapy with cholesterol-­lowering medication is the
cornerstone of treatment for children who fail to respond to 6 months
of rigorous lifestyle modification. It should be considered when one of
the following conditions are met (also shown in Fig. 106.14):
• LDL cholesterol remains >190 mg/dL
• LDL cholesterol remains >160 mg/dL with the presence of one high-­
level risk factor and/or at least two moderate-­level risk factors
• LDL cholesterol remains >130 mg/dL with the presence of at least
two high-­level risk factors, one high-­level risk factor, and at least two
moderate-­level risk factors, or evidence of CAD
HMG-­
CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as “statins,” are
remarkably effective in lowering LDL-­C levels and reducing plaque

inflammation, thereby reducing the likelihood of a sudden coronary
event in an at-­risk adult within weeks of starting the medication. As
a class, they work by blocking the intrahepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol, thereby stimulating the production of more LDL receptors on the
cell surface and facilitating the uptake of LDL-­C from the bloodstream.
The NCEP Adult Treatment Panel advocates aggressive lowering of
LDL to <70 mg/dL in individuals with known CAD. This information is relevant because a child who fulfills criteria for consideration of

cholesterol-­lowering medication will almost always have inherited the
condition from one of the child’s parents. Not infrequently, when providing care for the child, questions arise about screening and treatment
of parents or grandparents. Statins are equally effective in children,
capable of lowering LDL-­C levels by 50% when necessary. They are
considered first-­line therapy for children who meet criteria for pharmacologic therapy. They also will effect a modest reduction in triglycerides and an inconsistent increase in HDL-­C. Their side effect profile,
mainly liver dysfunction and rarely rhabdomyolysis with secondary
renal failure, should be taken into consideration before prescribing
the drug. However, there has been no evidence that complications are
any more frequent in children than in adults, and skeletal muscle discomfort seems to be somewhat less of a problem. Drug interactions
may occur as well, so careful attention should be paid to a child’s active
prescriptions to avoid potentiation of the side effects. Children should
have liver enzymes monitored regularly and creatine phosphokinase
measured if muscle aches or weakness occurs. Liver (muscle) enzymes
may be allowed to rise threefold before discontinuing the drug. There
is a suggested link between the use of statins and increased risk of
developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, but these results have not
been replicated in children. Sex hormones have been measured in children receiving statins and are unchanged. It should be reemphasized
that children with modest elevations in cholesterol, such as that seen
in polygenic hypercholesterolemia, are not, as a rule, candidates for
statins because of their side effect profile and the childhood response to
lifestyle modifications. Statins should be started at the lowest effective
dose and allowed at least 8 weeks to achieve their peak effect. If LDL
levels are not at goal, which in children who are treated is generally
established to be <130 mg, the medication may be titrated upward with
careful monitoring of side effects.
Other cholesterol-­lowering medications, such as nicotinic acid and
fibrates, have been used far less often in children than bile acid sequestrants and statins. Nicotinic acid and fibrates have been used selectively
in children with marked hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) at risk for
acute pancreatitis, though dietary restriction of complex sugars (stressing elimination of sugar-­sweetened beverages) and carbohydrates will
usually result in significant lowering of triglyceride levels. Guidelines
recommend treatment of LDL-­C as the initial priority, and after LDL
levels are at goal, then if triglycerides remain between 200 and 499 mg/
dL and non-­HDL cholesterol ≥145 mg/dL, pharmacologic treatment
to reduce triglyceride levels is indicated. Omega-­3 fatty acid supplementation, available in both over-­the-­counter and prescription form,
is a safe and useful treatment thought to reduce triglyceride levels by
decreasing the hepatic synthesis of triglycerides. LDL-­C levels in adults

area will continue to evolve.
Ezetimibe has proved to be useful in the pediatric population because
of its efficacy and low side effect profile. Ezetimibe reduces plasma
LDL-­C by blocking sterol absorption in enterocytes. The drug is marketed as an adjunct to statins when adults are not achieving sufficient
blood lipid lowering with statins alone. Sufficient reports documenting
its effectiveness without side effects support recommending ezetimibe
instead of a statin when moderate hypercholesterolemia is encountered
or apprehension from parents makes using a statin difficult.

106.4 Lipidoses (Lysosomal Storage
Disorders)
Margaret M. McGovern and Robert J. Desnick
The lysosomal lipid storage diseases are diverse disorders each caused
by an inherited deficiency of a lysosomal hydrolase leading to the
intralysosomal accumulation of the enzyme’s particular substrate
(Tables 106.15 and 106.16). With the exceptions of Wolman disease
and cholesterol ester storage disease (see Chapter 106.3), the lipid
substrates share a common structure that includes a ceramide backbone (2-­N-­acylsphingosine) from which the various sphingolipids are
derived by substitution of hexoses, phosphorylcholine, or one or more

Chapter 106 u Defects in Metabolism of Lipids
sialic acid residues on the terminal hydroxyl group of the ceramide
molecule. The pathway of sphingolipid metabolism in nervous tissue
(Fig. 106.15) and in visceral organs (Fig. 106.16) is known. Each catabolic step, with the exception of the catabolism of lactosylceramide,
has a genetically determined metabolic defect and a resultant disease.
Because sphingolipids are essential components of all cell membranes,
the inability to degrade these substances and their subsequent accumulation results in the physiologic and morphologic alterations and
characteristic clinical manifestations of the lipid storage disorders (see
Tables 106.15 and 106.16). Progressive lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids in the CNS leads to neurodegeneration, whereas storage in visceral cells can lead to organomegaly, pulmonary infiltration,
skeletal abnormalities, and other manifestations.
Diagnostic assays for the identification of affected individuals has
relied on the measurement of the specific enzymatic activity in isolated
leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. An approach to
differentiating these disorders is noted in Figure 106.17. In addition,
next generation sequencing of lysosomal genes as well as metabolomic/
protomic approaches have helped determine a specific diagnosis. For
most disorders, carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis are available; a specific diagnosis is essential to permit genetic counseling. The
characterization of the genes that encode the specific enzymes required
for sphingolipid metabolism permit the development of therapeutic
options, such as recombinant enzyme replacement therapy, as well as
the potential of cell or gene therapy. Identification of specific disease-­
causing pathogenic variants improve diagnosis, prenatal detection,
and carrier identification. For several disorders (Gaucher, Fabry, and
NPD), it has been possible to make genotype-­phenotype correlations
that predict disease severity and allow more precise genetic counseling.
Inheritance is autosomal recessive except for X-­linked Fabry disease.

GM1 GANGLIOSIDOSIS

GM1 gangliosidosis most frequently presents in early infancy but has
been described in patients with juvenile-­and adult-­onset subtypes (Fig.
106.18, Table 106.17). Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, each
subtype results from a different gene pathogenic variant that leads to
the deficient activity of β-­galactosidase, a lysosomal enzyme encoded
by the gene GLB1. Although the disorder is characterized by the pathologic accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in the lysosomes of both neural
and visceral cells, GM1 ganglioside accumulation is most marked in the
brain. In addition, keratan sulfate, a mucopolysaccharide, accumulates
in liver and is excreted in the urine of patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.
The clinical manifestations of the infantile form of GM1 gangliosidosis may be evident in the newborn as hepatosplenomegaly, edema,
and skin eruptions (angiokeratoma). It most frequently presents in the
first 6 months of life with developmental delay followed by progressive
psychomotor retardation and the onset of tonic-­clonic seizures. Typical
facies is characterized by low-­set ears, frontal bossing, a depressed nasal
bridge, and an abnormally long philtrum. Up to 50% of patients have
a macular cherry red spot. Hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal abnormalities similar to those of the mucopolysaccharidoses (see Chapter
109), including anterior beaking of the vertebrae, enlargement of the
sella turcica, and thickening of the calvarium, are present. By the end
of the first year of life, most patients are blind and deaf, with severe neurologic impairment characterized by decerebrate rigidity. Death usually
occurs by 3-­4 years of age. The juvenile-­onset form of GM1 gangliosidosis
is clinically distinct, with a variable age at onset. Affected patients present primarily with neurologic symptoms including ataxia, dysarthria,
intellectual disabilities, and spasticity. Deterioration is slow; patients may
survive through the fourth decade of life. These patients lack the visceral
involvement, facial abnormalities, and skeletal features seen in type 1 disease. Adult-­onset patients have been described who present with gait and
speech abnormalities, dystonia, and mild skeletal abnormalities. There is
no specific treatment for any form of GM1 gangliosidosis.
The diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis should be suspected in infants
with typical clinical features and is confirmed by the demonstration of
biallelic pathogenic variants in GLB1 and, as needed, demonstration of
deficiency of β-­galactosidase activity in peripheral leukocytes. Other
disorders that share some of the features of the GM1 gangliosidoses

885

include Hurler disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type I), I-­cell disease,
and NPD type A, each of which can be distinguished by the demonstration of their specific genetic variants and enzymatic deficiencies. Carriers of the disorder are detected by the measurement of the enzymatic
activity in peripheral leukocytes or by identifying the specific gene
pathogenic variants. Prenatal diagnosis is accomplished by testing of
known pathogenic variants or by determination of the enzymatic activity in cultured amniocytes or chorionic villi. Currently only supportive
therapy is available for patients with GM1 gangliosidosis.

THE GM2 GANGLIOSIDOSES

The GM2 gangliosidoses include the autosomal recessive Tay-­Sachs
disease and Sandhoff disease. Each results from the deficiency of β-­
hexosaminidase activity and the lysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides, particularly in the CNS. Both disorders have been classified
into infantile-­, juvenile-­, and adult-­onset forms based on the age at
onset and clinical features. β-­Hexosaminidase occurs as two isozymes:
β-­hexosaminidase A, which is composed of one α and one β subunit,
and β-­hexosaminidase B, which has two β subunits. β-­Hexosaminidase
A deficiency results from pathogenic variants in the α subunit and
causes Tay-­Sachs disease, whereas pathogenic variants in the β-­subunit
gene result in the deficiency of both β-­hexosaminidases A and B and
cause Sandhoff disease. Both are autosomal recessive traits, with Tay-­
Sachs disease having a predilection for the Ashkenazi Jewish population, where the carrier frequency is about 1/25.
More than 100 pathogenic variants in HEXA have been identified
for Tay-­Sachs disease. Most are associated with the infantile forms of
disease. Three pathogenic variants account for >98% of mutant alleles
among Ashkenazi Jewish carriers, including one allele associated with
the adult-­onset form. Pathogenic variants that cause the subacute or
chronic forms result in enzyme proteins with residual enzymatic activities, the levels of which correlate with the severity of the disease.
Patients with the infantile form of Tay-­Sachs disease have clinical
manifestations in infancy including loss of motor skills, increased
startle reaction, and macular pallor and retinal cherry red spots (see
Table 106.15). Affected infants usually develop normally until 4-­5
months of age, when decreased eye contact and an exaggerated startle
response to noise (hyperacusis) are noted. Macrocephaly, not associated with hydrocephalus, may develop. In the second year of life,
seizures develop, which may be refractory to anticonvulsant therapy.
Neurodegeneration is relentless, with death occurring by the age
of 4 or 5 years. The juvenile-­and later-­onset forms initially present
with ataxia and dysarthria and may not be associated with a macular
cherry red spot.
The clinical manifestations of Sandhoff disease are similar to those
for Tay-­Sachs disease. Infants with Sandhoff disease have hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac involvement, and mild bony abnormalities. The juvenile
form of this disorder presents as ataxia, dysarthria, and intellectual
deterioration, but without visceral enlargement or a macular cherry red
spot. More than 50 pathogenic variants in HEXB have been identified
for Sandhoff disease.
The diagnosis of infantile Tay-­Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease is
usually suspected in an infant with neurologic features and a cherry red
spot. Definitive diagnosis is made by genetic testing or by determination of enzyme activities in peripheral leukocytes. The two disorders
can be distinguished enzymatically, because in Tay-­Sachs disease only
the β-­hexosaminidase A isozyme is deficient, whereas in Sandhoff disease both the β-­hexosaminidase A and B isozymes are deficient. At-­risk
pregnancies for both disorders can be prenatally diagnosed by testing
known pathogenic variants or determining enzyme levels in fetal cells
obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Identification
of carriers in families is also possible by genetic or enzymatic determination. For Tay-­Sachs disease, carrier screening of all couples in
which at least one member is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is recommended before the initiation of pregnancy to identify couples at risk.
The incidence of Tay-­Sachs disease has been markedly reduced since
the introduction of carrier screening programs in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population. Newborn screening may be possible by measuring specific
glycosphingolipid markers or the relevant enzymatic activities in dried

Sandhoff disease. The FDA has approved an investigational new drug
application to initiate adeno-associated virus vector gene (beta hexosaminidase A and B) therapy for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease.

GAUCHER DISEASE

This disease is a multisystemic lipidosis characterized by hematologic
abnormalities, organomegaly, and skeletal involvement, the latter usually manifesting as bone pain and pathologic fractures (see Table 106.15
and 106.16). It is the most common lysosomal storage disease and the
most prevalent genetic defect among Ashkenazi Jews. There are three
clinical subtypes delineated by the absence or presence and progression
of neurologic manifestations: type 1 or the adult, non-­neuronopathic
form; type 2, the infantile or acute neuronopathic form; and type 3, the
juvenile or subacute neuronopathic form. All are autosomal recessive
traits. Type 1, which accounts for 99% of cases, has a striking predilection for Ashkenazi Jews, with an incidence of about 1/1,000 and a carrier frequency of about 1/18.
Gaucher disease results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal
hydrolase, acid β-­glucosidase, which is encoded by the gene GBA. The
enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of undegraded glycolipid
substrates, particularly glucosylceramide, in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. This progressive deposition results in infiltration of the bone
marrow, progressive hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal complications.
Four pathogenic variants—p.Asn370Ser, p.Leu444Pro, c.84insG, and
IVS2+1G>A—account for about 95% of mutant alleles among Ashkenazi
Jewish patients, permitting screening for this disorder in this population. Genotype-­phenotype correlations have been noted, providing the

molecular basis for the clinical heterogeneity seen in Gaucher disease
type 1. Patients who are homozygous for the p.Asn370Ser pathogenic
variant tend to have a later onset, with a more indolent course than
patients with one copy of p.Asn370Ser and another common allele.
Clinical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease have a variable age at onset, from early childhood to late adulthood, with most
symptomatic patients presenting by adolescence. At presentation,
patients may have bruising from thrombocytopenia, chronic fatigue
secondary to anemia, hepatomegaly with or without elevated LFT
results, splenomegaly, and bone pain. Occasional patients have pulmonary involvement at the time of presentation. Patients presenting
in the first decade frequently are not Jewish and have growth retardation and a more malignant course. Other patients may be discovered fortuitously during evaluation for other conditions or as part
of routine examinations; these patients may have a milder or even a
benign course. In symptomatic patients, splenomegaly is progressive
and can become massive. Most patients develop radiologic evidence
of skeletal involvement, including an Erlenmeyer flask deformity of
the distal femur. Clinically apparent bony involvement, which occurs
in most patients, can present as bone pain, a pseudo-­osteomyelitis
pattern, or pathologic fractures. Lytic lesions can develop in the long
bones, including the femur, ribs, and pelvis; osteosclerosis may be
evident at an early age. Bone crises with severe pain and swelling
can occur. Bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia may manifest as
epistaxis or bruising and is frequently overlooked until other symptoms become apparent. With the exception of the severely growth-­
stunted child, who may experience developmental delay secondary to
the effects of chronic disease, development and intelligence are normal.

The pathologic hallmark of Gaucher disease is the Gaucher cell in
the reticuloendothelial system, particularly in the bone marrow (Fig.
106.19). These cells, which are 20-­100 μm in diameter, have a characteristic wrinkled paper appearance resulting from the presence of
intracytoplasmic substrate inclusions. The cytoplasm of the Gaucher
cell reacts strongly positive with the periodic acid–Schiff stain. The
presence of this cell in bone marrow and tissue specimens is highly
suggestive of Gaucher disease, although it also may be found in patients
with granulocytic leukemia and myeloma.
Gaucher disease type 2 is much less common and does not have an
ethnic predilection. It is characterized by a rapid neurodegenerative
course with extensive visceral involvement and death within the first
years of life. It presents in infancy with increased tone, strabismus, and
organomegaly. Failure to thrive and stridor caused by laryngospasm are
typical. After a several-­year period of psychomotor regression, death
occurs secondary to respiratory compromise. Gaucher disease type 3
presents as clinical manifestations that are intermediate to those seen
in types 1 and 2, with a presentation in childhood and death by age 10-­
15 years. It has a predilection for the Swedish Norrbottnian population,
among which the incidence is about 1/50,000. Neurologic involvement
is present. Type 3 disease is further classified as types 3a and 3b based
on the extent of neurologic involvement and whether there is progressive myotonia and dementia (type 3a) or isolated supranuclear gaze
palsy (type 3b).
Gaucher disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
patients with unexplained organomegaly, who bruise easily, have bone
pain, or have a combination of these conditions. Bone marrow examination usually reveals the presence of Gaucher cells. All suspected

diagnoses should be confirmed by genetic testing or by determination of the acid β-­glucosidase activity in isolated leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts. In Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, the identification
of carriers can be achieved best by molecular testing for the common
pathogenic variants. Testing should be offered to all family members,
keeping in mind that heterogeneity, even among members of the same
kindred, can be so great that asymptomatic affected individuals may
be diagnosed. Prenatal diagnosis is available by determination of the
specific family pathogenic variants and/or enzyme activity of chorionic
villi or cultured amniotic fluid cells.
Treatment of patients with Gaucher disease type 1 includes enzyme
replacement therapy, with recombinant acid β-­glucosidase (imiglucerase). Most extraskeletal symptoms (organomegaly, hematologic
indices) are reversed by enzymes (60 IU/kg) administered by intravenous infusion every other week. Monthly maintenance enzyme
replacement improves bone structure, decreases bone pain, and
induces compensatory growth in affected children. A small number
of patients have undergone bone marrow transplantation, which can
be curative but results in significant morbidity and mortality from
the procedure, making the selection of appropriate candidates limited. Although enzyme replacement does not alter the neurologic
progression of patients with Gaucher disease types 2 and 3, it has
been used in selected patients as a palliative measure, particularly in
type 3 patients with severe visceral involvement. Alternative treatments, including the use of agents designed to decrease the synthesis of glucosylceramide by chemical inhibition of glucosylceramide
synthase, are available for patients who cannot be treated by enzyme
replacement.

NIEMANN-­PICK DISEASE

Type A NPD is a fatal disorder of infancy characterized by failure to
thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative course that leads to death by 2-­3 years of age. Type B disease is
a non-­neuronopathic form observed in children and adults. Type C
disease is a neuronopathic form that results from defective cholesterol
transport. All subtypes are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and
display variable clinical features (see Tables 106.15 and 106.16).
NPD types A and B result from the deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase, a lysosomal enzyme encoded by the gene SMPD1. The enzymatic defect results in the pathologic accumulation of sphingomyelin, a

ceramide phospholipid, and other lipids in the monocyte-­macrophage
system as the primary pathologic site. The progressive deposition of
sphingomyelin in the CNS results in the neurodegenerative course seen
in type A and in non-­neural tissue in the systemic disease manifestations of type B, including progressive lung disease in some patients. A
variety of pathogenic variants in SMPD1 that cause types A and B NPD
have been identified.
The clinical manifestations and course of type A NPD is uniform and
characterized by a normal appearance at birth. Hepatosplenomegaly,
moderate lymphadenopathy, and psychomotor retardation are evident
by 6 months of age, followed by neurodevelopmental regression and
death by 3 years. With advancing age, the loss of motor function and
the deterioration of intellectual capabilities are progressively debilitating with spasticity and rigidity and in later stages. Affected infants lose
contact with their environment. In contrast to the stereotyped type A
phenotype, the clinical presentation and course of patients with type B
disease are more variable. Most are diagnosed in infancy or childhood
when enlargement of the liver or spleen, or both, is detected during a
routine physical examination. At diagnosis, type B NPD patients usually have evidence of mild pulmonary involvement, usually detected as
a diffuse reticular or finely nodular infiltration on the chest radiograph.
Pulmonary symptoms usually present in adulthood. In most patients,
hepatosple-­nomegaly is particularly prominent in childhood, but with
increasing linear growth, the abdominal protuberance decreases and
becomes less conspicuous. In mildly affected patients, the splenomegaly may not be noted until adulthood, and there may be minimal disease manifestations.
In some type B patients, decreased pulmonary diffusion caused
by alveolar infiltration becomes evident in late childhood or early

adulthood and progresses with age. Severely affected individuals may
experience significant pulmonary compromise by 15-­20 years of age.
Such patients have low Po2 values and dyspnea on exertion. Life-­
threatening bronchopneumonias may occur, and cor pulmonale has
been described. Severely affected patients may have liver involvement
leading to life-­threatening cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites.
Clinically significant pancytopenia caused by secondary hypersplenism may require partial or complete splenectomy; this should be
avoided if possible because splenectomy frequently causes progression of pulmonary disease, which can be life-­threatening. In general,
type B patients do not have neurologic involvement and have a normal IQ. Some patients with type B disease have cherry red maculae
or haloes and subtle neurologic symptoms that can include peripheral
neuropathy.
Type C NPD patients often present with prolonged neonatal jaundice,
appear normal for 1-­2 years, and then experience a slowly progressive
and variable neurodegenerative course. Their hepato¬splenomegaly
is less severe than that of patients with types A or B NPD, and they
may survive into adulthood. The underlying biochemical defect in type
C patients is an abnormality in cholesterol transport, leading to the
accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in their lysosomes and
a secondary partial reduction in acid sphingomyelinase activity (see
Chapter 106.3).
In type B NPD patients, splenomegaly is usually the first manifestation detected. The splenic enlargement is noted in early childhood. In
very mild disease, the enlargement may be subtle and detection may
be delayed until adolescence or adulthood. The presence of the characteristic NPD cells in bone marrow aspirates supports the diagnosis of

type B NPD. Patients with type C NPD, however, also have extensive
infiltration of NPD cells in the bone marrow, and thus all suspected
cases should be evaluated genetically or enzymatically to confirm the
clinical diagnosis by measuring the acid sphingomyelinase activity
level in peripheral leuko¬cytes, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts,
or a combination of these cells. Patients with types A and B NPD have
markedly decreased enzyme levels (1–10%), whereas patients with
type C NPD have normal or mildly decreased acid sphingomyelinase
activities. Without known genetic causes, the enzymatic identification
of NPD carriers is problematic. In families in which the specific genetic
lesion has been identified, however, family members can be accurately
tested for heterozygote status by DNA analysis. Prenatal diagnosis of
types A and B NPD can be made by genetic testing and reliably by the
measurement of acid sphingomyelinase activity in cultured amniocytes
or chorionic villi. Historically, the diagnosis of Niemann-­Pick type C
has relied on the demonstration of the cholesterol transport defect in
cultured fibroblasts by filipin staining but is now readily accomplished
by genetic testing of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes and the measurement
of oxidative cholesterol metabolites. There is no conclusive treatment
for types A and B NPD. Orthotopic liver transplantation in an infant
with type A disease and amniotic cell transplantation in several type B
NPD patients have been attempted with little or no success. Bone marrow transplantation in a small number of type B NPD patients has been
shown to be successful in reducing the spleen and liver volumes, the
sphingomyelin content of the liver, the number of Niemann-­Pick cells
in the marrow, and radiologically detected infiltration of the lungs. In
one patient, liver biopsies taken up to 33 months after transplantation
showed only a moderate reduction in stored sphingomyelin. Lung
transplantation has not been performed in any severely compromised
patient with type B disease, although two patients who underwent
whole lung lavages with variable results have been reported. Enzyme
replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (olipudase alpha) is in clinical trials for the treatment of
NPD type B. A 26-­week phase 1b study in adult patients with NPD
B established initial proof of concept in this patient group. In a phase
1/2 pediatric trial (ASCEND-­Peds/NCT02292654) in children with
chronic acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), olipudase alfa was
generally well-­tolerated with improvements in disease pathology, and
a phase 1/2 clinical trial in pediatric patients and a randomized phase
2/3 trial in adults (ASCEND) with ASMD documented improvement
in lung function and spleen size.
Clinical trials of miglustat (Actelion, Basel, Switzerland) have been
performed, and the drug has been approved in Europe for the treatment of type C disease. Treatment of type A disease with bone marrow
transplantation has not been successful, presumably because of severe
neurologic involvement.

894 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
FABRY DISEASE

Fabry disease is an X-­linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid
metabolism characterized by angiokeratomas (telangiectatic skin
lesions); hypohidrosis; corneal and lenticular opacities; acroparesthesias; and vascular disease of the kidney, heart, and/or brain (see
Table 106.15). The classic phenotype is caused by deficient activity
of the enzyme α-­galactosidase A and has an estimated prevalence
of approximately 1/50,000 males. Later-­onset affected males with
residual α-­galactosidase A activity may present with cardiac and/or
renal disease, including hypertrophic cardio¬myopathy and renal
failure, and is more prevalent than the classic phenotype. Heterozygous females for the classic phenotype can be either asymptomatic
or as severely affected as the males—the variability is a result of
random X-­inactivation. The disease results from pathogenic variants in α-­galactosidase A encoded by the X-­linked GLA gene. The
enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral
glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide, particularly
in the plasma and lysosomes of vascular endothelial and smooth
muscle cells. The progressive vascular glycosphingolipid deposition
in classically affected males results in ischemia and infarction, leading to the major disease manifestations. The cDNA and genomic
sequences encoding α-­galactosidase A have identified more than
500 different pathogenic variants in the α-­galactosidase A gene
that are responsible for this lysosomal storage disease, including
amino acid substitutions, gene rearrangements, and mRNA splicing defects.
Affected males with the classic phenotype have the skin lesions,
acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, and ocular changes, whereas males
with the later-­onset phenotypes lack these findings and present
with cardiac and/or renal disease in adulthood (Table 106.18). The
classic angiokeratomas usually occur in childhood and may lead to
early diagnosis (Fig. 106.20). They increase in size and number with
age and range from barely visible to several millimeters in diameter. The lesions are punctate, dark red to blue-­black, and flat or
slightly raised. They do not blanch with pressure, and the larger
ones may show slight hyperkeratosis. Characteristically, the lesions
are most dense between the umbilicus and knees, in the “bathing
trunk area,” but may occur anywhere, including the oral mucosa.
The hips, thighs, buttocks, umbilicus, lower abdomen, scrotum, and
glans penis are common sites, and there is a tendency toward symmetry. Variants without skin lesions have been described. Sweating
is usually decreased or absent. Corneal opacities and characteristic
lenticular lesions, observed under slit-­lamp examination, are present in affected males and in about 90% of heterozygotes. Conjunctival and retinal vascular tortuosity is common and results from the
systemic vascular involvement.
Pain is the most debilitating symptom in childhood and adolescence. Fabry crises, lasting from minutes to several days, consist of
agonizing, burning pain in the hands, feet, and proximal extremities and are usually associated with exercise, fatigue, fever, or a
combination of these factors. These painful acroparesthesias usually become less frequent in the third and fourth decades of life,
although in some men, they may become more frequent and severe.
Attacks of abdominal or flank pain may simulate appendicitis or
renal colic.
The major morbid symptoms result from the progressive involvement of the vascular system. Early in the course of the disease,
casts, red cells, and lipid inclusions with characteristic birefringent
“Maltese crosses” appear in the urinary sediment. Proteinuria, isosthenuria, and gradual deterioration of renal function and development of azotemia occur in the second through fourth decades.
Cardiovascular findings may include hypertension, left ventricular
hypertrophy, anginal chest pain, myocardial ischemia or infarction,
and heart failure. Mitral insufficiency is the most common valvular lesion. Abnormal electrocardiographic and echocardiographic
findings are common. Cerebrovascular manifestations result from
multifocal small vessel involvement. Other features may include

cardiac manifestations include hypertrophy of the left ventricular
wall and interventricular septum and electrocardiographic abnormalities consistent with cardiomyopathy. Others have had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or myocardial infarction, or both.
The diagnosis in classically affected males is most readily made
from the history of painful acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, the
presence of characteristic skin lesions, and the observation of the
characteristic corneal opacities and lenticular lesions. The disorder is often misdiagnosed as rheumatic fever, erythromelalgia, or
neurosis (Table 106.19). The skin lesions must be differentiated
from the benign angiokeratomas of the scrotum (Fordyce disease)
or from angiokeratoma circumscriptum. Angiokeratomas identical
to those of Fabry disease have been reported in fucosidosis, aspartylglycosaminuria, late-­onset GM1 gangliosidosis, galactosialidosis,
α-­N-­acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, and sialidosis. Later-­onset

895

patients have been identified among patients on hemodialysis and
among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or who have suffered cryptogenic strokes. Later-­onset patients lack the early classic
manifestations such as the angiokeratomas, acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, and corneal opacities. The diagnosis of classic and later-­
onset patients is confirmed biochemically by the demonstration of
markedly decreased α-­galactosidase A activity in plasma, isolated
leukocytes, or cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts.
Heterozygous females may have corneal opacities, isolated skin
lesions, and intermediate activities of α-­galactosidase A in plasma
or cells. Rare female heterozygotes may have manifestations as
severe as those in affected males. Asymptomatic at-­risk females in
families affected by Fabry disease, however, should be optimally
diagnosed by the direct analysis of their family’s specific pathogenic
variant. Prenatal detection of affected males can be accomplished
by the demonstration of deficient α-­galactosidase A activity or the
family’s specific gene pathogenic variant in chorionic villi obtained
in the first trimester or in cultured amniocytes obtained by amniocentesis in the second trimester of pregnancy. Fabry disease can be
detected by newborn screening, and pilot studies have been conducted in Italy and Taiwan.
Treatment for Fabry disease may include the use of phenytoin and/
or carbamazepine to decrease the frequency and severity of the chronic
acroparesthesias and the periodic crises of excruciating pain. Renal
transplantation and long-­term hemodialysis are lifesaving procedures
for patients with renal failure.
Recombinant α-­galactosidase is a safe and effective ERT of choice for
Fabry disease at a dose of 1 mg/kg every other week. It has been shown
to clear microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide
from the kidneys, heart, and skin in patients with Fabry disease with
stabilization of renal disease, regression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, reduction of pain, and improvement in quality of life. Migalastat, a
protein-­folding chaperone therapy, is an oral treatment for Fabry that
can both be used as a first-­line therapy in ERT-­naïve patients and as an
alternative to ERT in patients with a migalastat-­amenable pathogenic
variant.

FUCOSIDOSIS

This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficient
activity of α-­fucosidase and the accumulation of fucose-­containing
glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides in the
lysosomes of the liver, brain, and other organs (see Table 106.15).
α-­Fucosidase is encoded by the FUCA1 gene, and specific pathogenic variants are known. Although the disorder is panethnic, most
affected patients are from Italy and the United States. There is wide
variability in the clinical phenotype, with the most severely affected
patients presenting in the first year of life with developmental delay
and somatic features similar to those of the mucopolysaccharidoses.
These features include frontal bossing, hepatosplenomegaly, facial
features, and macroglossia. The CNS storage results in a relentless neurodegenerative course, with death in childhood. Patients
with milder disease have angiokeratomas and longer survival. No
specific therapy exists for the disorder, which can be diagnosed by
the demonstration of pathogenic variants in FUCA1 or deficient α-­
fucosidase activity in peripheral leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts.
Carrier identification studies and prenatal diagnosis are possible
by determination of the enzymatic activity or the specific family
pathogenic variants.

SCHINDLER DISEASE

Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that results from the deficient activity of α-­N-­
acetylgalactosaminidase and the accumulation of sialylated and
asialoglycopeptides and oligosaccharides (see Table 106.15). The
enzyme is encoded by the gene NAGA. The disease is clinically
heterogeneous, and two major phenotypes have been identified.
Type I disease is an infantile-­onset neuroaxonal dystrophy. Affected

896 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
infants have normal development for the first 9-­15 months of life
followed by a rapid neurodegenerative course that results in severe
intellectual disability, cortical blindness, and frequent myoclonic
seizures. Type II disease is characterized by a variable age at onset,
mild retardation, and angiokeratomas. There is no specific therapy
for either form of the disorder. The diagnosis is by demonstration of
the enzymatic deficiency in leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts
or specific gene pathogenic variants.

METACHROMATIC LEUKODYSTROPHY (MLD)

This is an autosomal recessive white matter disease caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ASA) encoded by the gene ARSA, which is
required for the hydrolysis of sulfated glycosphingolipids. Another
form of MLD is caused by a deficiency of a sphingolipid activator
protein (SAP1) encoded by the gene PSAP, which is required for
the formation of the substrate-­enzyme complex. The deficiency of
this enzymatic activity results in the white matter storage of sulfated
glycosphingolipids, which leads to demyelination and a neurodegenerative course. Pathogenic variants fall into two groups that correlate with disease severity.
The clinical manifestations of the late infantile form of MLD,
which is most common, usually present between 12 and 18 months
of age as irritability, inability to walk, and hyperextension of the
knee, causing genu recurvatum. The clinical progression of the
disease relates to the pathologic involvement of both central and
peripheral nervous systems, giving a mixture of upper and lower
motor neuron and cognitive and psychiatric signs. Deep tendon
reflexes are diminished or absent. Gradual muscle wasting, weakness, and hypotonia become evident and lead to a debilitated state.
As the disease progresses, nystagmus, myoclonic seizures, optic
atrophy, and quadriparesis appear, with death in the first decade of
life (see Table 106.15). The juvenile form of the disorder has a more
indolent course with an onset that may occur as late as 20 years of
age. This form of the disease presents with gait disturbances, mental
deterioration, urinary incontinence, and emotional difficulties. The
adult form, which presents after the second decade, is similar to
the juvenile form in its clinical manifestations, although emotional
difficulties and psychosis are more prominent features. Dementia,
seizures, diminished reflexes, and optic atrophy also occur in both
the juvenile and adult forms. The pathologic hallmark of MLD is
the deposition of metachromatic bodies, which stain strongly positive with periodic acid–Schiff and Alcian blue, in the white matter of the brain. Neuronal inclusions may be seen in the midbrain,
pons, medulla, retina, and spinal cord; demyelination occurs in
the peripheral nervous system. Bone marrow transplantation has
resulted in normal enzymatic levels in peripheral blood but there
is no clear evidence for clinical efficacy in terms of the neurologic
course; supportive care remains the primary intervention. Lentiviral transduced ex vivo autologous stem and progenitor cells with
human arylsulfatase cDNA treatment has resulted in sustained and
clinically important benefits in children with early onset disease.
Cognitive function has been preserved, as has motor development
in preliminary trials.
The diagnosis of MLD should be suspected in patients with the
clinical features of leukodystrophy. Decreased nerve con¬duction
velocities, increased cerebrospinal fluid protein, metachromatic
deposits in sampled segments of the sural nerve, and metachromatic
granules in urinary sediment are all suggestive of MLD. Confirmation of the diagnosis is based on the demonstration of pathogenic
variants in ARSA or reduced activity of ASA in leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts. Sphingolipid activator protein deficiency is
diagnosed by genetic testing of PSAP or by measuring the concentration of SAP1 in cultured fibroblasts using a specific antibody to
the protein. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are available
for all forms of the disorder.

MULTIPLE SULFATASE DEFICIENCY

This is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from the enzymatic deficiency of at least nine sulfatases including arylsulfatases
A, B, and C and iduronate-­2-­sulfatase. The specific defect has been
shown to be an enzyme in the C-­α-­formylglycine generating system encoded by the gene SUMF1, which introduces a common
posttranslational modification in all of the affected sulfatases and
explains the occurrence of these multiple enzyme defects. Because
of the deficiency of these enzymes, sulfatides, mucopolysaccharides, steroid sulfates, and gangliosides accumulate in the cerebral
cortex and visceral tissues, resulting in a clinical phenotype with
features of leukodystrophy as well as those of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Severe ichthyosis may also occur. Carrier testing and
prenatal diagnosis by measurement of the enzymatic activities can
be performed. There is no specific treatment for multiple sulfatase
deficiency other than supportive care.

KRABBE DISEASE

This condition, also called globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive fatal disorder of infancy. It results from the deficiency of
the enzymatic activity of galactocerebrosidase encoded by the GALC
gene, leading to white matter accumulation of galactosylceramide,
which is normally found almost exclusively in the myelin sheath. Both
peripheral and central myelin are affected, resulting in spasticity and
cognitive impairment coupled with deceptively normal or even absent
deep tendon reflexes. Specific disease-­causing pathogenic variants are
known. The infantile form of Krabbe disease is rapidly progressive, and
patients present in early infancy with irritability, seizures, and hypertonia (see Table 106.16). Optic atrophy is evident in the first years of life,
and cognitive development is severely impaired. As the disease progresses, optic atrophy and severe developmental delay become apparent; affected children exhibit opisthotonos and typically die before 3
years of age. A second, late infantile form of Krabbe disease also exists,
and patients present after the age of 2 years. Affected individuals, however, have a disease course similar to that of the early infantile form.
The diagnosis of Krabbe disease relies on the demonstration of the
specific pathogenic variants or by enzymatic deficiency in white blood
cells or cultured skin fibroblasts. Carrier identification and prenatal
diagnosis are available. The development of methods to measure GALC
activity on dried blood spots has led to the inclusion of Krabbe disease in the newborn screening programs of some states. Treatment of
infants with Krabbe disease with umbilical cord blood cell transplantation has been reported in prenatally identified asymptomatic newborns and symptomatic infants. The long-­term outcome of umbilical
cord blood cell transplantation is being evaluated; transplanted infants
develop neurologic manifestations at a slower rate but succumb to a
neurologic demise.

FARBER DISEASE

This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results from the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase and the accumulation of ceramide in various tissues, especially the joints. Symptoms can
begin as early as the first year of life with painful joint swelling and
nodule formation (Fig. 106.21), which is sometimes diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis. As the disease progresses, nodule or granulomatous
formation on the vocal cords can lead to hoarseness and breathing difficulties; failure to thrive is common. In some patients, moderate CNS
dysfunction is present (see Table 106.16). Patients may die of recurrent
pneumonias in their teens; there is currently no specific therapy. The
diagnosis of this disorder should be suspected in patients who have
nodule formation over the joints but no other findings of rheumatoid
arthritis. In such patients, ceramidase activity should be determined
in cultured skin fibroblasts or peripheral leukocytes. Various disease-­
causing pathogenic variants have been identified in the gene encoding
acid ceramidase (ASAH1). Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are

available. There is no specific treatment, but a recombinant human acid
ceramidase is under development.

WOLMAN DISEASE AND CHOLESTEROL ESTER
STORAGE DISEASE (CESD)

These are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases that result
from the deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase and the accumulation of
cholesterol esters and triglycerides in histiocytic foam cells of most
visceral organs. Wolman disease is the more severe clinical phenotype
and is a fatal disorder of infancy. Clinical features become apparent
in the first weeks of life and include failure to thrive, relentless vomiting, abdominal distention, steatorrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly (see
Table 106.15). There usually is hyperlipidemia. Hepatic dysfunction
and fibrosis may occur. Calcification of the adrenal glands is pathognomonic for the disorder. Death usually occurs within 6 months.
CESD is a less severe disorder that may not be diagnosed until
adulthood. Hepatomegaly can be the only detectable abnormality, but
affected individuals are at significant risk for premature atherosclerosis.
Adrenal calcification is not a feature.
Lysosomal acid lipase is encoded by the LIPA gene. Diagnosis and
carrier identification can be performed by genetic testing or by measuring acid lipase activity in peripheral leukocytes or cultured skin
fibroblasts. Prenatal diagnosis can use pathogenic variants or enzyme
levels in cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes. Pharmacologic agents
to suppress cholesterol synthesis, in combination with cholestyramine
and diet modification, have been used in patients with CESD (see
Chapter 106.3). Sebelipase alfa (Kanuma) is a commercially available
recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase that is approved in the European Union (EU), the United States, and Japan as a long-­term ERT for
patients diagnosed with LAL deficiency.

106.5 Mucolipidoses

897

disorders that share some clinical features with Hurler syndrome
(see Chapter 109). These diseases result from the abnormal transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes that are normally
targeted to the lysosome by the presence of mannose-­6-­phosphate
residues and recognized by specific lysosomal membrane receptors.
These mannose-­6-­phosphate recognition markers are synthesized
in a two-­step reaction that occurs in the Golgi apparatus and is
mediated by two enzymatic activities. The enzyme that catalyzes
the first step, the UDP-­
N-­
acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme
N-­
acetylglucosamine-­
1-­
phosphotransferase, is defective in both
ML-­
II and ML-­
III, which are allelic disorders resulting from
pathogenic variants in the GlcNAc-­
phosphotransferase alpha/
beta-­subunits precursor gene (GNPTAB). This enzyme deficiency
results in the lack of mannose-­6-­phosphate tagging of lysosomal
enzymes to result in disrupted targeting to the lysosome, and they
are consequently secreted into the extracellular matrix. Because
the lysosomal enzymes require the acidic medium of the lysosome
to function, patients with this defect accumulate a variety of different substrates because of the intracellular deficiency of all lysosomal enzymes. The diagnosis of ML-­II and ML-­III can be made by
genetic testing of the GNPTAB gene, determination of the serum
lysosomal enzymatic activities, which are elevated, or by the demonstration of reduced enzymatic activity levels in cultured skin
fibroblasts. Direct measurement of the phosphotransferase activity
is possible as well. Prenatal diagnosis is available for both disorders
using familial pathogenic variants or by measurement of lysosomal
enzymatic activities in amniocytes or chorionic villus cells; carrier
identification studies are available for both disorders using cultured
skin fibroblasts. Neonatal screening by tandem mass spectroscopy
may detect I-­cell disease.

I-­CELL DISEASE

This disorder shares many of the clinical manifestations of Hurler
syndrome (see Chapter 109), although there is no mucopolysacchariduria and the presentation is earlier (see Table 106.16). Some
patients have clinical features evident at birth, including coarse
facial features, craniofacial abnormalities, restricted joint movement, and hypotonia. Nonimmune hydrops may be present prenatally. The remainder of patients present in the first year with severe
psychomotor retardation, coarse facial features, and skeletal manifestations that include kyphoscoliosis and a lumbar gibbus. Patients
may also have congenital dislocation of the hips, inguinal hernias,
and gingival hypertrophy. Progressive, severe intellectual disability
leads to death in early childhood. No treatment is available.

PSEUDO-­HURLER POLYDYSTROPHY

Pseudo-­Hurler polydystrophy is a less severe disorder than I-­cell
disease, with later onset and survival to adulthood reported.
Affected children may present around the age of 4 or 5 years of
age with joint stiffness and short stature. Progressive destruction
of the hip joints and moderate dysostosis multiplex are evident.
Radiographic evidence of low iliac wings, flattening of the proximal
femoral epiphyses with valgus deformity of the femoral head, and
hypoplasia of the anterior third of the lumbar vertebrae are characteristic findings. Ophthalmic findings include corneal clouding,
retinopathy, and astigmatism; visual complaints are uncommon
(see Tables 106.15 and 106.16). Some patients have learning disabilities or mental retardation. Treatment, which should include
orthopedic care, is symptomatic.

898 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders

Chapter 107

Defects in Metabolism of
Carbohydrates
Ghada Hijazi and Priya S. Kishnani
Carbohydrate synthesis and degradation provide the energy required
for most metabolic processes. The important carbohydrates include
three monosaccharides—glucose, galactose, and fructose—and a
polysaccharide, glycogen. Figure 107.1 shows the relevant biochemical pathways of these carbohydrates. Glucose is the principal substrate of energy metabolism, continuously available through dietary
intake, glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen), and gluconeogenesis
(glucose made de novo from amino acids, primarily alanine). Metabolism of glucose generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via glycolysis (conversion of glucose or glycogen to pyruvate), mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (conversion of pyruvate to carbon dioxide
and water), or both. Dietary sources of glucose come from polysaccharides, primarily starch, and the disaccharides lactose, maltose, and
sucrose. However, oral intake of glucose is intermittent and unreliable. Hepatic glycogenolysis provides the rapid release of glucose
and is the most significant factor in maintaining euglycemia (normal
levels of glucose in the blood). Glycogen is also the primary stored
energy source in muscle, providing glucose for muscle activity during
exercise. Gluconeogenesis contributes to maintaining euglycemia but
is less immediate. Galactose and fructose are monosaccharides that
provide fuel for cellular metabolism, though their role is less significant than that of glucose. Galactose is derived from lactose (galactose
+ glucose), which is found in milk and milk products. Galactose is an
important energy source in infants. Galactose (exogenous or endogenously synthesized from glucose) is also an important component
of certain glycolipids, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans. The
dietary sources of fructose are fruits, vegetables, and honey. It is also
found in the disaccharide sucrose (fructose + glucose) and the sugar
alcohol sorbitol.
Defects in glycogen metabolism typically cause an accumulation of
glycogen in the tissues, thus the name glycogen storage disease (Table
107.1). Defects in gluconeogenesis or the glycolytic pathway, including
galactose and fructose metabolism, do not result in an accumulation
of glycogen (see Table 107.1). The defects in pyruvate metabolism in
the pathway of the conversion of pyruvate to carbon dioxide and water
via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are more often associated
with lactic acidosis.

107.1 Glycogen Storage Diseases
Ghada Hijazi and Priya S. Kishnani
The disorders of glycogen metabolism, the glycogen storage diseases
(GSDs), result from deficiencies of enzymes or transport proteins in
the pathways of glycogen metabolism (see Fig. 107.1). Glycogen found
in these disorders is abnormal in quantity, quality, or both. GSDs are
categorized by numerical type in accordance with the chronological
order in which these enzymatic defects were identified. This numerical
classification is still widely used, at least up to number VII. The GSDs
can also be classified by organ involvement into liver and muscle glycogenoses (see Table 107.1).
There are more than 15 forms of GSDs. Glucose-­6-­phosphatase
deficiency (type I), lysosomal acid α-­glucosidase deficiency (type II),
debrancher deficiency (type III), branching enzyme deficiency (type
IV), liver phosphorylase deficiency (type VI), and liver phosphorylase
kinase deficiency (type IX) are the most common of those that typically

present in early childhood. Myophosphorylase deficiency (type V,
McArdle disease) is the most common in adolescents and adults. The
cumulative frequency of all forms of GSD is approximately 1 in 10,000-­
25,000 live births.

LIVER GLYCOGENOSES

The GSDs that principally affect the liver include glucose-­6-­phosphatase
deficiency (type I), debranching enzyme deficiency (type III), branching enzyme deficiency (type IV), liver phosphorylase deficiency
(type VI), phosphorylase kinase deficiency (type IX), glycogen synthase deficiency (type 0), and glucose transporter-­2 (GLUT2) defect
(Fanconi-­Bickel syndrome). Because hepatic carbohydrate metabolism
is responsible for plasma glucose homeostasis, this group of disorders
typically causes fasting hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly. Some GSDs
(types III, IV, VI, IX) can be associated with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Other organs can also be involved and may manifest as renal dysfunction in type I; myopathy (skeletal and/or cardiomyopathy) in types
III, IV, and some rare forms of phosphorylase kinase deficiency; and
neurologic involvement in types III (peripheral nerves) and IV (diffuse
central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction).

Type I Glycogen Storage Disease (Glucose-­6-­
Phosphatase or Translocase Deficiency, von Gierke
Disease)

Type I GSD is caused by the absence or deficiency of glucose-­6-­
phosphatase activity in the liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. It has two
subtypes: type Ia, in which the defective enzyme is glucose-­6-­phosphatase,
and type Ib, in which the defective enzyme is a translocase that transports
glucose-­6-­phosphate across the microsomal membrane. Deficiency of the
enzymes in both types Ia and Ib lead to inadequate hepatic conversion of
glucose-­6-­phosphate to glucose through normal glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in fasting hypoglycemia.
Type I GSD is an autosomal recessive disorder. The gene for subtype
Ia is G6PC, and the gene for subtype Ib is SLC37A4. Common pathogenic variants have been identified in different ancestral populations.
Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are possible with DNA-­based
methodologies.

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with type I GSD may present in the neonatal period with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, but more often present at 3-­4 months of
age because of increased intervals between feeds and at time of weaning.
Infants can present with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemic seizures, or both.
Affected children are often described as having “doll-­like” faces with full
cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen that is a consequence of massive hepatomegaly. The kidneys are also
enlarged, whereas the spleen and heart are not involved.
Intermittent diarrhea may occur in GSD I. In patients with GSD
Ib, diarrhea appears to be caused by the loss of mucosal barrier function via inflammation, which is likely related to glycogen-­mediated
impairment of neutrophil function. Easy bruising and epistaxis
are common and are associated with a prolonged bleeding time
as a result of impaired platelet aggregation and adhesion. A von
Willebrand factor–like deficiency and/or dysfunction has also been
found in GSD Ia patients.
The biochemical characteristics of type I GSD are hypoglycemia,
lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. Hypoglycemia and
lactic acidosis can develop even after short fasts. Hyperuricemia is present in young children and rarely progresses to symptomatic gout before
puberty. Despite marked hepatomegaly, the liver transaminase levels
are usually normal or only slightly elevated. The plasma may be “milky”
in appearance due to strikingly elevated triglyceride levels. Cholesterol
and phospholipids are also elevated, albeit less prominently. The lipid
abnormality resembles type IV hyperlipidemia and is characterized by
increased levels of very low-­density lipoprotein, low-­density lipoprotein, and a unique apolipoprotein profile consisting of increased levels
of apolipoproteins B, C, and E, with relatively normal or reduced levels
of apolipoproteins A and D. The histologic appearance of the liver is
characterized by a universal distention of hepatocytes by glycogen and

fat. The lipid vacuoles are particularly large and prominent, and there
is no associated liver fibrosis.
Although type I GSD affects mainly the liver, multiple organ systems
are involved. Delayed puberty is often seen. Females can have ultrasound findings consistent with polycystic ovaries, even though other
features of polycystic ovary syndrome (acne, hirsutism) are not seen.
Nonetheless, fertility appears to be normal, as evidenced in several
reports of successful pregnancy in women with GSD I. Increased bleeding during menstrual cycles, including life-­threatening menorrhagia,
has been reported and could be related to the impaired platelet aggregation. Symptoms of gout usually start around puberty from long-­term
hyperuricemia. There is an increased risk of pancreatitis, secondary to
the lipid abnormalities. The dyslipidemia, together with elevated erythrocyte aggregation, could predispose these patients to atherosclerosis,

but premature atherosclerosis has not yet been clearly documented
except in rare cases. Impaired platelet aggregation and increased antioxidative defense to prevent lipid peroxidation may function as protective mechanisms to help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. Frequent
fractures and radiographic evidence of osteopenia are common, and
bone mineral content is reduced, even in prepubertal patients.
By the second or third decade of life, some patients with type I
GSD develop hepatic adenomas that can hemorrhage and become
malignant in some cases. Pulmonary hypertension has been seen
in some long-­term survivors of the disease. Iron-­refractory anemia
and an increased prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity are also being
recognized.
Renal disease is another late complication, and most patients
with type I GSD over 20 years of age have proteinuria. Glomerular

902 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
hyperfiltration, increased renal plasma flow, and microalbuminuria
are often found in the early stages of renal dysfunction and can occur
before the onset of proteinuria. In younger patients, hyperfiltration
and hyperperfusion may be the only signs of renal abnormalities.
Many also have hypertension, renal stones, nephrocalcinosis, proteinuria, renal tubular acidosis (proximal and distal renal acidification
defects), and altered creatinine clearance. With the advancement of
renal disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis become evident. In some patients, renal function has deteriorated
and progressed to failure, requiring dialysis and transplantation. Other
renal abnormalities include amyloidosis, a Fanconi-­like syndrome,
hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, and a distal renal tubular acidification
defect. Patients with GSD Ib can have additional features of recurrent
bacterial infections from neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function. Oral involvement, including recurrent mucosal ulceration, gingivitis, and rapidly progressive periodontal disease, may occur in type Ib.
Intestinal mucosa ulceration culminating in GSD enterocolitis is also
common. Type 1b is also associated with a chronic inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD)–like picture involving the colon that may be associated
with neutropenia and/or neutrophil dysfunction and can resemble
ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease.

Diagnosis

The clinical presentation and laboratory findings of hypoglycemia,
lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia lead to a suspected
diagnosis of type I GSD. Neutropenia is noted in GSD Ib patients,
although neutrophil counts may be normal initially. Neutropenia has
also been noted in some patients with GSD Ia, especially those with the
p.G188A variant. Administration of glucagon or epinephrine leads to
a negligible increase, if any, in blood glucose levels, but the lactate level
rises significantly. Before the availability of genetic testing, a definitive
diagnosis required enzyme testing via liver biopsy. Gene-­based variant analysis using single-­gene sequencing or multigene panel testing provides a noninvasive way to diagnose most patients with GSD
types Ia and Ib and has become the primary recommended method of
diagnosis.

Treatment

Treatment focuses on maintaining normal blood glucose levels and
is achieved by continuous nasogastric (NG) infusion of glucose or
administration of uncooked cornstarch. In infancy, overnight NG drip
feeding may be needed to maintain normoglycemia. NG feedings can
consist of a sucrose-­and lactose-­free enteral formula or only glucose
or a glucose polymer to provide sufficient glucose to maintain euglycemia. During the day, frequent feedings with high-­complex carbohydrate content are typically sufficient.
Uncooked cornstarch acts as a slow-­release form of glucose and can
be introduced at a dose of 1.6 g/kg every 4 hours for children less than
2 years of age. The response of young children is variable. For older
children, the cornstarch regimen can be changed to every 4-­6 hours at
a dose of 1.6-­2.5 g/kg body weight and can be given orally mixed with
water or a sucrose-­, fructose-­, and lactose-­free beverage. Cornstarch
dosing may also be calculated based on hepatic glucose production
rate and can be administered more frequently in smaller amounts to
improve metabolic control. Other starch products, such as extended-­
release waxy maize starch with a high amylopectin content, are shown
to be beneficial in extending time between overnight feedings in some
individuals with hepatic GSD. Because fructose and galactose cannot
be converted directly to glucose in GSD type I, these sugars should be
restricted in the diet. Sucrose (table sugar, cane sugar, other ingredients), fructose (fruit, juice, high-­fructose corn syrup), lactose (dairy
foods), and sorbitol should be avoided or limited. As a result of these
dietary restrictions, vitamins and minerals such as calcium and vitamin D may be deficient, and supplementation is required to prevent
nutritional deficiencies.
Maintaining normoglycemia and avoiding hypoglycemia necessitate
frequent blood glucose measurements in patients with hepatic GSDs.
This can be accomplished by self-­monitoring blood glucose (SMBG)
using a finger prick before and after meals, before physical activity,

and overnight. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMSs) are
a newer technique that allow for 24-­hour glucose monitoring. CGMSs
have been shown to be safe and effective tools for monitoring glucose
levels in patients with hepatic GSDs (GSD I, GSD III, GSD VI, GSD
IX) at all hours of the day. Furthermore, when accompanied with the
necessary dietary changes, CGMSs aid in metabolic control, improving
disease parameters, avoidance of hospitalizations, and blood glucose
stability in these patients.
Dietary therapy improves hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and renal
function, as well as slowing the development of renal failure. Blood
uric acid and lipid levels may, however, be elevated in some individuals,
despite good dietary compliance, especially after puberty. The control
of hyperuricemia can be further augmented by the use of allopurinol,
a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Hyperlipidemia can be reduced with
lipid-­lowering drugs, such as β-­hydroxy-­β-­methylglutaryl-­coenzyme
A (HMG-­CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibrate (see Chapter 106).
Microalbuminuria, an early indicator of renal dysfunction in type I disease, is treated with angiotensin-­converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
Citrate supplements can be beneficial for patients with hypocitraturia
by preventing or ameliorating nephrocalcinosis and development of
urinary calculi. Products containing citric acid reduce the effectiveness
of cornstarch and should not be taken concurrently. Thiazide diuretics increase renal reabsorption of filtered calcium and decrease urinary
calcium excretion, thereby preventing hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. Growth hormone (GH) should be used with extreme caution
and limited to only those with a documented GH deficiency. Even in
those patients, there should be close monitoring of metabolic parameters and for the presence of adenomas. Kidney transplantation may be
performed to treat end-­stage renal disease (ESRD). As needed, combined liver and kidney transplantation is sometimes recommended.
In patients with type Ib GSD, granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor is successful in correcting neutropenia, decreasing the number
and severity of bacterial infections, and improving chronic IBD; the
minimum effective dose should be used, given noted side effects with
this agent, including splenomegaly, hypersplenism, and bone pain,
with this agent. Vitamin E administration has been shown to improve
neutrophil count and function and to reduce the frequency and
severity of infections in GSD1b patients. The use of sodium glucose
cotransporter-­2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (empagliflozin) to improve neutrophil function and reduce neutropenia and IBD symptoms in GSDIb
is showing promising results. Bone marrow transplantation has been
reported to correct neutropenia in type Ib GSD.
Orthotopic liver transplantation is a potential cure for type I GSD,
especially for patients with liver malignancy, multiple liver adenomas,
metabolic derangements refractory to medical management, and liver
failure; however, because of the paucity of available organ donors, this
can be challenging. Large adenomas (>2 cm) that are rapidly increasing in size and/or number may necessitate partial hepatic resection.
Smaller adenomas (<2 cm) may be treated with percutaneous ethanol
injection or transcatheter arterial embolization. Recurrence of liver
adenomas is a challenge and may potentiate malignant transformation
in these patients, ultimately requiring a liver transplant. Before any surgical procedure, the bleeding status must be evaluated and good metabolic control established. Prolonged bleeding times can be normalized
with intensive intravenous (IV) glucose infusion for 24-­
48 hours
before surgery. Treatment with DDAVP (1-­
deamino-­
8-­
d-­
arginine
vasopressin) can reduce bleeding complications, but it should be used
with caution because of the risk of fluid overload and hyponatremia
when administered as an IV infusion. Lactated Ringer solution should
be avoided because it contains lactate and no glucose. Glucose levels
should be maintained in the normal range throughout surgery with the
use of 10% dextrose. Overall, metabolic control is assessed by growth,
improvement, and correction of the metabolic abnormalities such as
elevated lactate, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, and uric acid levels.
GSD I is a promising target for gene therapy because it is caused by
pathogenic variants in a single gene. An active phase 3 clinical trial
(NCT05139316) is being conducted to determine the efficacy and
safety of adeno-­associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)–mediated G6P
gene replacement in patients ages 8 years and older with GSD type Ia.

Prognosis

Inadequate metabolic control during childhood can lead to long-­term
complications in adults. Clinical outcomes have improved dramatically
with early diagnosis and effective treatment. However, serious complications such as renal disease and formation of hepatic adenomas with
potential risk for malignant transformation persist. The ability to identify
transformation of liver adenomas to hepatocellular carcinoma remains a
challenge as α-­fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
levels often remain normal in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Type III Glycogen Storage Disease (Cori Disease,
Forbes Disease, Debrancher Deficiency, Limit
Dextrinosis)

Type III GSD is caused by deficient activity of the glycogen debranching enzyme. This enzyme, together with phosphorylase and
phosphorylase kinase, are responsible for complete degradation of glycogen. When debranching enzyme is defective, glycogen breakdown
is incomplete, resulting in the accumulation of an abnormal glycogen
with short outer-­branch chains that resemble limit dextrin. GSD type
IIIa is the most common type and usually involves both liver and muscle; GSD type IIIb, seen in approximately 15% of patients, appears to
involve only the liver.
Type III GSD is an autosomal recessive disease that has been reported
in many different ethnic groups. The frequency is relatively high in
the Sephardic Jewish population from North Africa, inhabitants of
the Faroe Islands, and the Inuit population. The gene for debranching
enzyme (AGL) has been noted, with more than 260 different pathogenic variants. At least two pathogenic variants in exon 2, c.18_19del
(p.Gln6fs) and c.16C>T (p.Gln6Ter), are specifically associated with
GSD type IIIb. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are possible
using DNA-­based testing.

Clinical Manifestations

In infancy and childhood, type III GSD may be indistinguishable from
type I because of overlapping features such as hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and growth stunting (Fig. 107.2). Hepatomegaly in most patients with type III GSD decreases with age; however,
liver fibrosis and/or cirrhosis progressing to liver failure are noted in
many in late adulthood. Some patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic adenomas with transformation to carcinomas occur
less frequently in individuals with GSD III than in those with GSD I.
Alpha-­fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels
are not good predictors of malignant transformation.
In patients with GSD type IIIa, the muscle weakness is slowly progressive and associated with muscle wasting. The weakness can present in early childhood but can become severe after the third or fourth
decade of life. Myopathy does not follow a particular pattern of involvement, and both proximal and distal muscles are involved. Electromyography (EMG) reveals a widespread myopathy, and nerve conduction
studies may be abnormal.
Although overt cardiac dysfunction is rare, ventricular hypertrophy
is a frequent finding. Cardiac pathology has shown diffuse involvement of various cardiac structures, including vacuolation of myocytes,
fibrosis, glycogen accumulation in the conduction system, and hyperplasia of smooth muscles. Life-­threatening arrhythmia and the need
for heart transplant have been reported in some patients with GSD IIIa.
Hepatic symptoms in some patients may be mild and the diagnosis is
not made until adulthood, when patients show symptoms and signs of
neuromuscular disease.
The initial presentation can be confused with Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth
disease (see Chapter 653.1). Polycystic ovaries are noted; some patients
can develop hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and other features of
polycystic ovarian syndrome. Fertility does not appear to be affected;
successful pregnancies have been reported. Low bone mineral density
and myopathy in patients with GSD IIIa put them at an increased risk
of potential fractures.
Hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia are common. In contrast to type
I GSD, elevation of liver transaminase levels and fasting ketosis are
prominent, but blood lactate and uric acid concentrations are usually

Fig. 107.2 Growth and development in a patient with type IIIb gly-

cogen storage disease. The patient has debrancher deficiency in the
liver but normal activity in muscle. As a child, he had hepatomegaly,
hypoglycemia, and growth retardation. After puberty, he no longer had
hepatomegaly or hypoglycemia, and his final adult height is normal. He
had no muscle weakness or atrophy; this is in contrast to patients with
type IIIa, in whom a progressive myopathy is seen in adulthood.

normal. Glucagon administration 2 hours after a carbohydrate meal
provokes a normal increase in blood glucose. However, after an overnight fast, glucagon may provoke no change in blood glucose level.
Serum creatine kinase levels can be useful to identify patients with
muscle involvement, although normal levels do not rule out muscle
enzyme deficiency.

Diagnosis

The histologic appearance of the liver is characterized by a universal
distention of hepatocytes by glycogen and the presence of fibrous septa.
The fibrosis and the paucity of fat distinguish type III glycogenosis
from type I. The fibrosis, which ranges from minimal periportal fibrosis to micronodular cirrhosis, appears in most cases to be progressive.
Overt cirrhosis has been seen in some patients with GSD III.
Patients with myopathy and liver symptoms have a generalized
enzyme defect (type IIIa). The deficient enzyme activity can be demonstrated not only in liver and muscle but also in other tissues such
as heart, erythrocytes, and cultured fibroblasts. Patients with hepatic
symptoms without clinical or laboratory evidence of myopathy have
debranching enzyme deficiency only in the liver, with enzyme activity retained in the muscle (type IIIb). Before the availability of genetic
testing, a definitive diagnosis required enzyme assay in liver, muscle, or
both. Gene sequencing allows for diagnosis and subtype assignment in
the majority of patients.

Treatment

The mainstay of treatment of GSD III is dietary management, as in
GSD I, although it is less demanding. Patients do not need to restrict
dietary intake of fructose and galactose, although simple sugars should
be avoided to prevent sudden spikes in blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia can be prevented by small frequent meals rich in complex carbohydrates, such as cornstarch supplements or nocturnal gastric drip
feedings. Additionally, a high-­protein diet during the daytime as well
as overnight protein enteral infusion is effective in preventing hypoglycemia. The exogenous protein can be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, which helps to meet energy needs and prevent endogenous

904 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
protein breakdown. Protein in the diet also reduces the overall starch
requirement. Overtreatment with cornstarch should be avoided, as
it can result in excessive glycogen buildup, which is detrimental and
can lead to excessive weight gain. Medium-­chain triglyceride (MCT)
supplementation and a high-­fat diet are being considered as alternative
sources of energy. There is no satisfactory treatment for the progressive
myopathy other than recommending a high-­protein diet, physical therapy, and high-­fat diet in some patients. Close monitoring with abdominal MRI is needed to detect progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additional imaging techniques, such
as hepatic elastography, are being developed. Liver transplantation has
been performed in GSD III patients with progressive cirrhosis and/or
HCC. There are reports of cardiac transplant in GSD III patients with
end-­stage cardiac disease.

Type IV Glycogen Storage Disease (Branching
Enzyme Deficiency, Amylopectinosis, Polyglucosan
Disease, Andersen Disease, Adult Polyglucosan Body
Disease)

Type IV GSD is caused by the deficiency of branching enzyme activity, which results in the accumulation of an abnormal glycogen with
poor solubility. The disease is also known as amylopectinosis because
the abnormal glycogen has fewer α-­1,6 branch points, more α-­1,4
linked glucose units, and longer outer chains, resulting in a structure
resembling amylopectin. These excessively long peripheral glucan
chains form polyglucosan bodies, which are positive on periodic acid–
Schiff (PAS) and resistant to diastase digestion. Polyglucosan body
accumulation is seen in all affected patients but to different degrees
and in different tissues.
Type IV GSD is an autosomal recessive disorder. The glycogen
branching enzyme (GBE1) gene has been noted, with more than 128
pathogenic variants responsible for type IV GSD, and their characterization in individual patients can be useful in predicting clinical
outcome. The nearly complete absence of glycogen branching enzyme
(GBE) activity with null alleles has been associated with perinatal death
and fatal neonatal hypotonia. Residual GBE activity results in a continuum of disease manifestations ranging from progressive hepatic
cirrhosis, slowly progressive or nonprogressive liver disease, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron disease, and
leukodystrophy.

Clinical Manifestations

A high degree of clinical variability is associated with type IV GSD. The
most common and classic form is characterized by hepatic involvement with progressive cirrhosis of the liver and manifests in the first 18
months of life as hepatosplenomegaly and failure to thrive. Cirrhosis
may present with portal hypertension, ascites, and esophageal varices
and may progress to liver failure, usually leading to death by 5 years
of age. Some patients survive without progression of liver disease, and
they are considered to have a milder hepatic form and do not require
liver transplant. Extrahepatic involvement in some patients with GSD
IV consists of musculoskeletal involvement, particularly cardiac and
skeletal muscles, as well as central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement.
Neuromuscular forms of type IV GSD have been reported, with
four main subtypes recognized based on age at presentation. The perinatal form is characterized by a fetal akinesia deformation sequence
(FADS) and death in the perinatal period. The congenital form presents at birth with severe hypotonia, muscle atrophy, and neuronal
involvement, with death in the neonatal period; some patients have
cardiomyopathy. The childhood form presents primarily with myopathy or cardiomyopathy. The adult form, adult polyglucosan body disease
(APBD), presents with PNS dysfunction and diffuse CNS involvement,
accompanied by accumulation of polyglucosan material in the nervous
system. Symptoms of neuronal involvement include progressive muscle
weakness; gait spasticity; peripheral neuropathy; neuropathic bladder;
and, in many cases, leukodystrophy, mood disturbances, and cognitive
decline. APBD is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or cerebral small-­vessel disease (CSVD).

Diagnosis

Deposition of amylopectin-­like materials varies and can be demonstrated in the liver, heart, muscle, skin, intestine, brain, brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves (i.e., sural nerve) in type IV
GSD. For patients with hepatic involvement, liver histology shows
micronodular cirrhosis and faintly stained basophilic inclusions
in hepatocytes. The inclusions are composed of coarsely clumped,
stored material that is PAS positive and partially resistant to diastase digestion. Electron microscopy (EM) shows, in addition to
the conventional α and β glycogen particles, the accumulation
of fibrillar aggregations that are typical of amylopectin. Similar
nonmembrane-­bound cytoplasmic inclusions (PAS positive, diastase resistant) are observed in the cardiomyocytes and skeletal
muscle fibers, and polyglucosan bodies may be present in the
muscle biopsy from those with neuromuscular manifestations. In
APBD, a peripheral nerve biopsy reveals intra-­axonal polyglucosan
bodies, and histologic examination of brain tissue shows polyglucosan bodies often visualized in the astrocytes and neurons. The
distinct staining properties of the inclusions, as well as EM findings, could be diagnostic. However, polysaccharides with histologic
features reminiscent of type IV disease but without enzymatic correlation have been observed. The diagnosis is confirmed by either
identification of two pathogenic variants in GBE1 or a reduction
of GBE activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts. Prenatal diagnosis is
possible by measuring enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or
chorionic villi or by DNA-­based methodologies.

Treatment

There is no specific treatment for type IV GSD. Nervous system
involvement, such as gait problems and bladder involvement,
requires supportive, symptomatic management. Unlike patients
with other liver GSDs (I, III, VI, IX), those with GSD IV do not typically have hypoglycemia. Liver transplantation has been performed
for patients with progressive liver disease, but patients must be
carefully selected because this is a multisystem disease and, in some
patients, extrahepatic involvement may manifest or worsen after
transplant. Liver transplantation corrects the hepatic phenotype of
the disease but has no effects on the extrahepatic manifestations
such as myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Individuals with significant
diffuse reticuloendothelial involvement may have greater risk of
morbidity and mortality, which may affect the success rate for liver
transplant. Patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy may benefit from heart transplantation and physical
therapy, respectively.

Type VI Glycogen Storage Disease (Liver Phosphorylase Deficiency, Hers Disease)

Type VI GSD is caused by deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase. Patients usually present with hepatomegaly and growth stunting in infancy or early childhood. Hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia,
and hyperketosis are of variable severity. Ketotic hypoglycemia may
present after overnight or prolonged fasting. Lactic acid and uric
acid levels are normal. Type VI GSD presents within a broad spectrum of involvement, some with a more severe clinical presentation.
Patients with severe hepatomegaly, recurrent severe hypoglycemia
and hyperketosis have been reported. Focal nodular hyperplasia of
liver, hepatocellular adenoma with transformation into carcinoma,
hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis have been reported in some patients.

Diagnosis

GSD VI is an autosomal recessive disease. Diagnosis can be confirmed
through molecular testing of the liver phosphorylase gene (PYGL).
Many pathogenic variants are known in this gene, and a splice-­site
variant in intron 13 has been identified in the Mennonite population. A
liver biopsy showing elevated glycogen content and decreased hepatic
phosphorylase enzyme activity can also be used to make a diagnosis,
especially in cases with inconclusive genetic results. However, with the
availability of DNA analysis and next-­generation sequencing (NGS)
panels, liver biopsies are usually unnecessary.

Chapter 107 u Defects in Metabolism of Carbohydrates
Treatment

Treatment is symptomatic and aimed at preventing hypoglycemia
while ensuring adequate nutrition. A low-­carbohydrate (45–50% of
total calories), high-­protein (2–3 g protein/kg body weight or 20–25%
of total calories) diet and frequent feeding are effective in preventing
hypoglycemia. Blood glucose and ketones should be monitored routinely, especially during periods of increased activity/illness. Long-­
term follow-­up of these patients is needed to monitor and manage the
complications and to expand the understanding of the natural history
of this disorder.

Type IX Glycogen Storage Disease (Phosphorylase
Kinase Deficiency)

Type IX GSD represents a heterogeneous group of glycogenoses
resulting from deficiency of the enzyme phosphorylase kinase
(PhK), which is involved in the rate-­limiting step of glycogenolysis.
This enzyme has four subunits (α, β, γ, δ), each encoded by different genes differentially expressed in various tissues. Pathogenic
variants in the PHKA1 gene cause muscle PhK deficiency; pathogenic variants in the PHKA2 and PHKG2 genes cause liver PhK
deficiency, and pathogenic variants in the PHKB gene cause PhK
deficiency in liver and muscle. Pathogenic variants in the PHKG1
gene have not been identified.
Clinical manifestations of liver PhK deficiency are usually recognizable within the first 2 years of life and include short stature
and abdominal distention from moderate to marked hepatomegaly.
The clinical severity of liver PhK deficiency varies considerably.
Hyperketotic hypoglycemia, if present, can be mild but may be
severe in some cases. Ketosis may occur even when glucose levels
are normal. Some children may have mild delays in gross motor
development and hypotonia. It is becoming increasingly clear that
GSD IX is not a benign condition. Severe phenotypes are reported,
with liver fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis and HCC, particularly
in patients with PHKG2 variants and also in some patients with
PHKA2 variants. Progressive splenomegaly and portal hypertension are reported secondary to cirrhosis. Interventricular septal
hypertrophy has been reported in a patient with GSD IX β (PHKB
variant). Cognitive and speech delays have been reported in a few
individuals, but it is not clear whether these delays are caused by
PhK deficiency or are coincidental. Renal tubular acidosis has
been reported in rare cases. Unlike in GSD I, lactic acidosis, bleeding tendency, and loose bowel movements are not characteristic.
Although growth is retarded during childhood, normal height and
complete sexual development are eventually achieved. As with
debrancher deficiency, abdominal distention and hepatomegaly
usually decrease with age. Some adults with liver PhK deficiency
are reportedly asymptomatic, although patients at the other end of
the spectrum develop cirrhosis and liver failure. Further studies are
needed to fully assess and understand the natural history of this
disorder in adults.
Phenotypic variability within each subtype is being uncovered with
the availability of molecular testing. The incidence of all subtypes of
PhK deficiency is approximately 1:100,000 live births.

Type IX α2 Glycogen Storage Disease (X-­Linked Liver
Phosphorylase Kinase Deficiency, PHKA2 Variant)

Glycogen storage disease IX α2 is one of the most common forms of
liver glycogenosis in males. A typical presentation for this condition
includes a young male (age 1-­5 years) with growth stunting, incidental
finding of hepatomegaly, and mild delays in motor development. In
addition to the liver, enzyme activity can also be deficient in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and fibroblasts, with normal enzyme activity in muscle. Cholesterol, triglycerides, and liver enzymes are elevated. Ketosis
may occur after fasting. Lactate and uric acid levels are normal. Hypoglycemia can range from mild to severe. The response in blood glucose to glucagon is normal. Although hepatomegaly and liver enzymes
might gradually reduce and normalize with age in some patients, other
groups exhibit an increase in these disease parameters comparable

905

to those observed in patients with GSD IX γ 2. Most adults achieve a
normal final height. It is increasingly recognized that this disorder is
not benign, as previously thought, and there are patients with severe
disease and long-­term hepatic sequelae. In some cases, liver fibrosis
can occur and progress to cirrhosis. Liver histology shows glycogen-­
distended hepatocytes, steatosis, fibrosis, and/or cirrhosis. Fibrous
septal formation and low-­grade inflammatory changes may be seen.
Adenomas have been also reported.
The gene for the common liver isoform of the PhK α subunit,
PHKA2, is located on the X chromosome (Xp22.2). Pathogenic variants in the PHKA2 gene account for 75% of all PhK cases. X-­linked
liver PhK deficiency is further subdivided into two biochemical subtypes: XLG1, with measurable deficiency of PhK activity in both blood
cells and liver, and XLG2, with normal in vitro PhK activity in blood
cells and variable activity in the liver. The mechanism through which
XLG2 exhibits normal or increased in vitro PhK activity is unknown.
Because of X-­inactivation leading to variable expression of the mutant
allele, some female carriers may develop symptoms ranging from mild
hepatomegaly to more severe symptoms.

Type IX β Glycogen Storage Disease (Autosomal
Liver and Muscle Phosphorylase Kinase Deficiency,
PHKB Variant)

PhK deficiency in liver and blood cells with an autosomal recessive
mode of inheritance has been reported. Similar to the X-­linked form,
chief symptoms in early childhood include hepatomegaly and growth
retardation. Some patients also exhibit muscle hypotonia. In a few
cases where enzyme activity has been measured, reduced PhK activity
has been demonstrated in muscle. Pathogenic variants are found in
PHKB (chromosome 16q12-­q13), which encodes the β subunit, and
result in liver and muscle PhK deficiency (GSD IX β). Several nonsense and missense variants, a single-­base insertion, splice-­site pathogenic variants, and a large intragenic pathogenic variant have been
identified.

Type IX γ2 Glycogen Storage Disease (Autosomal
Liver Phosphorylase Kinase Deficiency, PHKG2
Variant)

This form of PhK deficiency is caused by pathogenic variants in the
testis/liver isoform (TL) of the γ2 subunit of the PHKG2 gene. In contrast to GSD IX α2, patients with GSD IX γ2 typically have more severe
phenotypes, with recurrent hypoglycemia, prominent hepatomegaly,
significant liver fibrosis, and progressive cirrhosis. Hepatic adenomas
have been observed in several patients. Liver involvement occasionally
presents with cholestasis, bile duct proliferation, esophageal varices,
and splenomegaly. The spectrum of involvement continues to evolve
as more cases are recognized. Many pathogenic variants in the PHKG2
gene have been identified.

Diagnosis

Individuals with liver PhK deficiency usually have ketotic hypoglycemia, elevated transaminases, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol,
normal uric acid and lactic acid concentrations, and normal glucagon
response. PhK deficiency may be diagnosed by demonstration of the
enzymatic defect in affected tissues. Hepatic PhK activity can be measured in liver, leukocytes, and erythrocytes. The interpretation of PhK
activity results is complicated by the possibility of both false-­positive
and false-­negative results. False-­positive findings are possible, owing
to the labile nature of PhK, which is extremely sensitive to handling
circumstances and temperature exposure. As a result, extreme caution
is required when storing and transporting such diagnostic specimens.
Because the PhK enzyme has several isozymes, the diagnosis can easily be missed without the tissue where it is deficient (liver, muscle, or
cardiac studies).
Molecular genetic testing is preferable to enzyme assay for diagnosis,
as liver biopsy is an invasive procedure. Gene sequencing is used for
diagnostic confirmation and subtyping of GSD IX. The PHKA2 gene
encoding the α subunit is most frequently involved, followed by the
PHKB and PHKG2 genes encoding the β and γ subunits, respectively.

906 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment for liver PhK deficiency is symptomatic and includes a
high-­protein (2-­3 g protein/kg body weight or 20–25% of total calories) diet with complex carbohydrates (45–50% of total calories) and
small, frequent feedings to prevent hypoglycemia. Cornstarch can be
administered, with symptom-­dependent dosage and timing (0.6-­2.5 g/
kg every 6 hours). Hypoglycemia should be treated with oral glucose, if
tolerated; if not, IV glucose should be given.
Patients with pathogenic variants in the γ subunit typically have
a more severe clinical course with progressive liver disease. In liver
biopsy samples, hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis was detected in 50% and
95% of patients with PHKA2 and PHKG2 pathogenic variants, respectively. Two patients with GSD IX γ2 received liver transplantation, one
for liver failure secondary to cirrhosis and the other for HCC. Liver
involvement needs to be monitored in all patients with GSD IX by periodic imaging (abdominal ultrasound or MRI every 6-­12 months) and
serial hepatic function tests.

Type 0a Glycogen Storage Disease (Liver Glycogen
Synthase Deficiency)

Liver glycogen synthase deficiency type 0a (GSD 0a) is caused by
deficiency of hepatic glycogen synthase activity, leading to a marked
decrease of glycogen stored in the liver. It is caused by pathogenic variants in GYS2. The disease appears to be rare in humans and, in the
true sense, is not a type of GSD because the enzyme deficiency leads
to decreased glycogen stores. Patients present in infancy with early-­
morning (pre-­breakfast) drowsiness, pallor, emesis, and fatigue, and
occasional convulsions associated with hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia. Blood lactate and alanine levels are low, and there is no hyperlipidemia or hepatomegaly. Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, lactic acidosis,
and hyperalaninemia, with normal insulin levels after administration
of glucose or a meal, suggest a deficiency of glycogen synthase. Diagnosis may be through molecular testing that identifies pathogenic variants in GYS2 or by liver biopsy to measure the enzyme activity.
Treatment consists of frequent meals rich in protein and nighttime
supplementation with uncooked cornstarch to prevent hypoglycemia
and hyperketonemia. Most children with GSD 0a are cognitively and
developmentally age appropriate. Short stature and osteopenia are
common features. The prognosis seems good for patients who survive
to adulthood, with a decrease in the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia. Long-­term natural history studies are required to have a better understanding of the disease’s outcomes and the impact of dietary
therapy.

Hepatic Glycogenosis with Renal Fanconi Syndrome
(Fanconi-­Bickel Syndrome)

Fanconi-­Bickel syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused
by defects in the facilitative GLUT2, which transports glucose in and
out of hepatocytes, pancreatic β cells, and the basolateral membranes
of intestinal and renal epithelial cells. The disease is characterized by
proximal renal tubular dysfunction, impaired glucose and galactose
utilization, and accumulation of glycogen in the liver and kidney.
The affected child typically presents in the first year of life with failure to thrive, rickets, and a protuberant abdomen from hepatomegaly
and nephromegaly. The disease may be confused with GSD I because
a Fanconi-­like syndrome can also develop in that patient population.
Adult patients have short stature as a result of hypophosphatemic rickets. Patients are more susceptible to fractures because of early-­onset
generalized osteopenia. In addition, intestinal malabsorption and diarrhea may occur, and HCC has been seen. Laboratory findings include
glucosuria, phosphaturia, generalized aminoaciduria, bicarbonate
wasting, hypophosphatemia, increased serum alkaline phosphatase
levels, and radiologic findings of rickets. Mild fasting hypoglycemia
and hyperlipidemia may be present. Liver transaminase, plasma lactate, and uric acid levels are usually normal. Oral galactose or glucose
tolerance tests show intolerance, which could be explained by the functional loss of GLUT2 preventing liver uptake of these sugars. Tissue
biopsy results show marked accumulation of glycogen in hepatocytes
and proximal renal tubular cells, presumably from the altered glucose

transport out of these organs. Diffuse glomerular mesangial expansion,
along with glomerular hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria similar to
nephropathy in GSD Ia, and diabetes have been reported.
This condition is rare, and 70% of patients with Fanconi-­Bickel
syndrome have consanguineous parents. Most patients have homozygous pathogenic variants; some patients are compound heterozygotes. Several types of pathogenic variants in the SLC2A2 gene have
been described, including missense, nonsense, insertion/deletion, and
intronic variants.
There is no specific treatment. Symptom-­dependent treatment with
phosphate, bicarbonate, and uncooked cornstarch can result in growth
improvement. Growth may also improve with symptomatic replacement of water, electrolytes, and vitamin D and restriction of galactose
intake; a diet similar to that used for diabetes mellitus, with small, frequent meals using complex carbohydrates and adequate caloric intake,
is recommended.

MUSCLE GLYCOGENOSES

The role of glycogen in muscle is to provide substrates for the generation
of ATP for muscle contraction. The muscle GSDs are broadly divided
into two groups. The first group is characterized by hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, progressive skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy,
or both and includes deficiencies of acid α-­glucosidase, a lysosomal
glycogen-­
degrading enzyme (type II GSD); lysosomal-­
associated
membrane protein 2 (LAMP2/Danon disease); AMP-­activated protein kinase γ2 (PRKAG2/PRKAG2 syndrome); and muscle glycogen
synthase (type 0b). Glycogenin-­
1 deficiency (GYG1/polyglucosan
body myopathy 2) may manifest as muscle weakness and exercise
intolerance to exercise in the absence of cardiomyopathy.
The second group comprises muscle energy disorders characterized
by muscle pain, exercise intolerance, myoglobinuria, and susceptibility
to fatigue. This group includes myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle
disease, type V GSD) and deficiencies of phosphofructokinase (type
VII), phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and muscle-­specific phosphorylase kinase (type IX
α1). Some of these latter enzyme deficiencies can also be associated
with compensated hemolysis, suggesting a more generalized defect in
glucose metabolism.

Type II Glycogen Storage Disease (Lysosomal Acid
α-­1,4-­Glucosidase Deficiency, Pompe Disease)

Pompe disease, also referred to as GSD type II or acid maltase deficiency, is caused by a deficiency of acid α-­1,4-­glucosidase, an enzyme
responsible for the degradation of glycogen in lysosomes. This enzyme
defect results in lysosomal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissues and
cell types, predominantly affecting cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle
cells and the nervous system. In Pompe disease, glycogen typically accumulates within lysosomes, as opposed to its accumulation in cytoplasm
in the other glycogenoses. However, as the disease progresses, lysosomal
rupture and leakage lead to the presence of cytoplasmic glycogen as well.
Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. The incidence
was previously reported to be approximately 1 in 40,000 live births
in Whites and 1 in 18,000 live births in the Han Chinese population.
Newborn screening for Pompe disease in the United States suggests
that the prevalence is much higher than previously thought (between
1 in 10,000 and 1 in 25,000). More than 600 pathogenic variants have
been identified in the gene for acid α-­glucosidase (GAA) and are helpful in delineating the phenotypes. A splice-­site variant (c.-32-13 T > G,
formerly called IVS1-13 T > G) is commonly seen in White patients
with late-­onset disease.

Clinical Manifestations

Pompe disease is broadly classified into infantile and late-­onset forms.
The infantile presentation is a continuum and is further divided into
two categories: classic and nonclassic. Classic infantile Pompe disease (IPD) is uniformly lethal without enzyme replacement therapy
(ERT) with alglucosidase alfa. Affected infants present in the first days
to weeks of life with hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness with a
hypotonic floppy infant appearance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Chapter 107 u Defects in Metabolism of Carbohydrates
with or without left ventricular outflow obstruction, feeding difficulties, macroglossia, and hepatomegaly; if untreated, the condition leads
to death from cardiorespiratory failure or respiratory infection by 1
year of age. Nonclassic IPD has a slower disease course and a less severe
cardiac phenotype at initial presentation.
Late-­
onset Pompe disease (LOPD; juvenile-­
, childhood-­
, and
adult-­onset disease) is characterized by proximal limb girdle muscle
weakness and early involvement of respiratory muscles, especially
the diaphragm. The distinguishing feature between IPD and LOPD
is absence of cardiomyopathy in the first year of life in patients with
LOPD. Symptoms related to progressive dysfunction of skeletal muscles can start within the first year of life to as late as the sixth decade.
The clinical picture is dominated by slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, with truncal involvement and greater involvement of the
lower limbs than the upper limbs. The pelvic girdle, paraspinal muscles, and diaphragm are the muscle groups most seriously affected in
patients with LOPD. Cardiac involvement can occur and ranges from
cardiac rhythm disturbances to cardiomyopathy. Other symptoms may
include lingual weakness, ptosis, and dilation of blood vessels (e.g.,
basilar artery, ascending aorta). With disease progression, patients
become confined to a wheelchair and require artificial ventilation. The
initial symptoms in some patients may be respiratory insufficiency
manifested by somnolence, morning headache, orthopnea, and exertional dyspnea, which eventually lead to sleep-­disordered breathing
and respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is the cause of significant
morbidity and mortality in LOPD. Basilar artery aneurysms with rupture also contribute to mortality in some cases. Small-­fiber neuropathy
presenting as painful paresthesia has been identified in some LOPD
patients. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as postprandial bloating,
dysphagia, early satiety, diarrhea, chronic constipation, and IBD have
been reported. Genitourinary tract involvement is not uncommon and
may present as bladder and bowel incontinence, weak urine stream, or
dribbling. If untreated, the age of death varies from early childhood to
late adulthood, depending on the rate of disease progression and the
extent of respiratory muscle involvement. With the advent of ERT, a
new natural history is emerging for survivors of both IPD and LOPD.

Laboratory Findings

Pertinent laboratory findings include elevated levels of serum creatine
kinase (CK), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),
and LDH. Urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4), a glycogen breakdown
metabolite, is a reliable biomarker for gauging disease severity and progression, as well as treatment response. Levels of Glc4 are extremely
elevated in patients with IPD. In the infantile form, a chest x-­ray film
showing massive cardiomegaly is frequently the first symptom detected.
Electrocardiographic findings include a high-­voltage QRS complex,
Wolff-­Parkinson-­White (WPW) syndrome, and a shortened PR interval. Echocardiography reveals thickening of both ventricles and/or the
intraventricular septum and/or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Dilated cardiomyopathy and a low ejection fraction have also
been reported. Muscle biopsy shows the presence of vacuoles that stain
positively for glycogen; acid phosphatase is increased, presumably from
a compensatory increase of lysosomal enzymes. EM reveals glycogen
accumulation within a membranous sac and with disease progression
also in the cytoplasm. EMG reveals myopathic features with excessive
electrical irritability of muscle fibers and pseudomyotonic discharges.
Serum CK is not always elevated in adult patients. Depending on the
muscle sampled or tested, the muscle histologic appearance and electromyography may not be abnormal. Some patients with infantile Pompe
disease who had peripheral nerve biopsies demonstrated glycogen
accumulation in the neurons and Schwann cells.

Diagnosis

A diagnosis of Pompe disease can be made by either enzyme assay in
dried blood spots, leukocytes, blood mononuclear cells, muscle, or
cultured skin fibroblasts demonstrating deficient acid α-­glucosidase
activity or gene sequencing showing two pathogenic variants in the
GAA gene. The enzyme assay should be done in a laboratory with
experience using maltose, glycogen, or 4-­methylumbelliferyl-­α-­d-­glu

907

copyranoside (4MUG) as a substrate. In fibroblast enzyme assays, the
infantile form has a more severe enzyme deficiency (less than 1% of
that in normal controls) than the late-­onset forms (between 1% and
30% of that in normal controls). Blood-­based assays, especially dried
blood spots, have the advantage of being quick and noninvasive and
are increasingly being used as the first-­line sample to make a diagnosis.
The presence of the neutral α-­glucosidase isoenzyme, which interferes
with acid glucosidase, was formerly considered to be a disadvantage
in blood-­based assays. However, the addition of an inhibitor to this
isozyme, acarbose, improves the assay’s reliability by blocking isoenzyme activity. A muscle biopsy is often done with suspected muscle
disease and a broad diagnostic differential, as it yields faster results
and provides additional information about glycogen content and site
of glycogen storage within and outside the lysosomes of muscle cells.
However, a normal muscle biopsy, especially in patients with LOPD,
does not exclude a diagnosis of Pompe disease. Late-­onset patients
show variability in glycogen accumulation in different muscles and
within muscle fibers, and muscle histology and glycogen content can
vary depending on the site of muscle biopsy. Because of the high risk
of complications, anesthesia in infantile cases with significant cardiomyopathy should be reserved for situations where it is necessary. Availability of NGS panels and whole exome or genome sequencing allow
for identification of additional patients with Pompe disease, especially
when the diagnosis is ambiguous. GAA enzyme activity can be measured in chorionic villi or amniocytes for prenatal diagnosis; however,
if the familial pathogenic variants are known, molecular genetic testing
is the recommended approach.

Treatment

ERT with recombinant human acid α-­glucosidase (alglucosidase alfa
and avalgluco) is available for treatment of Pompe disease. Recombinant acid α-­glucosidase can prevent deterioration or reversing abnormal cardiac and skeletal muscle functions (Fig. 107.3). ERT should be
initiated as soon as possible across the disease spectrum, especially for
infants with the infantile form, because the disease is rapidly progressive. Infants who are negative for cross-­reacting immunologic material
(CRIM) (i.e., infants that have no detectable GAA on a Western blot),
develop a high-­titer antibody against the infused enzyme and respond
to ERT less favorably. A subset of CRIM-­positive patients (presence of
some protein on a Western blot) can also develop high and sustained
antibody titers to ERT. Treatment using immunomodulating agents
such as methotrexate, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) have demonstrated efficacy in preventing the development of
an immune response to ERT and immune tolerance. Nocturnal ventilatory support, when indicated, should be used. It has been shown to
improve the quality of life and is particularly beneficial during a period
of respiratory decompensation. In addition to ERT, other adjunctive
therapies have demonstrated benefit in patients with Pompe disease.
For patients with late-­onset disease, a high-­protein, low-­carbohydrate
diet may be beneficial. Respiratory muscle strength training has demonstrated improvements in respiratory parameters when combined
with ERT. Submaximal aerobic exercise regimens are beneficial in
improving muscle strength, pain, and fatigue.
A second-­generation ERT, avalglucosidase alfa (NeoGAA), has been
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of individuals with LOPD older than 1 year of age. Mannose-­6-­
phosphate (M6P) is more abundant in NeoGAA than in alglucosidase alfa,
which improves enzyme uptake into cells. Improvements in respiratory
function (forced vital capacity [FVC]) and 6-­minute walk test (6MWT) in
patients with LOPD have been shown by phase 1/2 and 3 trials.
There are other therapies in development for Pompe disease, including intravenous cipaglucosidase alfa (a novel recombinant human GAA
with high bis-­M6P content; functions as substrate reduction therapy),
miglustat (an oral chaperone; functions as enzyme stabilizer), small-­
molecule therapy, and gene therapy.
Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary for optimal outcomes.
Newborn screening using blood-­based assays in Taiwan and 28 U.S.
states has resulted in early identification of Pompe cases, and thus
improved disease outcomes, through the early initiation of ERT.

Danon Disease

Danon disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the LAMP2 gene,
which leads to a deficiency of lysosomal-­associated membrane protein
2 (LAMP2). This disorder is inherited in an X-­linked dominant pattern.
Defects in LAMP2 lead to accumulation of glycogen in the heart and
skeletal muscle, presenting primarily as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
and skeletal muscle weakness. Danon disease can be distinguished from
the usual causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (defects in sarcomere-­
protein genes) by the electrophysiologic abnormalities, particularly
ventricular preexcitation and conduction defects. Patients present with
cardiac symptoms, including chest pain, palpitations, syncope, and cardiac arrest, usually between ages 8 and 15 years. Other clinical manifestations include peripheral pigmentary retinopathy, lenticular changes,
abnormal electroretinogram, and mild cognitive dysfunction. Diagnosis
can be established by molecular testing of the LAMP2 gene. The prognosis for LAMP2 deficiency is poor, with progressive end-­stage heart failure
early in adulthood. Treatment is directed toward management of symptoms in affected individuals, including management of cardiomyopathy,
correction of arrhythmias, and physical therapy for muscle weakness.
Cardiac transplantation has been successful in some patients. In male
patients with Danon disease, a nonrandomized open-­label phase 1 study
(NCT03882437) is currently being conducted to assess the safety of gene
therapy using recombinant adeno-­associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)
containing the human lysosome-­associated membrane protein 2 isoform
B (LAMP2B) transgene.

PRKAG2 Syndrome (Adenosine Monophosphate
[AMP]–Activated Protein Kinase γ2 Deficiency)

PRKAG2 syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants in the PRKAG2
gene that is required for the synthesis of the enzyme AMP-­activated
protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates cellular pathways involved
in ATP metabolism. PRKAG2 syndrome has an autosomal dominant
pattern of inheritance. Common presentations include hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and electrophysiologic abnormalities such as WPW

syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and progressive atrioventricular block.
Cardiac involvement is variable and includes supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, and sudden
cardiac death in some cases. In addition to cardiac involvement, there
is a broad spectrum of phenotypic presentations including myalgia,
myopathy, and seizures. Cardiomyopathy caused by PRKAG2 variants usually allows for long-­term survival, although a rare congenital form presenting in early infancy is associated with a rapidly fatal
course. Cardiomyopathy in PRKAG2 syndrome often mimics that in
other conditions, especially Pompe disease, and should be considered
as a differential diagnosis in infants presenting with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treatment is primarily symptomatic, including
management of cardiac failure and correction of conduction defects.
Patients with PRKAG2 deficiency are at risk for sudden cardiac death
and require close monitoring.

Type 0b Glycogen Storage Disease (Muscle Glycogen
Synthase Deficiency)

Muscle glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD 0b) results from biallelic loss-­
of-­function pathogenic variants in the gene GYS1. In the true sense, this
is not a type of GSD because the enzyme deficiency leads to decreased
glycogen stores in skeletal and cardiac muscles. The disease is extremely
rare and has only been reported in five cases. Muscle biopsies showed
lack of glycogen, predominantly oxidative fibers, and mitochondrial
proliferation. Glucose tolerance testing was normal. The phenotype
was variable and ranged from sudden cardiac arrest, muscle fatigability, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rate, and hypotension
while exercising to mildly impaired cardiac function at rest.

Type XV Glycogen Storage Disease (Glycogenin-­1
Deficiency, Polyglucosan Body Myopathy 2, GYG1
Variant)

Chapter 107 u Defects in Metabolism of Carbohydrates
gene disrupting glycogenin-­1 biosynthesis. There is a reduced or complete absence of glyogenin-­1, which is a precursor necessary for glycogen formation. Polyglucosan accumulation in skeletal muscles causes
juvenile-­or adult-­onset proximal muscle weakness, prominently affecting the hip and shoulder girdles. Some patients were noted to have a
cardiac phenotype. Exertion-induced chest pain, palpitations, and
shortness of breath are common early symptoms. Changes in electrophysiological (ECG) parameters and impairment of left ventricular
function were reported. Heart transplantation may be necessary in
some cases. The missense variant c.304G>C (p. Asp102His) has been
observed in homozygosity in the majority of these patients. Compared
with GSD IV–APBD, nervous system involvement is uncommon,
although polyglucosan deposition is seen in both disorders. Muscle
biopsies show PAS-­
positive, diastase-­
resistant storage material in
30–40% of muscle fibers. EM reveals the typical polyglucosan structure,
consisting of an ovoid form composed of partly filamentous material.

Type V Glycogen Storage Disease (Muscle Phosphorylase Deficiency, McArdle Disease)

GSD type V, the prototype of muscle energy disorders, is one of the
most common GSDs with a prevalence of ∼1 in 10,000 and is caused
by deficiency of myophosphorylase activity. Lack of this enzyme limits
muscle ATP generation from glycogenolysis, resulting in muscle glycogen accumulation. A deficiency of myophosphorylase impairs the
cleavage of glucosyl molecules from the straight chain of glycogen.

Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms usually first develop in late childhood or in the second
decade of life. Studies have shown that McArdle disease can manifest
in individuals as old as in their seventh decade and in infancy in a
fatal, early-­onset form characterized by hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, and respiratory complications. Symptoms are generally
characterized by exercise intolerance with muscle cramps and pain
and are precipitated by two types of activity: (1) brief, high-­intensity
exercise, such as sprinting or carrying heavy loads and (2) less intense
but sustained activity, such as climbing stairs or walking uphill. Most
patients can perform moderate exercise, such as walking on level
ground, for long periods. Many patients experience a characteristic
second-­wind phenomenon, with relief of muscle pain and fatigue after
a brief period of rest. An increased blood flow of glucose derived from
either endogenous liver glycogenolysis or exogenous glucose and free
fatty acids, which may be used as an alternative energy source by the
exercising muscles, causes the second-­wind phenomenon. As a result
of the underlying myopathy, these patients may be at risk for statin-­
induced myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Although patients typically
experience episodic muscle pain and cramping from exercise, up to
35% of patients with McArdle disease report permanent pain that has a
serious impact on sleep and other activities.
Approximately 50% of patients report burgundy-­colored urine after
exercise as a result of exercise-­induced myoglobinuria secondary to
rhabdomyolysis. Excessive myoglobinuria after intense exercise may
precipitate acute renal failure.
Laboratory findings include elevated serum CK levels at rest, which
further increase after exercise. Exercise also elevates the levels of blood
ammonia, inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid, which may be attributed to accelerated recycling of muscle purine nucleotides caused by
insufficient ATP production.

Diagnosis

Type V GSD is an autosomal recessive disorder. Testing of the gene for
muscle phosphorylase (PYGM) helps confirm the diagnosis of GSD V. A
common nonsense variant, c.148C>T (p.Arg50Ter) in exon 1, is found
in 80% of White patients; deletion of a single codon, c.2128_2130del
(p.Phe710del) in exon 17, is found in 61% of patients of Japanese origin. The c.148C>T (p.Arg50Ter) variant represents 55% of alleles in
patients of Spanish descent, and the c.2392T>C (p.Trp798Arg) and
c.613G>A (p.Gly205Ser) variants represent 10% and 9% of pathogenic
alleles in this population. Muscle biopsy can be used to measure glycogen content and enzyme activity in cases where genetic testing results

909

are inconclusive. Lack of an increase in blood lactate levels and exaggerated blood ammonia elevations suggest a defect in the conversion of
muscle glycogen or glucose to lactate. An ischemic exercise test offers
rapid diagnostic screening for patients suspected to have McArdle disease, though it should be noted that an abnormal response is not limited
to type V GSD, as other muscle defects in glycogenolysis or glycolysis
produce similar results (deficiencies of muscle phosphofructokinase,
phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, or LDH). Additionally, such testing was also associated with severe complications and
false-­positive results. A nonischemic forearm exercise test with high
sensitivity that is easy to perform and is cost-­effective has been deemed
a more appropriate diagnostic tool; however, it also cannot differentiate
abnormal exercise responses due to type V disease from other defects
in glycogenolysis or glycolysis.

Treatment

To enhance patients’ outcomes and physical activity capacity, a
multidisciplinary team approach to care composed of a physician,
physiotherapist, psychologist, clinical nurse, and dietitian is advised.
Avoidance of strenuous exercise prevents symptoms; regular and moderate exercise is recommended to improve exercise capacity. Patients
are advised to take advantage of the second-­wind phenomenon by
commencing exercise slowly and to slow down or stop if muscle weakness or discomfort, increased heart rate, or increased respiratory effort
occurs. This slow-­pause-­resume pattern is intended to be maintained as
needed until considerable improvement in physical activity tolerance
occurs.
High-­dose oral ribose, glucagon, verapamil, vitamin B6, a high-­
protein diet, branched-­chain amino acid supplementation, dantrolene
sodium, high-­dose creatine, intravenous gentamicin, and intralipid
infusion treatments showed no benefit according to a revised and
updated systematic review in the Cochrane Database of nutritional and
pharmacologic trials for GSD V. Oral sucrose ingestion before exercise,
a carbohydrate-­rich diet, ramipril, and low-­dose creatine were treatments that showed some promise. There is ongoing research regarding
the benefits of a low-­carbohydrate ketogenic diet in patients with type
V GSD.

Type VII Glycogen Storage Disease (Muscle Phosphofructokinase Deficiency, Tarui Disease)

Type VII GSD is caused by pathogenic variants in the PFKM gene,
which result in a deficiency of muscle phosphofructokinase enzyme.
This enzyme is a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and is necessary for the ATP-­dependent conversion of fructose-­6-­phosphate to
fructose-­1,6-­diphosphate. Phosphofructokinase is composed of three
isoenzyme subunits according to the tissue type, encoded by different
genes: (PFKM [M: muscle], PFKL [L: liver], and PFKP [P: platelet]).
Skeletal muscle has only the M subunit, whereas red blood cells (RBCs)
express a combination of L and M forms. In type VII GSD, the M isoenzyme is defective, resulting in complete deficiency of enzyme activity
in muscle and a partial deficiency in RBCs.
Type VII GSD is an autosomal recessive disorder with increased
prevalence in individuals of Japanese ancestry and Ashkenazi Jewish background. A splicing defect and a nucleotide deletion in PFKM
account for 95% of pathogenic variants in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Diagnosis based on molecular testing for the common variants
is possible in this population.

Clinical Manifestations

Although the clinical picture is similar to that of type V GSD, the following features of type VII GSD are distinctive:
• Exercise intolerance, which usually commences in childhood, is
more severe than in type V disease and may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe muscle pain. Vigorous exercise causes severe muscle cramps and myoglobinuria.
• Compensatory hemolysis occurs, as indicated by an increased level
of serum bilirubin and an elevated reticulocyte count.
• Hyperuricemia is common and exaggerated by muscle exercise to a
greater degree than that observed in type V GSD.

910 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
In addition to normal glycogen, GSD VII is characterized by the
accumulation of polyglucosan bodies. The accumulation of glucose-­6-­
phosphate caused by PFKM deficiency and the inhibition of glycolysis
stimulate the glycogen synthase enzyme, resulting in the formation of
polyglucosan bodies.
Exercise intolerance is especially worse after carbohydrate-­
rich
meals because the ingested glucose prevents lipolysis, thereby depriving muscle of fatty acid and ketone substrates. This is called the out-­
of-­wind phenomenon, in contrast to patients with type V disease who
can metabolize blood-­borne glucose derived from either endogenous
liver glycogenolysis or exogenous glucose. Indeed, glucose infusion
improves exercise tolerance in patients with type V disease.
The second-­wind phenomenon is absent because of the inability to
break down blood glucose.
Several rare type VII presentations have been described. One form
presents in infancy with hypotonia and limb weakness and proceeds to
a rapidly progressive myopathy that leads to death by 4 years of age. A
second type occurs in infancy and results in congenital myopathy and
arthrogryposis, with a fatal outcome. A third form presents in infancy
with hypotonia, mild developmental delay, and seizures. An additional
presentation is hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia; although
these patients do not experience muscle symptoms, it remains unclear
whether these symptoms will develop later in life. Another group of
individuals with asymptomatic partial red cell PFK deficiency has been
described. One phenotype presents in adults and is characterized by
a slowly progressive, fixed muscle weakness rather than cramps and
myoglobinuria. It may also cause mitral valve thickening from glycogen buildup. Myopathy and hemolysis are hallmarks of the classic form.

established, patients with the diagnosis should be monitored for developmental concerns.
The gene for the muscle γ subunit (PHKG1) is on chromosome
7p11.2, and no pathogenic variants in this gene have been reported
to date.

Diagnosis

107.2 Defects in Galactose Metabolism

To establish a diagnosis, gene sequencing can identify pathogenic variants in the PFKM gene. Demonstration of the enzymatic deficiency
in muscle may be required in some cases. The absence of the M isoenzyme of phosphofructokinase can also be demonstrated in muscle,
blood cells, and fibroblasts.

Treatment

Strenuous exercise should be avoided to prevent acute episodes of muscle cramps, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, and compartment syndrome. Continuous blood pressure monitoring or compressive devices,
as well as the use of tourniquets, are contraindicated in these patients.
Patients with GSD VII should follow the same slow-­pause-­resume routine as those with GSD V. Dietary therapy for GSD VII has not been
thoroughly investigated. A ketogenic diet has been reported to show
clinical improvement in a patient with GSD VII. Carbohydrate meals
and glucose infusions have demonstrated worsening symptoms because
of the body’s inability to use glucose. The administered glucose tends to
lower the levels of fatty acids in the blood—a primary source of muscle
fuel. Drugs such as statins should be avoided. Precautionary measures
should be taken to avoid hyperthermia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia,
and shivering while undergoing anesthesia in both GSD V and GSD VII.

Type IX α1 Glycogen Storage Disease (Muscle-­
Specific Phosphorylase Kinase Deficiency, PHKA1
Variant)

X-­linked muscle PhK deficiency (IX α1 GSD) is caused by pathogenic
variants in the PHKA1 gene, which encodes a muscle-­specific regulatory subunit (α subunit) of phosphorylase kinase and is located on
Xq13.11. The condition is male-­predominant, but affected heterozygous females have been reported. Patients generally present with mild to
severe exercise intolerance in childhood or adolescence. Most patients
have elevated serum CK and, in more involved cases, myoglobulinuria.
There is no evidence of hepatic or cardiac disease in these patients.
Blood phosphorylase kinase enzymatic activity is normal, and the
enzyme activity is decreased to deficient in the muscle. Muscle biopsy
reveals subsarcolemmal accumulations of glycogen, and some patients
have myopathic changes on EMG. One patient has been described with
comorbid muscle PhK deficiency and intellectual disability; although a
connection between PHKA1 and neurodevelopment has not yet been

Other Muscle Glycogenoses with Muscle Energy
Impairment

Five additional defects in enzymes—phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK),
phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), LDH, fructose-­1,6-­bisphosphate
aldolase (aldolase A), and β-­enolase in the pathway of the terminal
glycolysis—cause symptoms and signs of muscle energy impairment
similar to those in types V and VII GSD. Deficiency in PGAM, enolase,
or LDH causes a myopathic phenotype marked by exercise-­induced
cramps and myoglobinuria. Patients with aldolase A or PGK deficiencies may present with hemolytic anemia in conjunction with myopathy.
The failure of blood lactate to increase in response to exercise is a useful screening test and can be used to differentiate muscle glycogenoses
from disorders of lipid metabolism, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency and very long-­chain acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, which also cause muscle cramps and myoglobinuria. Muscle
glycogen levels can be normal in the disorders affecting terminal
glycolysis, and molecular testing or muscle enzyme activity assay is
needed to make a definitive diagnosis. There is no specific treatment
(see preceding “Treatment” section).

Milk and dairy products contain lactose, the major dietary source
of galactose. The metabolism of galactose produces fuel for cellular metabolism through its conversion to glucose-­1-­phosphate (see
Table 107.1). Galactose also plays an important role in the formation
of galactosides, which include glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans. Galactosemia is a term that refers to an abnormally
high quantity of galactose in the blood. It can be caused by one of
four distinct inborn defects in galactose metabolism involving one of
the following enzymes: galactose mutarotase (GALM), galactokinase
(GALK), galactose-­1-­phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), and uridine diphosphate galactose-­4-­epimerase (GALE). Among these, the
most serious defect is severe GALT deficiency or classic galactosemia,
which is frequently referred to as galactosemia.

GALACTOSE-­1-­PHOSPHATE URIDYL TRANSFERASE
DEFICIENCY GALACTOSEMIA

Two forms of the deficiency exist: infants with complete or near-­
complete deficiency of the enzyme (classic galactosemia) and those
with partial transferase deficiency. Classic galactosemia is a serious
disease with onset of symptoms typically by the second half of the first
week of life. The incidence is approximately 1 in 60,000 live births. The
newborn infant receives high amounts of lactose (up to 40% in breast
milk and certain formulas), which consists of equal parts of glucose
and galactose. Without the transferase enzyme, the infant is unable to
metabolize galactose-­1-­phosphate, the accumulation of which results
in injury to the liver, kidney, and brain. This injury may begin prenatally in the affected fetus by endogenous fetal production of galactose.

Clinical Manifestations

The diagnosis of uridyl transferase deficiency should be considered in
newborn or young infants with any of the following features within a few
days or weeks after birth: jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, hypoglycemia, seizures, lethargy, irritability, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain or
failure to regain birthweight, and aminoaciduria. Untreated children may
show nuclear cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, hepatic failure, cirrhosis,
ascites, splenomegaly, or intellectual disability. Patients with galactosemia

Chapter 107 u Defects in Metabolism of Carbohydrates
are at increased risk for Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis; the onset of sepsis often precedes the diagnosis of galactosemia. Pseudotumor cerebri has
been reported in some patients, presenting with failure to thrive and a
bulging anterior fontanel. Complete withdrawal of lactose from the diet
results in improvement of the acute symptoms. If untreated, death from
liver failure and sepsis may follow within days. When the diagnosis is not
made at birth, damage to the liver (cirrhosis) and brain (intellectual disability) becomes increasingly severe and irreversible.
Partial transferase deficiency is classified into two subtypes: clinical variant galactosemia (erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is ≥1% of
controls, but not more than 10–15%) and biochemical (Duarte) variant
galactosemia (erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is ≥25% of controls).
Partial transferase deficiency is more common than classic galactosemia and is diagnosed in the newborn screening setting because of
moderately elevated blood galactose and/or low transferase activity.
Clinical variant galactosemia should be considered in the newborn or
young infant who is not thriving or who exhibits any of the classical
galactosemia-­related symptoms. Generally, biochemical (Duarte) variant galactosemia is asymptomatic. There is no evidence that individuals
with biochemical (Duarte) variant galactosemia have an increased risk
of neurodevelopmental problems or premature ovarian insufficiency.
Additional research is required to properly understand and describe
the natural history of this subtype.

Diagnosis

Historically, the detection of a reducing substance in several urine specimens obtained when the patient is on a diet containing human milk,
cow’s milk, or any other lactose-­containing formula was regarded as
strongly indicative of galactosemia. The clue was detecting a reducing
substance in urine by Clinitest strips (e.g., glucose, galactose) that is
negative by Clinistix (which is specific for glucose only). Galactose can
also be identified by chromatography or an enzymatic test specific for
galactose. Galactose can be detected in urine, provided the milk feeding
was within the last few hours and the child is not vomiting excessively.
The addition of galactosemia to the newborn screening panel resulted
in a considerable reduction in the utility of Clinitest strips for galactosemia screening. Amino acids may be detected in urine (aminoaciduria)
because they are excreted together with glucose as a result of proximal
renal tubular dysfunction. Because galactose is injurious to persons with
galactosemia, diagnostic challenge tests dependent on administering
galactose orally or intravenously should not be used. Direct enzyme assay
using erythrocytes establishes the diagnosis. The clinician must confirm
that the patient did not receive a blood transfusion before the collection of the blood sample for enzyme assay activity in RBCs, because this
may lead to a false-­negative result, and the diagnosis could be missed.
The activity of galactose-­1-­phosphate uridyl transferase in erythrocytes
can be measured in a variety of ways, one of which involves the use of
a nonradioactive assay using high-­performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) separation and ultraviolet (UV) light detection. Patients with
glucose-­6-­phosphate-­dehydrogenase deficiency can have false-­positive
results. In classic galactosemia, metabolites (urinary galactitol, red cell
galactose-­1-­phosphate, and blood galactose concentration) may be elevated and can be used to confirm the diagnosis and monitor the response
to dietary changes and metabolic control.

Genetics

GALT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic
variants in the GALT gene. Based on newborn screening in the United
States, the frequency of the disease is approximately 1 in 47,000 live births.
There are several enzymatic variants of galactosemia. More than 327
pathogenic variants have been associated with GALT deficiency. The most
common pathogenic variants that result in classic galactosemia phenotype
are c.563A>G (p.Gln188Arg), c.855G>T (p.Lys285Asn), and c.584T>C
(p.Leu195Pro). In Whites, the p.Gln188Arg variant is linked to an
increased incidence of severe disease, premature ovarian insufficiency, and
speech problems in a homozygous state. In Blacks p.Ser135Leu is common,
which results in a milder phenotype (clinical variant galactosemia) despite
the absence of measurable GALT activity in erythrocytes. These patients
retain 10% of enzyme activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa. When

911

treated early, Blacks who are homozygous for this variant are not at risk
for neonatal E. coli sepsis or chronic complications (i.e., premature ovarian insufficiency and language delay). Four pathogenic variants are unique
to the Duarte variant (D2): a four–base pair (bp) deletion in the GALT
promoter region (c.-­119-­116delGTCA), a c.378-­27G>C, a c.508-­24G>A,
and a c.507+62G>A. A fifth variant is a single amino acid substitution
(c.940A>G, p.Asn314Asp, also called N314D), which has been observed
in both the Duarte variant and functionally normal GALT alleles. Individuals heterozygous for Duarte variant galactosemia typically have 25%
of normal galactose activity. Symptoms are minimal or absent, metabolites
range from elevated to normal, and there is no need for intervention. Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis can be performed by molecular testing
or, less commonly, direct enzyme assay on amniocytes or chorionic villi.

Treatment and Prognosis

Consensus guidelines recommend treating patients with an RBC
GALT enzyme activity of ≤10% and erythrocyte galactose-­1-­phosphate
concentration of >10 mg/dL. The decision of whether to treat those
with 10–15% RBC residual GALT activity is still a matter of debate.
All galactose-­containing foods should be removed from the diet on
initial suspicion of galactosemia. Various non–lactose-­containing milk
substitutes are available (casein hydrolysates, soybean-­based formula).
A galactose-­restricted diet, along with adequate calcium and vitamin
D supplementation, reverses growth failure and hepatic dysfunction.
Cataracts regress, and most patients have no persistent impairment of
vision. Early diagnosis and treatment have improved the prognosis of
galactosemia. On long-­term follow-­up, patients still manifest ovarian
failure with primary or secondary amenorrhea, decreased bone mineral density, developmental delay, and learning disabilities that increase
in severity with age. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is reported in
80–90+% of female patients with classic galactosemia. Although most
females with classic galactosemia are infertile when they reach childbearing age, a small number have given birth. Females with the Duarte
variant galactosemia and who are homozygous for p.Ser135Leu do not
develop premature ovarian insufficiency. Most patients manifest speech
disorders, whereas a smaller number demonstrate poor growth and
impaired motor function and balance (with or without overt ataxia).
Strict dietary restriction and relative control of galactose-­1-­phosphate
levels do not always correlate with long-­term outcome, leading to the
belief that other factors such as elevated galactitol, decreased uridine
diphosphate galactose (a donor for galactolipids and proteins), and
endogenous galactose production may be responsible.

GALACTOKINASE DEFICIENCY

The deficient enzyme is galactokinase, which normally catalyzes the phosphorylation of galactose. The principal metabolites accumulated are galactose and galactitol. Two genes encode enzymes with galactokinase activity,
GALK1 and GALK2, although pathogenic variants have been noted only
in GALK1 that cause autosomal recessive galactokinase deficiency. Cataract is the most common manifestation of galactokinase deficiency, and
pseudotumor cerebri is a rare complication. The incidence of hypoglycemia and infection is comparable to those found in the general population.
There is a higher rate of bleeding diathesis, encephalopathy, and elevated
liver transaminases than in the general population during the newborn
period. Some patients have intellectual impairment and motor and language delays. Heterozygous carriers may be at risk for presenile cataracts.
Laboratory findings include increased concentration of blood galactose
levels and urinary galactitol, provided the infant has been fed a lactose-­
containing formula. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating an absence
of galactokinase activity in erythrocytes or fibroblasts. GALT activity is
normal. Treatment is dietary restriction of galactose.

URIDINE DIPHOSPHATE GALACTOSE-­4-­EPIMERASE
DEFICIENCY

There are three distinct forms of epimerase deficiency based on the
level of enzyme activity in different cell types. The first is a benign
form known as peripheral epimerase deficiency galactosemia, diagnosed
incidentally through newborn screening programs. Affected individuals are asymptomatic because the enzyme deficiency is limited to

912 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
leukocytes and erythrocytes. This form does not require treatment. The
second subtype is called intermediate form and is caused by epimerase
deficiency in RBCs and circulating white blood cells, as well as epimerase activity below 50% of normal in all other cells. Neonates with the
intermediate form are typically asymptomatic, even when fed a normal
milk diet, and are diagnosed only as a result of newborn screening.
The long-­term consequences remain unknown. During infancy and
early childhood, these individuals are treated with a galactose-­/lactose-­
restricted diet. The third form is rarer and more severe as a result of
generalized epimerase deficiency. Clinical manifestations resemble
GALT transferase deficiency, with additional symptoms of hypotonia
and nerve deafness. Clinical symptoms improve with restriction of
galactose/lactose in the diet. Although this severe form of epimerase
galactosemia is rare, it must be considered in a symptomatic patient
with elevated RBC galactose-­
1-­
phosphate, urinary galactose, and
galactitol levels but with normal GALT transferase activity. The abnormally accumulated metabolites are similar to those in transferase deficiency, with the addition of an increase in cellular uridine diphosphate
(UDP) galactose. Biochemical diagnosis is confirmed by the assay
of epimerase in erythrocytes demonstrating reduced activity. UDP
galactose-­4-­epimerase is encoded by the GALE gene, and pathogenic
biallelic variants result in autosomal recessive disease. Carrier detection is possible by measurement of epimerase activity in the erythrocytes. Prenatal diagnosis for the severe form of epimerase deficiency
can be done using an enzyme assay of cultured amniotic fluid cells or
testing of known familial pathogenic variants.
Patients with the severe form of epimerase deficiency cannot synthesize UDP galactose from UDP glucose and are galactose dependent.
Because galactose is an essential component of many nervous system
structural proteins, patients are placed on a galactose-­restricted diet
rather than a galactose-­free diet. Galactose restriction is also indicated
for infants and young children with the intermediate form. Additional
outcome data are needed to optimize these approaches and develop
a better understanding of long-­term issues in this patient population.
Infants with mild epimerase deficiency have not required treatment.

Galactose Mutarotase Deficiency

GALM catalyzes the first step in the Leloir pathway, the conversion of
beta-­D-­galactose to alpha-­D-­galactose. There have been a few cases
of GALM deficiency reported, with an overall estimated incidence
of GALM deficiency in all populations of less than 1 in 200,000, with
higher incidences in Black and Japanese populations. Apart from cataracts, individuals with GALM deficiency are often healthy. In some
reported cases, elevated blood galactose-­1-­phosphate (Gal-­1-­P) and
galactose levels were identified during newborn screening. There are
no reports of long-­term implications of this condition and no formal
recommendations regarding optimal dietary intake in this population.

107.3 Defects in Fructose Metabolism
Ghada Hijazi and Priya S. Kishnani
Two inborn errors are known in the specialized pathway of fructose
metabolism: benign or essential fructosuria and hereditary fructose
intolerance. Fructose-­
1,6-­
bisphosphatase deficiency, not formally a
defect of the specialized fructose pathway, is discussed in Chapter 107.4.

DEFICIENCY OF FRUCTOKINASE (ESSENTIAL OR
BENIGN FRUCTOSURIA)

Deficiency of fructokinase is not associated with clinical manifestations. Fructosuria is an incidental finding identified in asymptomatic
individuals with reducing substances in urine. No treatment is necessary, and the prognosis is excellent. Inheritance of this autosomal
recessive trait is caused by biallelic variants in the KHK gene, with an
incidence of 1 in 120,000 live births.

Fructokinase catalyzes the first step of metabolism of dietary fructose—conversion of fructose to fructose-­1-­phosphate (see Fig. 107.1).
Without this enzyme, fructose consumption results in a rise in the blood
level of fructose, which is partially excreted in the urine, as there is little to
no renal threshold for fructose. In adipose tissue and muscle, hexokinase
converts the remainder to fructose-­6-­phosphate, which is considered a
slower alternative process. Clinitest results reveal the urinary reducing
substance, which can be identified as fructose by chromatography.

DEFICIENCY OF FRUCTOSE-­1-­PHOSPHATE ALDOLASE (ALDOLASE B, HEREDITARY FRUCTOSE
INTOLERANCE)

In comparison to fructokinase, deficiency of fructose-­1-­phosphate
aldolase (aldolase-­B) is a severe condition in infants resulting from
a deficiency of activity in the liver, kidney, and intestine. Fructose-­1-­
phosphate aldolase hydrolyzes fructose-­1-­phosphate to glyceraldehyde
and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In the glycolytic-­
gluconeogenic
pathway, this enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-­
1,6-­
bisphosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde
phosphate. In the absence of aldolase B activity, there is a rapid accumulation of fructose-­1-­phosphate and depletion of ATP, which presents with severe symptoms when fructose-­containing food is ingested.
Accumulation of fructose-­1-­phosphate also results in inhibition of
gluconeogenesis (via inhibition of aldolase A) and glycogenolysis (via
inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase A), resulting in decreased glucose production and a rapid decline in blood glucose. Because isozyme
fructose-­1,6-­bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase A) metabolizes fructose-­
1,6-­bisphosphate, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are not affected in
patients with hereditary fructose intolerance in the fasting state.

Epidemiology and Genetics

The incidence of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is estimated to
be as high as 1 in 26,000 live births. HFI is inherited in an autosomal
recessive manner because of biallelic pathogenic variants in the ALDOB
gene. At least 60 pathogenic variants causing HFI are known. The most
common pathogenic variant identified in the Northern European population is p.Ala150Pro. This variant, along with two other missense variants (p.Ala175Asp and p.Asn335Lys), account for 80–85% of HFI cases
in Europe and the United States. The diagnosis of HFI can be made by
gene sequencing or demonstration of hepatic fructose-­
1-­
phosphate
aldolase (aldolase B) activity deficiency on liver biopsy (uncommon).

Clinical Manifestations

Affected individuals remain asymptomatic until fructose, sucrose
(table sugar), or sorbitol is introduced in the diet (usually from fruit,
fruit juice, or sweetened cereal). Signs and symptoms typically manifest
in infancy when foods or formulas containing these sugars are introduced. Certain patients are very sensitive to fructose, whereas others
can tolerate moderate intake (up to 250 mg/kg/day). Early clinical manifestations resemble galactosemia and include jaundice, hepatomegaly,
vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and convulsions. There may also be a
higher incidence of celiac disease in patients with HFI (>10%) compared with the general population (1–3%). With age, affected individuals typically develop an aversion to fructose-­containing foods because
of associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Characteristic laboratory findings include lactic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypermagnesemia. A prolonged
prothrombin time, hypoalbuminemia, elevation of bilirubin and transaminase levels, and proximal tubular dysfunction are also seen. Acute
fructose ingestion produces symptomatic hypoglycemia as a result of
impaired gluconeogenesis, with higher intakes causing a more severe
clinical picture. Chronic ingestion results in failure to thrive and hepatic
disease. If the intake of fructose persists, hypoglycemic episodes recur,
leading to progressive renal and hepatic failure and eventually death.

Diagnosis

The presence of a reducing substance in urine during an acute episode
raises the possibility of HFI. Oral fructose challenge is no longer considered a diagnostic approach because of the high risk to the patient,

who can become acutely ill after the test. A definitive diagnosis is made
by demonstration of two pathogenic variants in ALDOB on molecular
genetic testing. A common pathogenic variant (p.Ala150Pro) accounts
for 53% of HFI alleles worldwide. An alternative approach to diagnosis is to demonstrate deficient hepatic fructose-­1-­phosphate aldolase
(aldolase B) activity on liver biopsy. Carbohydrate-­deficient transferrin
(CDT) testing (see Chapter 107.7) is generally abnormal in patients
with HFI and can be used to monitor fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol
consumption in the diet.

or to carbon dioxide and water via the mitochondrial enzymes of the
Krebs cycle. Figure 107.4 depicts the relevant metabolic pathways. Type
I GSD, fructose-­1,6-­bis phosphatase deficiency, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase deficiency are disorders of gluconeogenesis associated
with lactic acidosis. Other metabolic disorders, including mitochondrial respiratory chain defects, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
deficiency, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, defects of fatty acid oxidation, organic acidurias (see Chapters 105.6, 105.10, and 106.1), biotin
synthesis, and utilization defects also can cause lactic acidosis (Table
107.2). Some of these disorders are easily distinguishable by the presence of an abnormal acylcarnitine profile, amino acids in the blood,
and urine organic acids. Blood lactate, pyruvate, acylcarnitine profile,
and urine organic acids should be ordered in infants and children with
unexplained acidosis, especially if there is an increased anion gap.
Lactic acidosis unrelated to an enzymatic defect occurs in conditions associated with hypoxemia and/or hypoperfusion (type A
lactic acidosis). In this case, and in defects in the respiratory chain,
the serum pyruvate concentration may remain normal (<1.0 mg/dL,
with increased lactate to pyruvate ratio), whereas pyruvate is usually
increased when lactic acidosis results from an enzymatic defect in gluconeogenesis or pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (both lactate and
pyruvate are increased, and the ratio is normal). Lactate and pyruvate
should be measured in the same blood specimen and on multiple blood
specimens obtained when the patient is symptomatic because lactic
acidosis can be intermittent. Figure 107.5 is an algorithm for the differential diagnosis of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is also noted with
various underlying diseases (type B1) and drugs or toxins (type B2)
(see Table 107.2).

Treatment

Acute episodes are managed symptomatically by correcting hypoglycemia with IV glucose (dextrose) administration, providing supportive treatment of hepatic and/or renal insufficiency, and correcting
metabolic acidosis. Complete elimination of fructose usually rapidly
reverses symptoms and results in normalization of related metabolic
disturbances. The cornerstone of long-­term treatment is the complete
restriction of all sources of fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol from the diet.
It may be difficult because these sugars are widely used additives, found
even in many medicinal preparations. With treatment, liver and kidney dysfunction improve, and catch-­up in growth is common. Intellectual development is usually unimpaired. As the patient matures,
symptoms become milder even after fructose ingestion, and the long-­
term prognosis is good. Because of voluntary dietary avoidance of
sucrose, affected patients have few dental caries. Care should be taken
to avoid fructose-­containing IV fluids during hospitalizations. Regular
supplementation with a “sugar-­free” multivitamin is required to avoid
micronutrient deficiencies resulting from reduced fruit and vegetable
consumption.

seizures, and coma. In about half of the cases, the deficiency presents in the first week of life. In certain cases, variable degrees of liver
impairment (elevated liver tests) and/or failure have been documented, requiring supportive therapy, including intravenous glucose infusion. In infants and small children, hypoglycemia and/or
hepatopathy-­like episodes are triggered by fasting or missing meals,
febrile infections, gastroenteritis, vomiting, and/or poor oral intake.
The frequency of these episodes decreases with age. Laboratory findings include low blood glucose, high lactate, glycerol, and uric acid
levels and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Because of the inability
of current biochemical assays for plasma triglycerides to differentiate glycerol from triglycerides, FBP deficiency is usually associated
with elevated triglyceride levels. This phenomenon is referred to as
pseudo-­hypertriglyceridemia because the plasma has a high concentration of glycerol rather than triglycerides. In contrast to HFI, there
is usually no oral aversion to sweets and fruit. Between episodes,
renal tubular and liver function may be normal; however, long-­term
studies are limited.
The diagnosis is established by noninvasive molecular genetic testing for pathogenic variants or demonstrating an enzyme deficiency in
either liver biopsy or mononuclear white blood cells. The gene coding for fructose-­1,6-­bisphosphatase is FBP1, and pathogenic variants
are known, making carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis possible.
Treatment of acute attacks consists of correction of hypoglycemia
and acidosis by IV glucose infusion, and the response is usually rapid.
Avoidance of fasting, frequent feedings, aggressive management of
infections, and restriction of fructose, sucrose, glycerol, and/or sorbitol
from the diet can prevent further episodes. For long-­term prevention
of hypoglycemia, a slowly released carbohydrate such as cornstarch
is useful. Children remain asymptomatic in between crises, and the
majority have normal growth and psychomotor development. A few
children have been documented to have suffered brain injury and/
or cognitive disabilities, most likely as a result of early and untreated
hypoglycemia.

Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Deficiency

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. It catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide (see Fig. 107.4). PEPCK deficiency
may occur as a cytosolic or mitochondrial enzyme deficiency, as it is
encoded by two distinct genes (PCK1 and PCK2, respectively).
PEPCK deficiency has been reported in only a few cases. The clinical features are heterogeneous, with hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia,
hepatomegaly, hypotonia, developmental delay, and failure to thrive
as the major manifestations. There may be multisystem involvement,
with neuromuscular deficits, hepatocellular damage, renal dysfunction, and cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis is based on the reduced
activity of PEPCK in the liver, fibroblasts, or lymphocytes. Fibroblasts
and lymphocytes are not suitable for diagnosing the cytosolic form of
PEPCK deficiency because these tissues possess only mitochondrial
PEPCK. PEPCK deficiency can also occur as a secondary phenomenon
caused by other disease, such as mitochondrial depletion disorders. As
a result, molecular testing confirming the presence of two pathogenic
variants in either the PCK1 or PCK2 gene is the recommended gold
standard for diagnosis. To avoid hypoglycemia, patients should receive
treatment with slow-­release carbohydrates such as cornstarch, and
fasting should be avoided.

DISORDERS OF PYRUVATE METABOLISM

Pyruvate is formed from glucose and other monosaccharides, from
lactate, and from alanine. It is metabolized through four main enzyme
systems: LDH, ALT, pyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Deficiency of the M subunit of LDH causes exercise
intolerance and myoglobinuria (see Chapter 107.1).

Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency

After entering the mitochondria, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-­CoA
by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and then enters the
tricarboxylic acid cycle for ATP production. The complex comprises

915

three functional enzymes: E1, an α-­ketoacid decarboxylase; E2, a dihydrolipoyl acyltransferase; and E3, a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. The
complex also contains an E3-­binding protein (previously called protein X) and PDHC kinase and phosphatase, which regulate the complex’s activity via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Additionally, it
requires thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), lipoic acid, and flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD) as cofactors. The E1 subunit, which is made up of
two subunits, E1α and E1β, catalyzes the first and rate-­limiting step in
the reaction. The most common disorder is caused by a gene defect in
the E1α subunit (see Fig. 107.4).
Deficiency of the PDHC is the most common of the disorders leading to lactic acidemia and CNS anomalies and dysfunction. The CNS
dysfunction occurs because the brain obtains its energy primarily from
oxidation of glucose through glycolysis. Brain acetyl-­CoA is synthesized almost exclusively from pyruvate.
PDHC deficiency is mostly caused by pathogenic variants in the
gene coding for the E1α subunit, which is inherited in an X-­linked
dominant fashion; therefore both males and females with a pathogenic
variant exhibit features.

Clinical Manifestations

PDHC deficiency has a wide spectrum of presentations, from the most
severe neonatal presentation to a mild late-­onset form. The neonatal onset is associated with lethal lactic acidosis, white matter cystic
lesions, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and severe enzyme deficiency.
Infantile/childhood onset can be lethal or associated with psychomotor delay and chronic lactic acidosis, cystic lesions in the brainstem
and basal ganglia, and features of Leigh syndrome (see later and
Chapter 638.2). Late onset cases, including males, may have less acidosis, greater enzyme activity, and episodic ataxia upon consumption
of high-­carbohydrate-­containing foods. Intelligence in affected males
may be normal. Developmental delay, hypotonia, hypertonia, seizures,
ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, dystonia, dyskinesia, and/or hemiplegia
are among neurologic symptoms of PDHC deficiency. Patients of all
ages may have dysmorphic facial features, resembling those seen in
fetal alcohol syndrome, as a result of PDHC inhibition and reduction of
energy metabolism in the latter. Typically, patients with E1β deficiency
are more severely affected.
The E2 deficiency is rare and results in a milder phenotype with varying brain MRI findings and survival into adolescence and adulthood.
The E3 lipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency leads to reduced activity not only in the PDHC but also in the α-­ketoglutarate and branched-­
chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. This deficiency is more
common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Individuals deficient in
E3 may present with hypotonia and lactic acidosis during infancy, and
affected infants typically die during the first few years of life. Surviving
children have been shown to have growth delay and severe neurologic
problems. Hepatic disease could be a component of this phenotype
or may manifest separately. Only a small number of patients exhibit
a myopathic phenotype including muscle weakness and elevated CK.
In urine organic acid analysis, α-­ketoglutarate and branched-­chain
ketoacids can be detected, and plasma amino acid analysis may reveal
elevated levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and allo-­isoleucine. These
findings depend greatly on the phenotype of the disease. The E3 binding protein deficiency can present with either neonatal lactic acidosis,
severe psychomotor retardation, or seizure, as well as abnormalities on
brain MRI. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase and kinase deficiencies have also been reported. These other PDHC defects have clinical manifestations within the variable spectrum associated with PDHC
deficiency caused by E1α deficiency.

Treatment

The general prognosis is poor, except in rare patients whose variants
are associated with altered affinity for thiamine pyrophosphate because
they may respond to thiamine supplementation. Because carbohydrates can aggravate lactic acidosis, a ketogenic diet is recommended.
The ketogenic diet has been found to decrease blood lactate levels and
to reduce seizures and improve ataxia and sleep habits. Modified ketogenic diets (a 1:1 fat-­to-­carbohydrate and protein ratio) have also been

916 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
helpful in patients who cannot tolerate a strict ketogenic diet. Infusions of glucose, lactated Ringer, or other drugs known to increase
the risk of lactic acidosis, such as metformin, are contraindicated. A
potential treatment strategy is to maintain any residual PDHC in its
active form by oral administration of dichloroacetate, an inhibitor of
E1 kinase. Beneficial effects of controlling postprandial lactic acidosis
have been shown in some patients. Young children generally tolerate dichloroacetate well, but continued exposure is associated with
peripheral neuropathy, a condition that could be attributable to the
drug or the disease. In vitro studies have demonstrated that phenylbutyrate increases PDC enzyme activity, especially in those with pathogenic variants linked to residual enzyme activity. In patients with E3
deficiency, branched-­chain amino acid restriction and riboflavin
supplementation are recommended.

Deficiency of Pyruvate Carboxylase

Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial, biotin-­containing enzyme
essential in the process of gluconeogenesis; it catalyzes the conversion
of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. The enzyme is also essential for Krebs cycle
function as a provider of oxaloacetate and is involved in lipogenesis
and formation of nonessential amino acids. Clinical manifestations of
this deficiency have varied from neonatal severe lactic acidosis accompanied by hyperammonemia, hypercitrullinemia, hyperlysinemia, and
hypoglycemia (type B) to late-­onset mild to moderate lactic acidosis
and developmental delay (type A). In both types, patients who survive
usually have severe psychomotor retardation with seizures, spasticity,
and microcephaly. Some patients have pathologic changes in the brainstem and basal ganglia that resemble Leigh syndrome. The clinical
severity appears to correlate with the level of the residual enzyme activity. A “benign” form of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency has also been
described, characterized by recurrent attacks of lactic acidosis and
ketoacidosis, as well as mild neurologic deficits (type C). Laboratory
findings include elevated levels of blood lactate, pyruvate, and alanine
and ketonuria. In type B, the lactate-­to-­pyruvate ratio is increased; this
ratio is normal in types A and C. Additionally, in type B, blood ammonia, citrulline, and lysine levels are elevated with low glutamine, which
might suggest a primary anaplerotic defect involving the urea cycle.
The mechanism is likely the result of depletion of oxaloacetate, which
leads to reduced levels of aspartate, a substrate for argininosuccinate
synthase in the urea cycle (see Chapter 105.12). The gene for pyruvate
carboxylase is PC, and many pathogenic variants have been identified.
Diagnosis of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is made by the measurement of enzyme activity in cultured skin fibroblasts or lymphoblasts and must be differentiated from holocarboxylase synthase (HCS)
or biotinidase deficiency. Molecular genetic testing is presently the
preferred approach for diagnosis. Treatment consists of avoidance of
fasting and modifying the diet to include high amounts of carbohydrate and protein. During acute episodes of lactic acidosis, patients
should receive continuous IV glucose. Metabolic abnormalities have
been reduced with the use of anaplerotic compounds such as citrate,
aspartate, or more recently, triheptanoin, but no improvement has
been shown in neurologic symptoms or increased life span. Although
liver transplantation has been shown to correct biochemical abnormalities in two patients, the long-­term benefits of this procedure are still
unknown. Biotin is a cofactor used for this condition, but most patients
do not respond to biotin. Lactated Ringer solution is contraindicated
in this condition because of the theoretical risk of worsening lactic acidosis in these patients.

Deficiency of Pyruvate Carboxylase Secondary
to Deficiency of Holocarboxylase Synthase or
Biotinidase

Deficiency of either HCS or biotinidase, enzymes involved in biotin metabolism and recycling, respectively, results in multiple-­
carboxylase deficiency (pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-­CoA carboxylase,
3-­methyl-­crotonyl-­CoA carboxylase, and propionyl-­CoA carboxylase) and in clinical manifestations associated with the respective
deficiencies, including rash, lactic acidosis, and alopecia (see Chapter
103.6). Both enzyme deficiencies are autosomal recessive disorders.

The incidence of HCS and biotinidase deficiency is approximately 1
in 87,000 and 1 in 80,000 live births, respectively. Ancestry-­specific
pathogenic variants in the HCS and biotinidase (BTD) genes have been
described. Two common pathogenic variants (c.98_104delinsTCC;
p.Cys33PhefsTer36 and c.1612C>T; p.Arg538Cys) in the BTD account
for 52% of all pathogenic alleles in symptomatic patients with biotinidase deficiency.
The course of HCS may be more protracted and less responsive to
therapy than BTD deficiency. Lack of treatment may be associated with
intermittent exacerbations on top of chronic lactic acidosis, failure to
thrive, seizures, and hypotonia leading to spasticity, lethargy, coma, and
death. Auditory and optic nerve dysfunction can lead to deafness and
blindness, respectively. The course of BTD deficiency may be severe if
left untreated. Late-­onset milder forms have also been reported. Laboratory findings include an anion gap metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis,
and abnormal urine organic acids. Lactate, 3-­methylcrotonylglycine,
3-­
hydroxypropionate, 3-­
hydroxisovalerate, and methyl citrate may
accumulate in urine organic acid chromatography (OAC), though the
concentrations of metabolites differ according to the severity of the
enzyme deficiency. Blood and/or urine biotin levels can be used to
evaluate treatment adherence, but they do not contribute to diagnosis. Biotin concentrations in plasma and urine are normal in patients
with HCS deficiency and are often decreased in patients with BTD deficiency, particularly when the assay used does not detect biocytin.
Diagnosis of HCS deficiency and biotinidase deficiency can be
detected through newborn screening tandem mass spectroscopy,
which enables early treatment and improves outcomes. Molecular
genetic testing is required to confirm the diagnosis, which involves the
detection of two pathogenic variants. BTD deficiency can be diagnosed
by reduced enzyme activity in the patient’s serum or plasma, which
helps to classify the deficiency into two categories: profound deficiency (biotinidase activity less than 10% of mean normal serum BTD
activity) and partial deficiency (BTD activity between 10% and 30%
of mean normal serum BTD activity). HCS activity in skin fibroblasts
or lymphocytes can be assessed when HCS deficiency is suspected but
genetic testing is equivocal.

Treatment

Treatment consists of biotin supplementation 5-­20 mg/day and is generally effective if started early before the onset of symptoms or development of brain damage. Newborn screening has facilitated early
treatment for patients with partial or profound BTD deficiency, who
respond well to 5-­10 mg of biotin; some patients may require higher
doses during acute illness. Patients identified through newborn screening and treated with biotin have remained asymptomatic.

Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Defects (Oxidative
Phosphorylation Disease)

The mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the oxidation of fuel
molecules and transfers the electrons to molecular oxygen, with concomitant energy transduction into ATP (oxidative phosphorylation)
(see Chapter 108). The respiratory chain produces ATP from adenosine
diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, using the energy from electrons
transferred from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or flavin
adenine dinucleotide, and includes five specific complexes (I: NADH–
coenzyme Q reductase; II: succinate–coenzyme Q reductase; III:
coenzyme QH2 cytochrome-­c reductase; IV: cytochrome-­c oxidase;
V: ATP synthase). Each complex is composed of 4-­35 individual proteins that are encoded by nuclear or maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, with the exception of complex II, which is encoded solely
by nuclear genes. Alterations of these complexes or assembly systems
produce chronic lactic acidosis, presumably because of a change in the
reduction-­oxidation state with increased concentrations of NADH
(Table 107.3).
In contrast to PDHC or pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, skeletal
muscle and the heart are usually involved in the respiratory chain disorders. On muscle biopsy, ragged red fibers indicating mitochondrial
proliferation are suggestive of mitochondrial involvement when present, especially when observed in young patients with symptoms (see

Fig. 107.5). Because of the ubiquitous nature of oxidative phosphorylation, a defect of the mitochondrial respiratory chain accounts for a vast
array of clinical manifestations and should be considered in patients
of all ages presenting with multisystem involvement. Some deficiencies resemble Leigh syndrome with lactic acidosis, whereas others present with strokelike episodes, myopathies, or ataxia including
MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike
episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers), and

adults with a primary oxidative phosphorylation disease than in the

some instances, combined molecular and functional testing may be
needed (Fig. 107.6). NGS of single or combined mitochondrial DNA
and nuclear gene panels is the preferred method of testing. Whole exome
sequencing with analysis of the mitochondrial genome or whole
genome sequencing may be considered if NGS panel testing is nondiagnostic. Biopsy and genetic analysis of clinically affected tissues,
with or without biochemical testing, is indicated when genetic testing
of blood is negative or inconclusive and there is clinical suspicion of
mitochondrial disease. Muscle biopsy was considered the most reliable
procedure for diagnosing mitochondrial diseases prior to the availability of molecular genetic testing. Muscle histology, including EM, can
detect ragged red fibers and other abnormalities typical of mitochondrial myopathies. Analysis of oxidative phosphorylation complexes
I-­IV from intact mitochondria isolated from fresh skeletal muscle can
be helpful for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders; however, electron transport chain testing of flash-­frozen muscle provides an alternative approach when fresh muscle testing is not available. The presence

of normal muscle biochemistry and histology does not rule out the
possibility of mitochondrial disease. Several disorders, such as defects
in mitochondrial maintenance, fusion/fission, translation, transcription, or abnormalities in mitochondrial membrane integrity or transport, may not manifest with substantial oxidative phosphorylation
deficiency and may have normal muscle biochemistry and histology.
Specific criteria may assist in making a clinical diagnosis (Table 107.4).
One study conducted to reevaluate the clinical utility of mitochondrial
disease criteria (MDC) determined that the criteria are still beneficial
and can aid in directing the diagnostic workup and in interpreting
results and deciding on muscle biopsy in certain instances. Additionally, the study demonstrated that whole exome sequencing might be
used to diagnose patients with lower MDC scores as having primary
mitochondrial disorders. Table 107.5 lists clues to the diagnosis of
mitochondrial diseases.

causative for the majority of mitochondrial disorders are included in

clinical testing panels that are used to diagnose mitochondrial disorders. An important consideration is that many genetic and multifactorial conditions have been associated with defects in one or more of the
four complexes assayed in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
testing; these latter conditions feature so-­called secondary mitochondrial dysfunction because the conditions are not considered to be causative for primary mitochondrial dysfunction.
Treatment remains largely symptomatic and nonspecific and does
not cure or significantly alter the outcome of disease. Mitochondrial
drugs are mainly medicinal/nutritional supplements designed to sustain and boost the mitochondrial residual oxidative phosphorylation
function, while also reducing oxidative stress. Although there is no
consensus on which vitamins and cofactors should be used to treat
mitochondrial disease, the main supplementations used are CoQ10, l-­
carnitine, creatine, alpha-­lipoic acid (ALA), and B vitamins. Additional
medications/supplements are indicated based on the genetic diagnosis
and clinical symptoms of the patient. For example, arginine (IV, oral)
can be prescribed in patients with MELAS for treatment and prevention of metabolic strokes. Citrulline and taurine have also been used
with some success in ongoing clinical trials and case reports demonstrating promising results. Patients with mitochondrial disease should
be encouraged to exercise regularly. Patients with mitochondrial disorders are at a greater risk of developing anesthesia-­related complications. Avoiding prolonged fasting and receiving dextrose-­containing
IV fluids before, during, and after procedures and operations are critical for avoiding catabolism. There are an increasing number of clinical
studies evaluating various therapeutic approaches, including mitochondrial augmentation therapy in pediatric children with Pearson
syndrome (NCT03384420) and AAV gene therapy in individuals with
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (NCT02161380).

neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include pericardial
effusion, cardiomyopathy, renal tubulopathy, liver involvement, hypertrichosis, and muscle weakness. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by
radiologic evidence of symmetric lesions affecting the basal ganglia,
brainstem, and subthalamic nuclei. Patients with Leigh syndrome have
defects in several enzyme complexes. Dysfunction in cytochrome-­c
oxidase (complex IV) is the most commonly reported defect, followed
by NADH–coenzyme Q reductase (complex I), PDHC, and pyruvate
carboxylase (see Chapter 108). Pathogenic variants in the nuclear
SURF1 gene, which encodes an assembly factor involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome-­c oxidase, and mitochondrial DNA variants in
the adenosine triphosphatase 6 (MT-­ATP6) coding region have been
reported in patients with Leigh syndrome in association with complex
IV deficiency. The most common mitochondrial DNA variant in Leigh
syndrome is the m.8993T>G variant in MT-­ATP6. The prognosis for
Leigh syndrome is poor. In a study of 14 cases, there were 7 fatalities
before age 1.5 years. Pathogenic variants in MTFMT had a milder clinical phenotype and disease progression, according to recent research.
Lactic acidosis and encephalopathy have also been reported in
patients with thiamine transporter 2 (THTR2) deficiency and with
pyridoxine-­dependent epilepsy. Thiamine, either alone or in combination with biotin, is required for the treatment of THTR2 deficiency,
whereas pyridoxine is used to treat pyridoxine-­dependent epilepsy.

Leigh Syndrome (Subacute Necrotizing
Encephalomyelopathy)

Approximately 90% of glucose metabolism in the body is generated via
the glycolytic pathway, with the remaining 10% generated via the hexose monophosphate pathway. The hexose monophosphate shunt leads
to the formation of pentose and provides NADPH. One of the metabolites of this alternative pathway is ribose-­5-­phosphate, which is used in
the biosynthesis of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Through
the transketolase and transaldolase reactions, pentose phosphates can
be converted back to fructose-­6-­phosphate and glucose-­6-­phosphate.

Leigh syndrome is a heterogeneous neurologic disease historically
diagnosed based on neuropathologic findings of demyelination, gliosis, necrosis, relative neuronal sparing, and capillary proliferation in
specific brain regions (see Chapter 638.2). Leigh syndrome is characterized by decompensation (neurodevelopmental regression and lactic
acidosis) initiated by viral infection or other metabolic stress. Patients
frequently present with feeding and swallowing problems, failure to
thrive, and developmental delay. The presentation is highly variable
and may include seizures, altered consciousness, movement disorders, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral

autosomal recessive fashion. The urine contains l-­xylulose, which is
excreted in increased amounts because of a block in the conversion of
l-­xylulose to xylitol as a result of xylitol dehydrogenase deficiency.
The condition is usually discovered incidentally in a urine test for
reducing substances. No treatment is required.

TRANSALDOLASE DEFICIENCY

Transaldolase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of
the pentose phosphate pathway. It is more common in Middle Eastern countries and can manifest in three distinct phenotypes. Prenatal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), oligohydramnios, and/or
hydrops fetalis occur with the most severe phenotype. The second is
a neonatal phenotype, where patients may have dysmorphic facial features (triangular-­shaped face, low-­set ears, wide mouth, and thin lips),
cardiovascular abnormalities (ventricular and atrial septal defects),
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly noted in the
newborn period. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction was described
associated with fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, and transplantation of the
liver was indicated in a number of patients. Endocrine abnormalities
(abnormal genitalia, vitamin D insufficiency, hypergonadotrophic

hypogonadism), renal tubulopathy, and skin abnormalities (cutis laxa,
wrinkled skin, capillary hemangioma) have been observed. A third,
milder phenotype is described as presenting later in life. Biochemical abnormalities reveal elevated levels of the polyols arabitol, ribitol,
and erythritol and the seven-­carbon sugars sedoheptitol, perseitol,
sedoheptulose, mannoheptulose, and sedoheptulose-­7P in the urine.
The diagnosis is established with the detection of biallelic pathogenic
variants in the TALDO1 gene. When genetic testing is inconclusive,
low transaldolase activity in lymphoblasts, fibroblasts, and liver tissue
can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The available treatment is symptomatic. Supportive management of the disease manifestations (e.g.,
hepatic dysfunction) is needed. Transplantation of the liver may be
indicated. Regular follow-­up and monitoring for complications such
as anemia and thrombocytopenia is required. N-­acetylcysteine (NAC)
supplementation delayed the progression of disease and restored normal alpha fetoprotein levels in a research trial. Additional long-­term
studies are required to evaluate the broader effectiveness of NAC
supplementation.

RIBOSE-­5-­PHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY

Only four cases of ribose-­5-­phosphatase isomerase deficiency disorder
have been reported. Affected patients may present with psychomotor
delay or regression, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and urine analysis
usually reveal elevated levels of polyols arabitol and ribitol in these
patients. Confirmation of diagnosis is established by identification
of biallelic RPIA pathogenic variants or by enzyme assay in cultured
fibroblasts.

107.6 Disorders of Glycoprotein
Degradation and Structure
Margaret M. McGovern and Robert J. Desnick
The disorders of glycoprotein degradation and structure include several lysosomal storage diseases that result from defects in glycoprotein
degradation and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (see Chapter
107.7). Glycoproteins are macromolecules composed of oligosaccharide chains linked to a peptide backbone. They are synthesized by two
pathways: the glycosyltransferase pathway, which synthesizes oligosaccharides linked O-­glycosidically to serine or threonine residues, and
the dolichol, lipid-­linked pathway, which synthesizes oligosaccharides
linked N-­glycosidically to asparagine.
The glycoprotein lysosomal storage diseases result from the deficiency of the enzymes that normally participate in the degradation of
oligosaccharides and include sialidosis, galactosialidosis, aspartylglucosaminuria, and α-­mannosidosis. In some instances, the underlying
abnormality that leads to glycoprotein accumulation also results in
abnormal degradation of other classes of macromolecules that contain similar oligosaccharide linkages, such as certain glycolipids and
proteoglycans. In these cases the underlying enzymatic deficiency
results in the accumulation of both glycoproteins and glycolipids. The
classification of these types of disorders as lipidoses or glycoproteinoses
depends on the nature of the predominantly stored substance. In general, the glycoprotein disorders are characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance and a progressive disease course with clinical features
that resemble those seen in the mucopolysaccharidoses.

SIALIDOSIS AND GALACTOSIALIDOSIS

Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from the primary deficiency of neuraminidase because of pathogenic variants in
the gene (NEU1) that encodes this protein. In contrast, galactosialidosis is caused by the deficiency of two lysosomal enzymes—neuraminidase and β-­galactosidase. The loss of these enzymatic activities results
from pathogenic variants in a single gene, CTSA, that encodes the

Chapter 107 u Defects in Metabolism of Carbohydrates
protective protein cathepsin A, which functions to stabilize these enzymatic activities. Neuraminidase normally cleaves terminal sialyl linkages of several oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. Its deficiency results
in the accumulation of oligosaccharides and the urinary excretion of
sialic acid terminal oligosaccharides and sialylglycopeptides. Examination of tissues from affected individuals reveals pathologic storage
of substrate in many tissues, including liver, bone marrow, and brain.
The clinical phenotype associated with neuraminidase deficiency
is variable and includes type I sialidosis, which usually presents in
the second decade of life with myoclonus and cherry-­red spots in the
macula. These patients typically present secondary to gait disturbances,
myoclonus, or visual complaints. In contrast, type II sialidosis occurs
at several ages of onset (congenital, infantile, and juvenile), depending on the severity of the gene pathogenic variant. The congenital
and infantile forms result from isolated neuraminidase deficiency,
whereas the juvenile form results from both neuraminidase and β-­
galactosidase deficiency. The congenital type II disease is characterized
by hydrops fetalis, neonatal ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, stippling of
the epiphyses, periosteal cloaking, and stillbirth or death in infancy.
The type II infantile form presents in the first years of life with dysostosis multiplex, moderate global developmental delays, visceromegaly,
corneal clouding, cherry-­red maculae, and seizures. The juvenile type
II form of sialidosis, which is sometimes designated galactosialidosis, has a variable age of onset ranging from infancy to adulthood. In
infancy, the phenotype is similar to that of GM1 gangliosidosis, with
edema, ascites, skeletal dysplasia, and cherry-­red spots. Patients with
later-­onset disease have dysostosis multiplex, visceromegaly, intellectual disability, dysmorphism, corneal clouding, progressive neurologic
deterioration, and cherry-­red spots.
No specific therapy exists for any form of the disease, although studies in animal models have demonstrated improvement in the phenotype after bone marrow transplantation. The diagnosis of sialidosis
and galactosialidosis is achieved by the demonstration of the specific
enzymatic deficiency or by pathogenic variants in the responsible gene.
Prenatal diagnosis using cultured amniotic cells or chorionic villi is
available by demonstrating the enzyme defect and/or specific gene
pathogenic variants.

ASPARTYLGLUCOSAMINURIA

This is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, except
in Finland, where the carrier frequency is estimated at 1 in 36 adults,
the high frequency due to a founder gene. The disorder results from
the deficient activity of aspartylglycosaminidase and the subsequent
accumulation of aspartylglycosamine, particularly in the liver, spleen,
and thyroid. The gene for the enzyme is AGA, and in the Finnish
population, a single AGA pathogenic variant encoding p.Cys163Ser
accounts for most mutant alleles. Outside of Finland, a large number of
private pathogenic variants have been described.
Affected individuals with aspartylglucosaminuria typically present
in the first year of life with recurrent infections, diarrhea, and umbilical
hernias. Coarsening of the facies and short stature usually develop later.
Other features include joint laxity, macroglossia, hoarse voice, crystal-­
like lens opacities, hypotonia, and spasticity. Psychomotor development is usually near normal until age 5 years, when a decline is noted.
Behavioral abnormalities are typically seen, and IQ values in affected
adults are usually <40 (severe intellectual disability). Survival to adulthood is common, with most early deaths attributable to pneumonia or
other pulmonary causes. Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration
of markedly deficient aspartylglucosaminidase in peripheral blood leukocytes and/or the specific AGA pathogenic variant(s). Several patients
have undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplants, but this approach
has not proved effective, and no specific treatment is available. Prenatal diagnosis is available by the determination of aspartylglucosaminidase deficiency and/or the specific AGA pathogenic variants in
cultured amniocytes or chorionic villi.

α-­MANNOSIDOSIS

This autosomal recessive disorder results from the deficient activity of
α-­mannosidase and the accumulation of mannose-­rich compounds.

921

The gene MAN2B1 encodes the enzyme, and to date, >140 gene pathogenic variants have been reported. Affected patients display clinical
heterogeneity. There is a severe infantile form, or type I disease, and a
milder juvenile variant, type II disease. All patients have psychomotor
retardation, facial coarsening, and dysostosis multiplex. The infantile
form of the disorder, however, is characterized by more rapid cognitive deterioration, with death occurring between ages 3 and 10 years.
Patients with the infantile form also have more severe skeletal involvement and hepatosplenomegaly. The juvenile disorder is characterized
by onset of symptoms in early childhood or adolescence, with milder
somatic features and survival to adulthood. Hearing loss, destructive
synovitis, pancytopenia, and spastic paraplegia have been reported in
type II patients. The diagnosis is made by identification of biallelic
pathogenic variants in MAN2B1 and may be supplemented by the
demonstration of the marked deficiency of α-­mannosidase activity
in white blood cells or cultured fibroblasts. Clinical trials of ERT with
recombinant human α-­mannosidase are underway. Prenatal diagnosis can be made by demonstrating the enzyme defect and/or known
pathogenic variants in cultured amniocytes or chorionic villi.

107.7 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation
Eva Morava and Peter Witters
Glycosylation is the complex multistep metabolic process of adding
(oligo)saccharides to macromolecules such as proteins and lipids. The
classification of disorders of hypoglycosylation is based on biochemical structures: (1) defects in protein N-­linked glycosylation, (2) defects
in protein O-­linked glycosylation, (3) defects in glycosphingolipid and
in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-­anchor glycosylation, and (4) defects
in multiple glycosylation pathways and in other pathways (Fig. 107.7).
No disorders are known to result from abnormal C-­linked glycosylation. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are labeled based
on their genetic defect.
Protein glycosylation is an essential process. Most functional
proteins are glycosylated, including serum proteins (e.g., transferrin,
ceruloplasmin, thyroxine-­binding globulin [TBG]), hormones (e.g.,
thyroid-­
stimulating hormone [TSH], follicle-­
stimulating hormone
[FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], adrenocorticotropic hormone
[ACTH], IGFBP3), and clotting and anticoagulation factors (e.g., factors IX and XI, antithrombin). Membrane proteins are also highly glycosylated. Important intracellular glycoproteins include enzymes such
as glycosyltransferases or lysosomal enzymes.
N-­glycans are linked to the amide group of asparagine. They are synthetized in a complicated process throughout the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi complex, starting with sugar activation
and nucleotide sugar synthesis, then oligosaccharide assembly, and
finally glycan processing (see Fig. 107.7). Most of the pediatric glycosylation disorders are the result of N-­glycosylation defects. O-­glycans
are linked to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine. These diverse
glycoproteins are mostly formed in the Golgi complex; their defects
can involve xylosylation, fucosylation, mannosylation, or other modifications. An important focus is O-­mannosylation defects because of
their relevance for dystroglycanopathies.
Lipid glycosylation is an essential process for the synthesis of
ceramide and ganglioside synthesis. Glycosylphosphatidylinositols
(GPIs) are very special glycolipids that link various proteins to the
plasma membrane, as complex lipid-­sugar anchors (GPI anchors, see
Fig. 107.7).
CDGs are predominantly multisystem diseases caused by more
than 150 different genetic defects in glycoprotein and glycolipid glycan synthesis. Most patients described with CDG have N-­glycosylation
defects, followed by the fastest-­growing groups of CDGs, involving
multiple glycosylation pathways and dolicholphosphate synthesis.
Smaller groups are O-­glycosylation disorders and disorders of GPI.
The “oldest” and most common CDG is PMM2-­CDG, in which the

922 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders

Fig. 107.7 Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG): an overview of the currently known subtypes. The picture shows a schematic illustration

of the individual 137 CDG subtypes known to date, designated by the symbol of the affected gene, which are categorized according to the nature
of the biochemical event impaired within the glycosylation pathway. Glycosylation is a complex metabolic process resulting in the attachment of an
oligosaccharide chain of varying length and composition (a glycan) to proteins and lipids. It involves a set of enzyme-­catalyzed reactions that take
place mainly in the cytosol (1.), endoplasmic reticulum (ER; 3.) and Golgi apparatus (4.), after which the newly formed glycoconjugates are, generally,
incorporated into membranes or secreted out of the cell. Depending on how a glycan is linked to the polypeptide backbone, protein glycosylation is
classified into N-­linked (a bond via the amide group of asparagine) or O-­linked (a bond via the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine).
N-­glycoproteins share a common core structure of the glycan, which is first assembled on a dolichol anchor and then transferred onto the protein
in the ER; this is later followed by further modifications of the N-­glycan, removing and adding different monosaccharides, in the Golgi apparatus.
O-­glycosylation consists of a stepwise addition of individual monosaccharide units in the ER and Golgi apparatus, while six subclasses can be distinguished based on which sugar (Man, GalNac, GlcNAc, Glc, Fuc, or Xyl) is the first one attached to the protein, and thus more varied O-­glycan
structures are produced. Other specific types of glycosylation involve lipid glycosylation and the modification of proteins by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The substrates for glycosylation in the form of nucleotide-­monosaccharides are synthesized predominantly in the cytosol,
and because they are used in different glycosylation reactions, their deficiency possibly influences the structure of various glycoconjugates. Similarly,
several defects have been described that affect multiple glycosylation pathways, and, often, other cellular processes might be disturbed as well
(e.g., because of altered ion homeostasis in the Golgi apparatus). ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; COG, conserved
oligomeric Golgi (complex); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Fru-­6-­P, fructose-­6-­phosphate; Fuc, fucose; GalNAc, N-­acetylgalactosamine; Glc, glucose;
GlcNAc, N-­acetylglucosamine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; H+, protons; LLO, lipid-­linked oligosaccharides; Man, mannose; MPI, mannose
phosphate isomerase; PGM1, phosphoglucomutase 1; PMM2, phosphomannomutase 2; UDP, uridine diphosphate; UMP, uridine monophosphate;
Xyl, xylose. (From Ondruskova N, Cechova A, Hansikova H, et al. Congenital disorders of glycosylation: still “hot” in 2020. Biochim Biophys Acta
Gen Subj. 2021;1865[1]:129751, Fig. 1.)

genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2),
the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of mannose-­6-­phosphate
into mannose-­1-­phosphate. The majority of CDGs have an autosomal
recessive inheritance. Only two N-­linked CDGs are autosomal dominant: GANAB-­CDG and PRKCSH-­CDG. The dominantly inherited O-­
linked CDGs include EXT1-­CDG, H63ST-­CDG, and POFUT1-­CDG.
Some CDGs have both an autosomal dominant and recessive phenotype

such as EXT2-­CDG, POGLUT1-­CDG, GNE-­CDG, DHDDS-­CDG,
NUS1-­
CDG, COG4-­

the first 2 years of life. Some patients, however, stabilize throughout

young adulthood. Almost any clinical phenotype can be present in a
patient with CDG. It can affect any organ or organ system and most
often includes the CNS. The most common clinical features include
developmental and speech delay, seizures, ataxia, spasticity, peripheral
neuropathy, hypotonia, strabismus, abnormal fat distribution, visual
loss, cardiomyopathy, feeding difficulties, liver dysfunction, endocrine
abnormalities, bleeding diathesis, and thrombosis (Fig. 107.8 and Table
107.6). Single-­organ presentations are rare in CDGs, although some
do exist, including TUSC3-­CDG and ST3GAL3-­CDG: brain; DHDDS-­
CDG: retina; ALG14-­CDG: neuromuscular junction; POFUT1-­CDG
and POGLUT1-­CDG: skin; SEC23B-­CDG: red cell lineage; EXT1/
EXT2-­CDG: cartilage; and TMEM199-­CDG: liver. Many CDGs are
recognizable syndromes. CDG should be considered in any patient with
a developmental disability or an unexplained clinical condition, especially in multisystem disease with neurologic involvement.
There are also congenital disorders of deglycosylation, including
known lysosomal disorders and a severe neurologic condition caused
by a defective N-­glycanase function (NGLY1 defect).
Laboratory evaluations in most N-­linked CDGs rely on transferrin glycoform analysis in serum or plasma. A common screening
method is called serum transferrin isoelectric focusing (TIEF).

Transferrin isoforms, which are hyposialylated (missing terminal
sialic acid residues), show different cathodal shifts depending on
either missing glycan chains or truncated glycans. A type 1 pattern suggests an early metabolic defect in the cytosolic-­ER–related
glycan synthesis and assembly. A type 2 pattern suggests Golgi-­
related glycan-­processing defects (Fig. 107.9). Isoelectric focusing of apolipoprotein C-­III (IEF apoC-­III), a serum mucine type
O-­g lycosylated protein, can detect some O-­g lycosylation disorders
(combined N-­ and O-­linked glycosylation defects). Mass spectrometry of intact (glycosylated) transferrin in serum is highly
sensitive for mild type 1 glycosylation abnormalities and diagnostic in most CDGs affecting N-­g lycosylation. Mass spectrometry of apoC-­III is useful specifically in type II CDG. Glycomics
by matrix-­assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight
(MALDI-­TOF) can be diagnostic in specific types of CDG (mostly
Golgi related with a type 2 pattern). Dolichol-­linked glycan or
lipid-­linked oligosaccharide (LLO) analysis is a complicated but
sensitive method to detect ER-­related N-­g lycan assembly (CDG
type 1) defects in patient fibroblasts. GPI-­anchor defects can be
suspected based on recurrent elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels in blood.

of any type of CDG, most metabolic centers use a direct CDG
gene panel analysis or NGS (whole exome sequencing) (see
Fig. 107.9).

CONGENITAL DISORDERS OF PROTEIN
N-­GLYCOSYLATION
Phosphomannomutase-­2 Deficiency (PMM2-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

PMM2-­CDG is the most common and easily recognizable CDG.
Over 900 patients have been identified with an estimated incidence of 1:20,000-­1:80,000. Most patients have alternating strabismus, characteristic facial features (short nose, long philtrum,
large ears) (see Fig. 107.8E), inverted nipples and/or abnormal fat
pads (see Fig. 107.8A-­C), feeding difficulties, axial hypotonia, and
decreased reflexes already in the first few months of life. Nystagmus (caused by pontocerebellar and vermis hypoplasia; see Fig.
107.8F) is also common. Psychomotor disability is present in most
patients, but normal intellectual development has been described
in a few patients. Most patients develop a multisystem disease, and
<25% show an isolated neurologic phenotype without other organ
involvement, normal endocrine regulation, and no coagulopathy.
The neurologic involvement is quite diverse, with ataxia, seizures,
spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy (see Fig. 107.8D) the most
common features. Dystonia, strokelike episodes, and proximal
myopathy can also occur. PMM2-­CDG is not a progressive disease,
but certain features, when present, typically appear at a different
age during the disease. From birth, pericardial fluid collection,
cardiomyopathy, or chronic vomiting/diarrhea can occur; after the
age of 7 years, retinitis pigmentosa and cataracts; and after puberty,
scoliosis, neuropathy, and recurrent thrombotic events. Liver function anomalies are mild and usually improve by age, and only a few

patients develop cholestasis or liver fibrosis. Most patients have a
hypergonadotropic hypogonadism; no successful pregnancies have
been reported. Intellectual disability can be mild to severe; speech
development is frequently delayed and can even be absent. Autistic
behavior is common, although most patients have a cheerful personality. The oldest patient is 72 years old.

Pathophysiology

PMM2 catalyzes the conversion of mannose-­6-­phosphate to mannose-­
1-­phosphate and is essential for the formation of activated mannose
units used in the synthesis of the growing glycan chain in the ER.
Hypoglycosylation leads to abnormal function affecting many essential
glycoproteins, such as coagulation and anticoagulation factors; endocrine regulation; transport proteins; liver function; and immune, membrane, and receptor proteins.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method for PMM2-­CDG is serum transferrin
glycoform analysis, which is most frequently performed by TIEF or
mass spectrometry. Intact transferrin has four negatively charged sialic
acid residues (tetrasialotransferrin). Transferrin glycoforms, missing terminal sialic acid residues, show different cathodal shifts, less
abundant tetrasialotransferrin, increased disialotransferrin, and some
a-­sialotransferrin. This is the so-­called type 1 pattern, suggestive of a
defect in glycan assembly in the cytosol-­ER. Transferrin isoforms are
detectable by mass spectrometry, which is a more reliable diagnostic
method compared with TIEF. Certain other disorders can cause a false-­
positive transferrin isoform pattern, including galactosemia, hereditary
fructose intolerance, and excessive alcohol use. PMM enzyme analysis
is available in leukocytes and fibroblasts.

926 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
The presence of elevated serum transaminases, hypoalbuminemia,
decreased factor IX and XI and antithrombin activity, or low ceruloplasmin or TBG level is highly suggestive of CDG, including the most common type, PMM2-­CDG.
PMM2-­CDG is autosomal recessive. Genetic testing is mostly performed by direct sequencing. The most frequent pathogenic variant
(c.422G>A; R141H) is present in 75% of White patients. Prenatal diagnosis is only reliable by genetic testing.

Treatment

The therapy in PMM2-­CDG relies on supportive treatment. Even
with the best treatment, mortality is about 20% in the first 2 years
of life, mostly from cardiac or kidney involvement and severe infections. Recommended therapy includes adequate nutrition, diet or
tube feeding if needed, cardiac support, hormone supplements,
physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, seizure management, and strabismus surgery. Treatment with acetazolamide (7-­17
mg/kg/day) resulted in improvement of ataxia and a decrease in
disease severity (measured by the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG rating
scale). This is likely mediated by the function of the glycosylated
CaV2.1 channel. Possible dehydration, changes in plasma pH, and
bicarbonate levels (renal tubular acidosis) need to be monitored
throughout therapy.
Therapeutic developments include targeted (liposomal) mannose-­
phosphate treatment, drug repurposing, and chaperone therapy; these
are only in early trial phases.

Mannosephosphoisomerase Deficiency (MPI-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

MPI deficiency is a recognizable and treatable CDG. Approximately
35 patients have been published. Most patients show early symptoms
of liver disease (cholestasis, elevated transaminases) and feeding
difficulties, with recurrent vomiting and chronic diarrhea, most frequently with protein-­losing enteropathy. Life-­threatening episodes
might appear as early as the first few months of life with recurrent
thrombosis and severe gastrointestinal bleeding because of severe
coagulation abnormalities. Hypoglycemia is usually caused by hyperinsulinism. Hypoalbuminemia can be severe; patients might develop
visible abdominal distention from a combination of ascites and hepatomegaly. Patients with MPI-­CDG have no other organ involvement,
and the CNS is not affected. There are no dysmorphic features. The
liver disease frequently progresses to fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Pathophysiology

Mannosephosphoisomerase (MPI) catalyzes the conversion of fructose-­
6-­phosphate to mannose-­6-­phosphate, one step before PMM2, therefore
blocking the formation of activated mannose units (GDP mannose) for
oligosaccharide synthesis. Hypoglycosylation leads to abnormal glycoprotein function, the same as in PMM2-­CDG, especially coagulation
and anticoagulation factors, liver function, and hormone receptors.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a suspected MPI-­CDG patient is
serum transferrin isoform analysis by mass spectrometry or screening by TIEF (see Fig. 107.9). MPI deficiency leads to a type 1 pattern,
as seen in PMM2 deficiency. MPI enzyme analysis is available in leukocytes and fibroblasts. The presence of elevated serum transaminases,
hypoalbuminemia, decreased factor IX and XI and antithrombin activity, hyperinsulinism, and nonketotic hypoglycemia are highly suggestive for MPI-­CDG.
MPI-­CDG is autosomal recessive. Genetic testing is mostly performed by direct sequencing. The exact incidence of MPI-­CDG is not
known, but it is estimated at 1 in 800,000 in Europe. Prenatal diagnosis
is only reliable by genetic testing. Although this is a rare CDG, early
diagnosis is imperative because it is treatable.

Treatment

MPI-­CDG is the first CDG type treatable by dietary therapy (Table
107.7). Mannose therapy is clinically effective by both IV and oral
supplementation. The dose of oral mannose is 150-170 mg/kg/dose
for four or five doses per day (maximum dosing 600-1200 mg/kg/
day and maximum of six doses per day). IV mannose should be
used only in life-threatening conditions when oral intake is not possible. The maximum dose of IV mannose is 1 g/kg/day as a continuous infusion, combined with IV glucose to prevent hypoglycemia.
A known side effect is hemolysis. The treatment uses an alternative
pathway: mannose can be phosphorylated by hexokinases to mannose 6-­phosphate, bypassing the MPI defect. The clinical symptoms
improve rapidly, but liver function may further deteriorate. Liver
fibrosis and cirrhosis may necessitate liver transplantation, which
will resolve the metabolic disease. The oldest patient known with
MPI-­CDG has survived into their late 30s.

Glucosyltransferase-­1 Deficiency (ALG6-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

ALG6-­CDG is the second most common CDG. Most patients have
hypotonia, muscle weakness, seizures, and ataxia. No patient with
ALG6-­CDG has been reported with normal intelligence. Speech delay
and nystagmus are common neurologic signs. Brachydactyly, skeletal
abnormalities, and transverse limb defects have been observed. Strabismus and characteristic facial dysmorphism are rare (hypertelorism,
oval face, short nose). Inverted nipples and/or abnormal fat pads are
exceptional in ALG6-­CDG.
The most severe ALG6-­CDG patients show a multisystem phenotype in the first few months of life, including severe infections, protein-­
losing enteropathy, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and failure to thrive.
Autistic behavior and mood changes have been observed in several
patients. The oldest patient to date is almost 50 years old.

Pathophysiology

The metabolic problem is caused by defective binding of the first
of three glucoses to the lipid-­linked oligosaccharide in the ER. This
glucose binding is essential for attachment of the oligosaccharyltransferase enzyme complex to the newly built oligosaccharide
chain and the ability to transfer it to the protein. This leads to protein hypoglycosylation and abnormal glycoprotein function similar
to PMM2-­CDG and MPI-­CDG. Laboratory abnormalities are also
similar, including abnormalities in coagulation and anticoagulation
factors, liver function, thyroid hormones, and immunoglobulins
(IgGs).

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a suspected ALG6-­CDG patient
is serum transferrin glycoform analysis by mass spectroscopy or
TIEF analysis. ALG6 deficiency leads to a type 1 pattern (see Fig.
107.9), as seen in PMM2 and MPI deficiency. There is no available enzyme analysis, although LLOs could be evaluated in patient
fibroblasts.
ALG6-­CDG is autosomal recessive. Genetic testing is mostly performed by direct sequencing. The most common pathogenic variants are p.A333V and p.I299Del. Prenatal diagnosis is only reliable by
genetic testing. The exact incidence of ALG6-­CDG is not known.

Treatment

The current therapy in ALG6-­CDG relies on supportive treatment.
Mortality is about 10% in the first years of life, mostly from protein-­
losing enteropathy and severe infections.

UDP-­GlcNAc:Dol-­P-­GlcNAc-­P Transferase Deficiency
(DPAGT1-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

DPAGT1 deficiency is a recognizable and potentially treatable
CDG. About one third of patients show the congenital myasthenia

phenotype, indistinguishable from other genetic congenital myasthenias. CK levels are normal. These patients have a relatively good
prognosis, especially with early myasthenia therapy. The other
patients show a multisystem phenotype with microcephaly, brain
malformations, hypotonia, severe psychomotor disability, seizures,
spasticity, failure to thrive, joint contractures, and cataracts.

Pathophysiology

The DPAGT1 defect leads to very early arrest of glycan synthesis
outside the ER membrane by slowing the addition of the second
GlcNAc sugar to the phosphorylated dolichol arm. Abnormal
receptor glycosylation in the neuromuscular junction leads to
myasthenia. Hypoglycosylation in the multisystem type leads to

928 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
abnormal glycoprotein function similar to PMM2-­CDG, especially
involving the anticoagulation factors, and interestingly leading to
high serum CK (in contrast to the congenital myasthenia phenotype) and hypoalbuminemia.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method is serum transferrin glycoform analysis by mass spectroscopy or TIEF analysis. Most patients show a type
1 pattern (see Fig. 107.9), but patients with the congenital myasthenia
phenotype can show normal screening. There is no clinically available
enzyme analysis.
DPAGT1-­CDG is autosomal recessive. Genetic testing is mostly
performed by direct sequencing. The exact incidence is not known.
Prenatal diagnosis is only reliable by genetic testing. Because of the
false-­negative TIEF results in several patients with the myasthenic
phenotype, congenital myasthenia panel testing is suggested in suspected cases, especially for determining the potential therapy.

Treatment

The congenital myasthenia phenotype is frequently treatable by high-­
dose pyridostigmine, eventually enhanced with salbutamol and a
potassium channel blocker (amifampridine). In the multisystem phenotype of DPAGT1-­CDG, treatment is supportive.

CONGENITAL DISORDERS OF PROTEIN
O-­GLYCOSYLATION
Cerebro-­Ocular Dysplasia–Muscular Dystrophy and
Muscle-­Eye-­Brain Disease Spectrum (POMT1-­CDG,
POMT2-­CDG, POMGNT1-­CDG)

From isolated muscular dystrophy to Walker Warburg syndrome,
this group of O-­linked glycosylation disorders presents with severe
muscle weakness, congenital eye malformations, and neuronal
migration defects. Pachygyria, cobblestone dysgenesis, hydrocephalus, polymicrogyria, heterotopias, and corpus callosum agenesis are
variably present. Eye malformations include anophthalmia, microphthalmia, congenital cataract, or colobomas. Congenital muscular dystrophy is associated with significant CK elevations. There is
severe psychomotor disability.
The underlying metabolic defect is the abnormal synthesis of the O-­
mannosylglycan core, which is essential for the proper glycosylation
of α-­dystroglycan. The α-­dystroglycan is heavily O-­glycosylated with
mannose residues and is expressed in both muscle and brain. Defective mannosylation of α-­dystroglycan leads to muscle degeneration
and migration defects. Muscle biopsy shows abnormal α-­dystroglycan
staining on immunohistochemistry.
Transferrin glycoform analysis, including TIEF, is normal in patients
with isolated O-­mannosylation defects. There is also no clinically available enzyme analysis. Diagnosis is based on histology (muscle biopsy)
and genetic analysis.
POMT1-­
CDG, POMT2-­
CDG, and POMGNT1-­
CDG are the
most common autosomal recessive α-­dystroglycanopathies. Additional gene defects occur in the pathway; POMK, FKTN, FKRP,
LARGE, B3GALNT2, B4GAT1, DAG1, TMEM5, and ISPD have been
described in association with human disease. The exact incidence of
α-­dystroglycanopathies is not known.
The treatment for α-­dystroglycanopathies is supportive.

DEFECTS IN LIPID GLYCOSYLATION AND IN
GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL ANCHOR
BIOSYNTHESIS
Hyperphosphatasia–Intellectual Disability
Syndromes: PIGA Deficiency (PIGA-­CDG)

This clinically recognizable syndrome is an epilepsy syndrome with
intellectual disability, hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, skin anomalies, congenital brain malformations, and behavioral abnormalities,

including autism. Other organ malformations, including cardiac and
renal defects, have also been reported. Somatic pathogenic variants with
a PIGA defect can also lead to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
N-­acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) cannot be efficiently transferred to
phosphatidylinositol for glycophosphatidylinositol synthesis. Abnormal anchoring of alkaline phosphatase leads to hyperphosphatasemia
in the blood and loss of specific surface antigens on blood cells.
Transferrin isoform analysis is normal in GPI-­anchor defects.
FACS analysis demonstrating reduction of membrane-­
anchored
markers CD16 and CD24 in leukocytes is highly suggestive for a
GPI-­anchor abnormality, especially in association with increased
levels of serum alkaline phosphatase. Pathogenic variant analysis
confirms the defect.
PIGA-­CDG is X-­linked. The exact incidence is not known. A similar
phenotype has been described in PIGO, PIGV, PIGY, PIG, PGAP2, and
PGAP3 defects.
In PIGA-­CDG the treatment is supportive.

DEFECTS IN MULTIPLE GLYCOSYLATION PATHWAYS
AND IN OTHER PATHWAYS, INCLUDING DOLICHOLPHOSPHATE BIOSYNTHESIS DEFECTS
Steroid 5α-­Reductase Deficiency (SRD5A3-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

SRD5A3 deficiency is a clinically recognizable CDG, originally
described as a multiple-­congenital malformation syndrome. About
20 patients have been diagnosed at different ages, including one at
45 years of age. Patients have hypotonia, ataxia, and eye abnormalities, including congenital cataracts, retinal and iridic colobomas,
glaucoma, optic nerve dysplasia, and visual loss. Cerebellar vermis
hypoplasia can be variable. Intellectual disability has been described
in all affected patients thus far. About 30% of patients have severe
congenital ichthyosis. Hypertrichosis and dysmorphic facial features
are common, including squared face, high forehead, large ears, and
coarsening. Some children with SRD5A3-­CDG have a severe autism
spectrum disorder. Skeletal abnormalities (scoliosis) and cardiac
malformations are less common.

Pathophysiology

SRD5A3 deficiency leads to abnormal dolichol synthesis affecting early glycan synthesis outside the ER membrane and affects O-­
mannosylation and GPI-­anchor synthesis. Hypoglycosylation affects
anticoagulation factors and leads to increased serum transaminases.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a suspected SRD5A3-­CDG patient
is serum transferrin glycoform analysis or mass spectroscopy analysis. Most patients show a type 1 pattern (see Fig. 107.9), but several
false-­negative cases have been described. There is no clinically available
enzyme analysis.
SRD5A3-­CDG is autosomal recessive. Genetic testing is mostly
performed by direct sequencing. The exact incidence is not known.
SRD5A3-­CDG treatment is supportive.

Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa Type 2
(ARCL-­2A or ATP6V0A2-­CDG, ATP6V1A-­CDG and
ATP6V1E1-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

ATP6V02-­CDG is a multiple-­malformation syndrome originally
described as cutis laxa syndrome and recently discovered to be a
combined N-­ and O-­linked glycosylation disorder. Patients show
generalized cutis laxa with inelastic, sagging skin at birth, hypotonia, strabismus, myopia, characteristic facial features, and joint
laxity. The facial features include hypertelorism, short nose, long
philtrum, downslanting palpebral fissures with sagging eyelids,
and sagging cheeks. Cardiovascular involvement is rare, and there
is variable CNS involvement. Seizures and motor and language

Chapter 107 u Defects in Metabolism of Carbohydrates
developmental disability are common, but normal intelligence has
been described as well. Sensorineural hearing loss is sometimes
observed. Some patients have vermis hypoplasia, and several children have been described with cobblestone-­like dysgenesis and
partial pachygyria on brain MRI. Skeletal abnormalities and short
stature are common, as are late-­closing fontanels and/or brachydactyly and scoliosis. There is frequently enamel dysplasia. The skin
features spontaneously improve with age. ATP6V1A-­CDG and
ATP6V1E1-­CDG show a highly overlapping phenotype with associated cardiovascular symptoms and hypercholesterolemia.

Pathophysiology

ATP6V0A2 is a membrane subunit of the proton pump of the
vesicular adenosine triphosphatase (V-­ATPase) complex. Abnormal function of the V-­ATPase complex alters the pH gradient in the
secretory pathway and affects the maturation and transport of several glycosyltransferases and elastic fibers (e.g., elastin). ATP6V1A
and ATP6V1E1 are other complex subunits affecting ATP6V0A2
function and cause secondary ATPase deficiency. Both N-­ and O-­
linked glycosylation are affected. There are mild coagulation abnormalities and high serum transaminase levels in some patients.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a suspected ATP6V0A2-­CDG
patient is serum transferrin glycoform analysis by mass spectroscopy or TIEF analysis. Most patients show a type 2 pattern (see Fig.
107.9), but false-­negative cases have been described before the age
of 6 weeks. Apolipoprotein III-­C (apoC-­III) is a mucin-­type secretory glycoprotein that is only O-­glycosylated. ApoC-­III TIEF shows
a hypoglycosylation pattern by mass spectroscopy in patients, even
when the TIEF is falsely negative. Skin biopsies in patients show
classic histologic changes of cutis laxa with diminished, short,
abnormal, and fuzzy elastic fibers.
ATP6V0A2-­CDG is autosomal recessive. Genetic testing is mostly
performed by direct sequencing. The exact incidence is not known.
ATP6V1A and ATP6V1E1 defects have been recently described.

Treatment

In autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2, the treatment is supportive. Fortunately, there is continuous and spontaneous improvement of skin symptoms throughout the disease course, especially in
ATP6V0A2-­CDG.

Golgi-­α1-­2 Mannosidase-­1 Deficiency (MAN1B1-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

The MAN1B1 defect was originally described as an intellectual disability syndrome in association with dysmorphic features. Additional
patients were recognized with psychomotor disability, muscle hypotonia, and inverted nipples in association with truncal obesity. The
degree of intellectual disability is quite variable. Autistic behaviors, eating disorders, and aggressive behavior are frequent features. More than
30 patients have been reported.

Pathophysiology

MAN1B1 codes for a Golgi mannosidase, which is essential for the
final “trimming” of mannose units during the glycan processing in the
Golgi apparatus. Hypermannosylation leads to abnormal, truncated
glycans and CDG-­II. The glycosylation abnormality in serum is relatively mild. Increased serum transaminases and abnormal coagulation
are uncommon.

Diagnosis

Most patients show a mild type 2 pattern by TIEF, but false-­negative
cases have been described. MALDI-­TOF analysis shows characteristic,
hybrid glycans in serum. In suspected cases, direct sequence analysis is
recommended, even if the TIEF is normal.

929

MAN1B1-­
CDG is autosomal recessive. The exact incidence is
unknown; several adult patients are known.

Treatment

Only supportive treatment is available.

Phosphoglucomutase-­1 Deficiency (PGM1-­CDG)
Clinical Manifestations

PGM1-­CDG is a disorder presenting with midline malformations
(cleft palate, Pierre Robin sequence, bifid uvula), liver dysfunction,
hypoglycemia, and short stature in almost all patients. Hypoglycemia is
usually caused by hyperinsulinism in the first years of life. It can resolve
with aging; ketotic hypoglycemia has also been observed. Cholestasis,
liver fibrosis, and even cirrhosis have been described in a few patients.
About one third of patients also show proximal muscle weakness and
dilated cardiomyopathy; the latter led to mortality in at least seven
reported cases. Other malformations, including cardiac and skeletal
anomalies, have also been described. Wound healing is frequently
abnormal, and there is a very high risk for bleeding during surgery.
Intelligence is normal.

Pathophysiology

Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) is an essential enzyme for glycogenolysis and glycolysis. It also provides substrates for the nucleotide sugars
needed for normal glycosylation. PGM1 regulates the bidirectional
conversion of glucose-­1-­phosphate and glucose-­6-­phosphate. During
fasting it leads to a glycogenosis-­like phenotype (also called GSD XIV,
MIM 614921). PGM1-­CDG affects both the ER-­and Golgi-­related
glycosylation and causes a mixed type 1/type 2 hypoglycosylation pattern. Abnormal serum proteins include coagulation and anticoagulation factors, insulin-­like growth factor–binding protein 3 (IGFBP3),
TBG, and TSH, in addition to serum transaminases, hypoglycemia,
and elevated CK.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a suspected PGM1-­CDG patient is
serum transferrin glycoform analysis or mass spectroscopy analysis.
Patients show a mixed type 1/type 2 pattern.
PGM1-­CDG is autosomal recessive. It is among the relatively common CDGs; >40 patients have been described. Enzyme testing is possible in blood but is more reliable in fibroblasts. Direct sequencing is
available for testing.

Treatment

PGM1-­
CDG is a treatable CDG (see Table 107.1). d-­Galactose
replenishes depleted levels of different nucleotide-­sugars (galactose-­
1-­phosphate, UDP-­galactose, and UDP-­glucose). Adding 1 g/kg/day
d-­galactose (500–2500 mg/kg/day, maximum 50 g/day, divided in up
to six doses/day) to the diet improves glycosylation significantly after
a few weeks, although the transferrin glycoform pattern does not fully
normalize. This treatment improves liver transaminases and antithrombin levels and in some patients the hormonal status. The effect of
d-­galactose on hypoglycemic episodes, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy is not yet clear.

Disorders of Golgi Homeostasis: TMEM199-­CDG,
CCDC115-­CDG, ATP6AP2-­CDG, and ATP6AP1-­CDG
Clinical Manifestations

These four disorders are clinically and biochemically indistinguishable. They have been described with liver function anomalies, cholestasis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis with liver failure, necessitating liver
transplantation in a few patients. The phenotype resembles Wilson
disease, especially because of low serum ceruloplasmin and copper
levels, but there is no Kayser-­Fleischer ring. In CCDC115-­CDG there

and elevated alkaline phosphatase. In ATP6AP1-­CDG there is also
immunologic involvement.

Pathophysiology

TMEM199-­, CCDC115-­, ATP6AP1-­CDG, and ATP6AP2-­CDG
are important for Golgi homeostasis. The exact pathologic mechanism is not yet known, but it is hypothesized that the secondary
Golgi dysfunction affects and delays the normal glycosylation
process.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a patient with one of these suspected
CDGs is serum transferrin glycoform analysis by mass spectroscopy or
TIEF analysis. Patients show a type 2 pattern (see Fig. 107.9). ApoC-­
III TIEF is abnormal. Glycomics results by MALDI-­TOF analysis are
characteristic but cannot discriminate between the three defects. The
final diagnosis requires pathogenic variant analysis. TMEM199-­CDG
and CCDC115-­
CDG are autosomal recessive, whereas ATP6AP1-­
CDG and ATP6AP2-­CDG are X-­linked.

Treatment

Treatment is supportive. Two patients successfully underwent liver
transplantation.

Manganese Transporter Defect: SLC39A8-­CDG
Clinical Manifestations

This intriguing disorder was originally described as a neurologic disease with hypotonia, seizures (hypsarrhythmia), and developmental disability. Some of the later-­described patients had severe skeletal
dysplasia with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia, craniosynostosis, and
dwarfism. Mitochondrial dysfunction (Leigh disease, cerebral lactic
acidemia, dystonia) may also be present.

Pathophysiology

SLC39A8 is a membrane transporter, responsible for manganese
(Mn) transmembrane transport. SLC39A8 deficiency affects all Mn-­
dependent enzymes and therefore different parts of the metabolism.
Because several glycosyltransferases (e.g., β-­1,4-­galactosyltransferase)
are Mn dependent, a secondary Golgi glycosylation occurs with a type
2 glycosylation defect. Low serum Mn levels are suggestive but not
always present in patients.

Diagnosis

The primary screening method in a suspected patient with SLC39A8-­
CDG is serum transferrin glycoform analysis by mass spectroscopy
or TIEF analysis. Patients show a type 2 pattern (see Fig. 107.9).
MALDI-­
TOF analysis is suggestive but not discriminative. Low
serum Mn levels are not always present in patients. The final diagnosis requires pathogenic variant analysis. SLC39A8-­CDG is an autosomal recessive disease. The exact incidence for this rare disease is
unknown.

Treatment

Besides supportive treatment, a few patients have shown biochemical
and clinical improvement (better seizure control) with oral d-­galactose
(1-­3.75 g/kg/day) and manganese (II)-­sulfate monohydrate (15-­20 mg/
kg/day) therapy (see Table 107.7).

CONGENITAL DISORDERS OF DEGLYCOSYLATION
N-­Glycanase 1 Deficiency (NGLY1 Defect)
Clinical Manifestations

Patients with NGLY1 deficiency have a glycosylation disorder, but not
from the deficient synthesis; rather, it is caused by deficient breakdown of
glycoproteins. The phenotype comprises severe CNS involvement, microcephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, neuropathy, movement disorders,
and hypotonia. The presence of alacrimia or hypolacrimia is highly suggestive for the diagnosis, but not all patients have problems with tearing.
Other features include failure to thrive, IUGR, and liver involvement.
Some patients have a recognizable oval face with a short nose, flat profile,
and hypertelorism. Masklike face also occurs, imitating the phenotype of
mitochondrial disorders, especially when serum lactic acid levels are also
elevated.

Pathophysiology

N-­glycanase is responsible for the deglycosylation of misfolded N-­
linked glycoproteins. The enzyme is essential for cutting off the glycans before the proteins are degraded in the ER. The exact disease
pathomechanism, however, is not yet clear. Serum transaminase and
α-­fetoprotein levels are also frequently increased.

Diagnosis

Serum transferrin isoform analysis shows a normal pattern. In some
patients the excretion of a specific urine biomarker (aspartylglucosamine; Neu5Ac1Hex1GlcNAc1-­Asn) is present and can be used as
screening. The final diagnosis requires genetic analysis.
NGLY1-­CDG is an autosomal recessive disease. The most common
pathogenic variant is c.1201A>T/p.R401X. The exact incidence of the
condition is unknown, but >50 patients have been reported in the few
years since the discovery of the disease.

Treatment

Only supportive treatment is available for the patient with NGLY1
deficiency.

THERAPEUTIC SUMMARY (SEE TABLE 107.7)

Most CDGs are treatable only with supportive therapy. The initially discovered oral mannose treatment in MPI-­CDG (1 g/kg/day) has proved to
be efficient for coagulation problems and protein-­losing enteropathy but
cannot prevent liver fibrosis in all patients. Liver transplantation in MPI-­
CDG has been successful in a few patients. Oral d-­galactose in PGM1-­
CDG (1g/kg/day) can improve serum transaminases and coagulation and
have a positive effect on endocrine function but cannot restore glycosylation fully. Seizure frequency improved in patients with SLC39A8-­CDG
receiving oral d-­galactose treatment (1 g/kg/day) and oral manganese
intake. The congenital myasthenic syndrome in DPAGT1-­CDG, GFPT1-­
CDG, and GMPPB-­CDG has been successfully treated with a high dose
of cholinesterase inhibitors. Several CDGs have been positively controlled
by transplantation, including DOLK-­CDG (DK1-­CDG; heart transplantation), PGM3-­CDG (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation), ATP6AP1-­
CDG, and CCDC155-­CDG (liver transplantation).
Patients with CAD-­CDG show significant clinical improvement on
receiving oral uridine therapy, especially with seizure control. Two children with SLC35C1-­CDG–defective immune function improved on
oral fucose therapy. GNE-­CDG patients showed significant improvement in muscle strength on N-­acetylmannosamine therapy.

Chapter 108

Mitochondrial Disease
Diagnosis
Elizabeth M. McCormick and Marni J. Falk
See also Chapters 107.4, 638.2.
Mitochondrial diseases are multisystemic energy failure states with
extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Their common basis is best
understood through recognition that mitochondria function as biologic “fuel cells” or “batteries,” producing chemical energy in the form
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by aerobic metabolism of nutrient-­
derived reducing equivalents, through the integrated function of the
five-­complex mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) (Fig. 108.1). Mitochondria also play other essential roles that can be variably disrupted
in disease states, such as regulating calcium homeostasis, diverse
aspects of intermediary nutrient metabolism, nucleotide metabolism,

931

and oxidative stress. Primary mitochondrial disease results from deficient RC function, which can be caused by pathogenic variants in genes
that encode RC subunits, assembly factors or cofactors, components of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) metabolism and maintenance, or a host
of other basic metabolic processes ongoing within mitochondria (Table
108.1). Approximately 1,500 proteins exist within the mitochondrial
proteome of different tissues, with variants in more than 350 unique
genes across both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes already
implicated as causal in human mitochondrial disease.
Collectively recognized as the most common group of inherited metabolic diseases, primary (genetic based) mitochondrial disease has a combined minimal prevalence of 1 in 4,300 individuals across all ages. In
addition, secondary mitochondrial dysfunction is broadly implicated in
the pathogenesis of a host of complex diseases, ranging from metabolic
syndrome to ischemia-­reperfusion injury after stroke, to neurodegenerative diseases. Failure of high-­energy-­demand organs in mitochondrial
diseases may clinically present as severe neurodevelopmental, cardiac,
myopathic, renal, hepatic, endocrine, immune, gastrointestinal (GI),
hearing, and vision disabilities, as well as global metabolic instability with
lactic acidosis (Fig. 108.2) (see Tables 107.2 and 107.3). In most mitochondrial disorders, the phenotype may vary depending on the patient’s age,
the specific gene or genetic variant, or tissue affected. Particularly common mitochondrial disease clinical syndromes that present in children

ATP synthase. Together, these five complexes are known as the respiratory chain and are the site where oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) occurs
to generate energy. The transport chain accepts electrons from NADH (complex I) or FADH2 (complex II) that have been produced by glycolysis,
the formation of acetyl–coenzyme A, and the TCA cycle (green arrows). Electrons flow from one complex to another (red arrows) because of the
redox potential of each complex and lose a small amount of energy as they move through the chain. Three of the four complexes act as pumps,
driven by electron flow, moving H+ ions from the matrix to the intermembrane space (blue arrows). This pumping builds a concentration gradient
and creates an electrochemical force that is used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Under normal conditions, this machinery provides almost all
(90%) of the ATP in a cell. However, a small proportion of electrons escape the electron transport chain even under normal conditions and can react
with oxygen and complexes I and III to form superoxide (O2−). ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; Cyt c, cytochrome c; Q,

Fig. 108.2 Mitochondrial disease subject cohort experienced symptoms. Frequency of experienced symptoms as reported by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) self-­reported cohort revealed
muscle weakness, chronic fatigue, exercise intolerance, imbalance, and
gastrointestinal problems to be the top five common symptoms. (Modified from Zolkipli-­Cunningham Z, Xiao R, Stoddart A, et al. Mitochondrial disease patient motivations and barriers to participate in clinical
trials. PLoS ONE. 2018;13[5]:e0197513. Fig. 2.)

include Leigh syndrome (for which there are more than 110 causal genes;
for gene listing visit https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/conditions/
MONDO:0009723.), mtDNA depletion syndrome (MDS, for which
there several dozen causal genes), mtDNA deletion syndromes (Pearson, Kearns Sayre), primary lactic acidosis, and pyruvate dehydrogenase
deficiency. Common clinical features in children present in at least 90%
of patients include fatigue, exercise intolerance, weakness, GI and hepatic
dysfunction, ataxia, and developmental delay. Thus mitochondrial diseases present to and must be considered by clinicians across every medical
specialty.
Reversible infantile respiratory chain deficiency is an unusual mitochondrial disorder that presents in early (≤3 months) infancy with muscle
weakness, hypotonia, poor feeding, and lactic acidosis and spontaneously
resolves beginning around 1 year of age. Responsible maternal inherited
genes include mt-­tRNAGlu (MT-­TE) (in 100%) and possible modifier
genes (EARS2, TRMU). Muscle biopsy may show ragged red fibers.
Patients with suspected mitochondrial disease often have an extensive
phenotypic heterogeneity without a common biomarker, which presents
a challenge to the accurate clinical diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders.
Lactate and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-­15) are screening tests
that may be elevated in some mitochondrial diseases, particularly those
involving mtDNA deletions or depletion. In addition, their extensive
genetic heterogeneity involving known etiologies in >300 nuclear genes
and all 37 mtDNA genes can make the accurate genetic diagnosis of an
individual patient challenging. The diagnostic uncertainty can be further
compounded by poor genotype-­phenotype correlations and variable clinical presentations of individual gene disorders, high locus heterogeneity
(i.e., multiple different causal disease genes) for similar clinical phenotypes, incomplete penetrance for some gene disorders, variable life stressors or environmental exposures that may exacerbate a given child’s disease,
and the unique biologic aspects of maternal inheritance for the subset of
mitochondrial diseases caused by mtDNA pathogenic variants.

WHEN TO SUSPECT MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE

Because of failure in the ability to generate cellular energy, mitochondrial diseases can involve any organ system at any age (see Fig. 108.2).
Mitochondrial disease should be suspected when classic symptoms are

933

present or if unexplained symptoms occur in three or more apparently
unrelated organs. Individuals may present with a vast array of symptoms, including fatigue, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, metabolic strokes, seizures, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, developmental or
cognitive disabilities, autism, diabetes mellitus, and other endocrinopathies (adrenal, thyroid), dysautonomia, and autoimmune disorders,
as well as impairment of hearing, vision, growth, liver, GI, or kidney
function. Although individuals may have just one or a few symptoms
and a fluctuating disease course in terms of symptom severity, most
patients with primary mitochondrial disease tend to develop progressive symptoms over time. A study of patients with mitochondrial diseases showed an average of 16 different clinically significant symptoms
per patient, with a range of 7-­35. When considering the diagnosis, it
is helpful to recognize that most symptoms of mitochondrial disease
involve functional, rather than structural, problems.
When mitochondrial disease is considered in the differential diagnosis,
it is often helpful to obtain several laboratory screening studies for common biochemical features of mitochondrial disease and overlapping disorders at baseline and, if unrevealing, during an acute illness or period of
decompensation. Blood-­based metabolic screening studies include comprehensive chemistry panel, complete blood count with differential, blood
lactate and pyruvate, plasma amino acid quantitative analysis, carnitine
analysis (total, free, acyl-­carnitine profile), ammonia, creatine kinase, and
testing for common secondary manifestations of mitochondrial disease
(e.g., thyroid screen, lipoprotein profile, hemoglobin A1c). Urine-­based
metabolic screening studies include urinalysis, urine organic acid quantitative analysis, and urine amino acid quantitative analysis. Consideration
should also be given for screening for congenital disorders of glycosylation
or vitamin deficiencies, which may have overlapping clinical features in
some cases with mitochondrial disease. Lactic acidemia is neither highly
sensitive nor specific for primary mitochondrial disease, but laboratory
findings suggestive of primary mitochondrial disease include elevations
of blood lactate, pyruvate, lactate:pyruvate ratio, alanine, ratios of alanine
to lysine (>3) and alanine to the sum of phenylalanine and tyrosine (>4),
and anion gap. Biochemical alterations further suggestive of mitochondrial disease may include secondary impairment of fatty acid oxidation
with elevation of dicarboxylic acids on acyl-­carnitine profile, increased
branched-­chain amino acids and proline on plasma amino acid analysis, increased tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and lactate excretion
on urine organic acid analysis, and generalized aminoaciduria on urine
amino acid analysis. GDF-­15 may be a useful screening test for mitochondrial depletion-­based myopathies.
Similarly, when mitochondrial disease is considered in the differential
diagnosis, obtaining additional clinical evaluations to carefully phenotype the patient for prevalent or highly morbid and potentially modifiable
features of mitochondrial disease is important. Because many individuals
with mitochondrial disease develop problems with their vision (reduced
visual acuity not correctable with glasses, photophobia or nyctalopia with
reduced peripheral vision associated with retinal disease or optic atrophy,
ophthalmoplegia, ptosis), hearing (high-­frequency sensorineural hearing
loss), and heart (arrhythmia, conduction block, cardiomyopathy), carefully evaluating for involvement of these high-­energy systems is indicated.
Neurologic evaluation is essential because many mitochondrial disease
patients experience a range of central (metabolic stroke in cortical or deep
gray matter, including basal ganglia, midbrain, and/or brainstem; white
matter changes; seizures; ataxia; movement disorder; migraine; cognitive
changes), peripheral (axonal sensorimotor neuropathy), or autonomic nervous system dysfunction; brain imaging (MRI), spectroscopy (MRS), and,
on occasion, electromyogram or nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV)
studies can be helpful to support the diagnosis. Formal exercise physiology evaluation can also be useful to quantify and advise patients on their
exercise capacity and safety, with some specific features (e.g., reduced Vo2
maximal capacity) suggestive of quantifiable mitochondrial dysfunction.
A sleep study may be useful for individuals with sleep dysfunction because
sleep disorders may mimic mitochondrial disease symptoms, and sleep
problems are common and potentially treatable in mitochondrial disease.
Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and underrecognized in mitochondrial disease patients, usually involving dysmotility of any portion of
the GI tract with reflux, swallowing dysfunction, delayed gastric emptying,

feeding and/or growth problems, pseudoobstruction, malabsorption, and
constipation. Endocrine abnormalities are also common but underappreciated in many patients, including pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, and pancreatic dysfunction.
Such careful phenotyping of patients with suspected mitochondrial
disease can thus provide reassurance that the common, and potentially treatable, clinical aspects of mitochondrial disease are not present
although they may develop over time, or conversely if identified, increase
diagnostic suspicion and direct further diagnostic evaluation. A screening tool for mitochondrial diseases is noted in Table 108.2. The differential diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders is extensive (Table 108.3).

MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE INHERITANCE

Primary mitochondrial disease may result from variants in either nuclear
genes or mtDNA genes, which may be inherited from a parent or occur
de novo in an affected individual (for a list of genes curated for their association with primary mitochondrial disease, visit https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/affiliate/10027). Thus all mendelian (autosomal recessive,
autosomal dominant, X-­linked) or maternal (mtDNA) inheritance patterns can be consistent with mitochondrial diseases. Obtaining a detailed,
three-­generation pedigree is important to potentially highlight the specific
inheritance pattern in a family. Individuals with inherited mtDNA disorders may report family members related through their maternal lineage
(both males and females may be affected, but only affected individuals
will be connected through the female germline), with a range of functional problems in different organs, such as migraines, fatigue, exercise
intolerance, stroke, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, irritable bowel
syndrome, mood disorder, or vision and hearing problems (for a list of
curated mtDNA variants, visit https://erepo.clinicalgenome.org). Inherited
X-­linked disorders typically present with symptoms only or, more severely,
in males related through unaffected or minimally affected females. Autosomal recessive disorders are common in pediatric mitochondrial disease,
particularly in consanguineous pedigrees, where a rare variant in the general population becomes enriched and passed down through both maternal and paternal lineages to become homozygous in the affected proband
and also affect multiple individuals in a given generation without having
affected individuals in earlier generations. Autosomal dominant variants may occur de novo or are passed on from either parent to their child,
although many disorders may have reduced penetrance, which may make
the genetic disorder appear to skip a generation. Identifying a likely inheritance pattern through pedigree analysis can inform accurate interpretation
of large-­scale genetic diagnostic evaluations, such as multigene sequencing
and deletion/duplication analysis panels and exome or genome sequencing. Establishing a correct genetic diagnosis for mitochondrial disease in
an affected individual is essential to enable reliable recurrence risk counseling and testing options in a given family, whether in a future pregnancy by
chorionic villus sampling (CVS, typically performed at 10-­12 weeks’ gestation) or amniocentesis (typically performed at 16-­20 weeks’ gestation)
or in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) setting with preimplantation genetic
testing (PGT) for a specific disease-­causing variant. Of note, PGT is readily available to families for known nuclear gene disorders but remains of
limited availability in known pathogenic mtDNA variants.
Special mention is warranted to consider the unique aspects of maternal inheritance that typify mtDNA disorders. More than 300 disease-­
causing mtDNA variants have been identified, with extensive variation
in disease manifestations and features. Most disease-­causing variants
are present in only a portion of an individual’s mtDNA genomes, a
concept known as heteroplasmy. For heteroplasmic mtDNA variants,
the precise pathogenic variant level (percent) can vary between an
individual’s different tissues and can change over time, with symptom
severity corresponding to different threshold pathogenic variant levels
that can be difficult to define and that typically vary between organs.
An individual’s mtDNA genome background set of fixed sequence
variants, known as a haplogroup, can also influence the penetrance
or severity of an mtDNA disease. When a novel or rare mtDNA variant is identified in a given individual, it may be helpful to use highly
sensitive sequencing methods to test the levels of that pathogenic variant (which may be accurate to detect 1% of pathogenic variant levels)
in their different tissues (blood, urine, buccal, skin cells, muscle), as
well as tissues from their mother or maternal relatives, to accurately

based functional testing may also be necessary to characterize fully the
effects of a newly recognized mtDNA variant. When it is not known
whether an mtDNA variant is maternally inherited or occurs de novo,
the recurrence risk to future offspring of their asymptomatic parent is
empirically estimated at 1 in 25 (4%), although the empirical recurrence risk rises to 1 in 2 (50%) when the mother is symptomatic.

936 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR MITOCHONDRIAL
DISEASE

The diagnosis of mitochondrial disease relies foremost on genetic testing (genomic analysis), with biochemical screens useful in blood or
urine and invasive tissue testing often seen as secondary or sometimes
not required at all (Fig. 108.3).
When the clinical evaluation—medical history; detailed review of systems; careful physical, neurologic, and dysmorphic examinations; pedigree
review; blood-­and urine-­based biochemical screening studies; and additional phenotyping clinical evaluations—is suggestive of mitochondrial
disease, a range of clinical diagnostic testing options can be pursued. Without a known molecular etiology in an affected family member, first-­line
genetic diagnostic testing should include whole exome sequencing (WES)
and mtDNA genome sequencing using methodologies that will detect
both single-­nucleotide variants and larger-­scale gene deletions and duplications. WES is more comprehensive for genes known not only to cause
mitochondrial disease but also to cause all human genetic diseases. The
rationale for this diagnostic testing approach includes the following factors:
• The mtDNA genome sequence is often included at no extra cost
when clinical WES is ordered in blood or buccal samples but may
need to be repeated in a symptomatic tissue (e.g., muscle, liver) to
detect heteroplasmic mtDNA variants that may not be present in
more accessible tissues such as blood or buccal cells.
• The utility of performing concurrent proband and both parental
sample sequencing (trio-­based testing), as usually pursued with WES
but not panel-­based testing, thereby allowing concurrent segregation analysis of a suspected pathogenic variants as well as ready identification of de novo dominant variants in the proband.
• The ability to use WES raw data (either on a research basis or for
reanalysis at a later date by the clinical diagnostic laboratory) to
highlight and/or identify “novel” gene disorders not previously recognized or associated with human disease.
Exome sequencing including mtDNA is estimated to identify the definitive genetic etiology for mitochondrial disease in at least 60% of patients

in whom it is strongly suspected. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
is increasingly used when routine molecular testing such as WES with
mtDNA sequencing is unrevealing of the genetic etiology. A mitochondrial disease community resource to centrally curate all mitochondrial
disease, gene, and variant knowledge across both genomes is publicly
accessible at https://mseqdr.org/.
Tissue-­based diagnostic testing has decreased in frequency as a front-­
line test in all patients with suspected mitochondrial disease, although it
still has clinical utility. These include (1) in the setting of rapidly deteriorating clinical status when genetic testing results may not be available in
a timely fashion; (2) when a variant of uncertain significance identified
on genomic testing has unclear biochemical consequences; and (3) when
uninformative genomic sequencing in blood in an individual with myopathy or muscle symptoms raises concern for other disease processes that may
be evident on histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, or
enzymatic tissue testing. In addition, some mitochondrial diseases are only
evident by tissue-­based diagnostic testing. These include mtDNA deletion
disorders (typically involving several thousand nucleotides) not present in
blood that cause chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)
or Kearns-­Sayre syndrome (KSS) spectrum disorder, as well as different
tissue (muscle or liver)-­specific mtDNA depletion disorders (e.g., reduced
mtDNA tissue content) that confirm a mitochondrial pathophysiology in
a given patient and highlight a likely underlying nuclear gene cause for
their disease, because mtDNA maintenance requires a host of nuclear-­
encoded proteins. Electron transport chain enzyme activity analyses
are the accepted gold standard to evaluate for mitochondrial dysfunction
in a previously frozen tissue sample. Skin biopsies are useful to establish
fibroblast cell lines in which these same studies of mitochondrial function
can be clinically performed. If detected, abnormalities can be revealing of
a specific type of mitochondrial disorder, although not all mitochondrial
diseases may be expressed or detectable in skin analysis. Thus if fibroblast
testing is unrevealing, more invasive tissue studies may subsequently need
to be pursued. RNA sequencing may lead to identification of the genetic
etiology in an additional 10% of individuals with mitochondrial disease in

whom DNA-­based sequencing did not identify the disease-­causing variants. Only a small number of clinical laboratories offer this testing; this
test can be performed in muscle, fibroblasts, or blood. Fibroblast cell lines,
and occasionally blood-­based lymphoblastoid cell lines, also provide a
minimally invasive cell source to allow other clinical enzymatic analyses to
be performed, as well as novel disease gene validation and research-­based
therapeutic modeling.

Although few mitochondrial diseases have efficacious therapies that
have gained regulatory approval, improved molecular delineation has
enabled selected therapies to advance from the theoretical, empirical,
and largely ineffective stage to a promising horizon of rational, personalized, and effective interventions. An increasing number of mitochondrial disease diagnoses have interventions involving the initiation or
avoidance of specific medications (corticosteroids, valproic acid, phenytoin, barbiturates, propofol for prolonged duration beyond 30-­60
minutes, certain anesthetics, statins, β-­blocking agents, amiodarone,
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), provision of cofactors or
diets, and screening regimens for progressive clinical involvement of
modifiable manifestations. General therapies for Leigh syndrome such
as l-­arginine and citrulline may prevent or reverse neurodevelopmental sequelae from a metabolic stroke. Nutritional therapies in these disorders are tailored to specific disease genes, such as thiamine and biotin
for SLC19A3 disease, ubiquinol for PDSS2 (CoQ10 deficiency) disease,
and thiamine and the ketogenic diet for PDHA1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) deficiency. Establishing the precise molecular diagnosis can
further be lifesaving by avoiding fasting and mitochondrial-­toxic medicines or general anesthetics in specific mitochondrial disease subsets,
improving recurrence counseling for risk reduction of manifesting
mitochondrial disease, enabling targeted screening for reported medical complications, and in some cases providing necessary cofactors or
vitamins that may not otherwise have been considered. In addition,
reproductive methodologies emerging in some countries for mitochondrial disease prevention, such as PGD and mitochondrial replacement technologies (MRTs), are only appropriate to consider in the
setting of known pathogenic, inherited mtDNA variants.

TREATMENT PRINCIPLES FOR MITOCHONDRIAL
DISEASE

Effective therapies for both primary and secondary mitochondrial
diseases are lacking. Clinical complexity and imprecisely defined or
understood biochemical phenotypes of different mitochondrial disease subtypes have made it difficult for clinicians to effectively apply
or monitor targeted therapies for RC disease. Mitochondrial cocktails
consisting of combinatorial regimens of vitamins and supplements
variably include vitamins (B1, B2, C), antioxidants (CoQ10, lipoic acid,
vitamin E, N-­acetylcysteine), and metabolic modifiers (creatine, l-­
carnitine, l-­arginine, folinic acid, taurine). Although the efficacy, toxicity, and optimal dose of these drugs are not known and have not been
objectively assessed via clinical trials in human RC disease patients,
they continue to be empirically prescribed in hopes of enhancing residual RC enzymatic function or quenching toxic metabolites theorized to
accumulate in RC dysfunction and because of patient-­based reports of
improved well-­being. However, provision of these therapies has often
adopted a one-­size-­fits-­all approach, ignoring the inherent variation
in primary mitochondrial disease subtypes, the tissue-­specific manifestations, and the major pathogenic factors, such as the predominant
downstream metabolic and signaling alterations that occur in different
disease subclasses (Fig. 108.4).

Chapter 109

Mucopolysaccharidoses
Christina Lampe
Mucopolysaccharidoses are hereditary progressive diseases caused by
pathogenic variants of genes coding for the lysosomal enzymes needed
to degrade glycosaminoglycans (acid mucopolysaccharides). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long-­chain complex carbohydrates composed of
uronic acids, amino sugars, and neutral sugars. The major GAGs are
chondroitin-­4-­sulfate, chondroitin-­6-­sulfate, heparan sulfate, dermatan
sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronan. These substances are synthesized
and, with the exception of hyaluronan, linked to proteins to form proteoglycans, major constituents of the ground substance of connective tissue
and of nuclear and cell membranes. Degradation of proteoglycans starts
with the proteolytic removal of the protein core, followed by the stepwise
degradation of the GAG moiety. Failure of this degradation because of
absent or grossly reduced activity of mutated lysosomal enzymes results
in the intralysosomal accumulation of GAG fragments (Fig. 109.1). Distended lysosomes accumulate in the cell, interfere with cell function, and
lead to characteristic patterns of clinical, radiologic, and biochemical
abnormalities (Table 109.1 and Fig. 109.2). Within these patterns, specific diseases can be recognized that evolve from the intracellular accumulation of different degradation products (Table 109.2). As a general
rule, the impaired degradation of heparan sulfate is more closely associated with intellectual disability and that of dermatan, chondroitin, and
keratan sulfate with mesenchymal abnormalities. Variable expression
within a given entity results from allelic pathogenic variants and varying residual activity of mutated enzymes. For instance, different allelic
variants of the gene encoding l-­iduronidase may result in severe Hurler
disease (Hurler syndrome) with early death or in mild Scheie disease
(Scheie syndrome) manifesting only with limited joint mobility, mild
skeletal abnormalities, and corneal opacities. In addition, the features of
an individual patient will be modified by secondary effects of lysosomal
dysfunction and environmental factors.
Mucopolysaccharidoses are autosomal recessive disorders, with the
exception of Hunter disease (Hunter syndrome), which is X-­linked
recessive. Their birth prevalence varies between 1.2 per 100,000 births
(United States) and 16.9 per 100,000 births (Saudi Arabia). In the
United States the most common subtype is MPS-­III, followed by MPS-­I
and MPS-­II.

CLINICAL ENTITIES
Mucopolysaccharidosis I

Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS-­I) is caused by pathogenic variants of
the IUA gene on chromosome 4p16.3 encoding α-­l-­iduronidase. Two
major alleles, W402X and Q70X, account for more than half of the
MPS-­I alleles in the White population. Other pathogenic variants typically occur in only one or a few individuals.
Deficiency of α-­l-­iduronidase results in a wide range of clinical
involvement. Homozygous nonsense pathogenic variants result in the
absence of enzyme and severe forms of MPS-­I (Hurler syndrome).
In contrast, missense pathogenic variants are more likely to preserve
some residual enzyme activity and be associated with a milder form of
the disease, including the milder Scheie syndrome.

Hurler Disease

The Hurler form of MPS-­I (MPS I-­H) is a severe, progressive disorder with involvement of multiple organ and tissue involvement that
results in premature death, usually by 10 years of age. An infant with
Hurler syndrome appears normal at birth, but inguinal hernias may
be present. Diagnosis is usually made at 6-­24 months, with evidence
of hepatosplenomegaly, coarse facial features, corneal clouding, large
tongue, enlarged head circumference, joint stiffness, short stature,
and skeletal dysplasia. Acute cardiomyopathy has been found in some

infants <1 year. Most patients have recurrent upper respiratory tract
and ear infections, noisy breathing, and persistent copious nasal discharge. Valvular heart disease, notably with incompetence of the mitral
and aortic valves, regularly develops, and narrowing of the coronary
arteries occurs. Obstructive airway disease, especially during sleep,
may necessitate tracheotomy. Obstructive airway disease, respiratory
infection, and cardiac complications are the common causes of death.
Most children with Hurler syndrome acquire only limited language
skills because of developmental delay, combined conductive and neurosensory hearing loss, and an enlarged tongue. Progressive ventricular
enlargement with increased intracranial pressure caused by communicating hydrocephalus also occurs. Corneal clouding, glaucoma, and
retinal degeneration are common. Radiographs show a characteristic
skeletal dysplasia known as dysostosis multiplex (Figs. 109.3 and 109.4).
The earliest radiographic signs are thick ribs and ovoid vertebral bodies. Skeletal abnormalities (in addition to those shown in the figures)
include enlarged, coarsely trabeculated diaphyses of the long bones
with irregular metaphyses and epiphyses. With progression of disease,
macrocephaly develops with thickened calvarium, premature closure

The clinical phenotype of the Hurler-­Scheie form of MPS-­I (MPS
I-­H/S) is intermediate between Hurler and Scheie diseases and is
characterized by progressive somatic involvement, including dysostosis multiplex with little or no intellectual dysfunction. The onset of
symptoms is usually observed between 3 and 8 years of age, and survival to adulthood is common. Cardiac involvement and upper airway
obstruction contribute to clinical morbidity. Some patients have spondylolisthesis, which may cause cord compression.

multiplex. Onset of significant symptoms is usually after age 5 years,
with diagnosis made between 10 and 20 years. Patients with Scheie
syndrome have normal intelligence and stature but have significant joint and ocular involvement. A carpal tunnel syndrome often
develops. Ophthalmic features include corneal clouding, glaucoma,
and retinal degeneration. Obstructive airway disease, causing sleep
apnea, develops in some patients, necessitating tracheotomy. Aortic
valve disease is common and has required valve replacement in some
patients.

Mucopolysaccharidosis II

Hunter disease (MPS-­II) is an X-­linked disorder caused by the deficiency of iduronate 2-­sulfatase (IDS). The gene encoding IDS is located
on Xq28. Single-­nucleotide variants or small deletions of IDS have
been detected in approximately 50% of patients with MPS-­II. Major
deletions or rearrangements of IDS have been found in the rest, usually
associated with a more severe and complex clinical phenotype. As an
X-­linked recessive disorder, Hunter syndrome manifests almost exclusively in males. However, it has been observed in females because of
unfavorable skewing of inactivation of the normal X chromosome carrying the normal gene.
Marked molecular heterogeneity explains the wide clinical spectrum of Hunter disease. Patients with severe MPS-­II have features
similar to those of Hurler disease, except for the lack of corneal
clouding and the somewhat slower progression of somatic and central nervous system (CNS) deterioration. Coarse facial features, short
stature, dysostosis multiplex, joint stiffness, and intellectual disability manifest between 2 and 4 years of age. Grouped skin papules are
present in some patients. Extensive congenital dermal melanocytosis
(Mongolian spots) present at birth have been observed in African and
Asian patients and may be an early marker of the disease. Gastrointestinal (GI) storage may produce chronic diarrhea. Communicating
hydrocephalus and spastic paraplegia may develop due to thickened
meninges. In severely affected patients, extensive, slowly progressive
neurologic involvement precedes death, which usually occurs at age
10-­15 years.
Patients with the mild form have a near-­normal or normal life span,
minimal CNS involvement, and slow progression of somatic deterioration with preservation of cognitive function in adult life. Survival to
ages 65 and 87 years has been reported, and some patients have had
children. Somatic features are Hurler-­like but milder with a greatly

reduced rate of progression. Adult height may exceed 150 cm. Airway
involvement, valvular cardiac disease, hearing impairment, carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint stiffness are common and can result in significant loss of function in both the mild and severe forms.

Mucopolysaccharidosis III

Sanfilippo disease makes up a genetically heterogeneous but clinically
similar group of four recognized types. Each type is caused by a different enzyme deficiency involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate

(see Fig. 109.1). Pathogenic variants have been found in all the MPS-­III
disorders for which genes have been isolated.
Phenotypic variation exists in MPS-­III patients, but to a lesser
degree than in other MPS disorders. Patients with Sanfilippo disease
are characterized by slowly progressive, severe CNS involvement with
mild somatic disease. Such disproportionate involvement of the CNS
versus the connective tissue system is unique to MPS-­III. Onset of clinical features usually occurs at age 2-­6 years in a child who previously
appeared normal. Presenting features include delayed development,

hyperactivity with aggressive behavior, coarse hair, hirsutism, sleep
disorders, and mild hepatosplenomegaly. Subclinical cardiac defects
are common. Delays in the diagnosis of MPS-­III are common because
of mild physical features, hyperactivity, and slowly progressive neurologic disease. Severe neurologic deterioration occurs in most patients
by age 6-­10 years, accompanied by rapid deterioration of social and
adaptive skills. Severe behavior problems, such as sleep disturbance,
uncontrolled hyperactivity, temper tantrums, destructive behavior, and
physical aggression, are common. Profound developmental regression
and behavior problems often occur in patients with normal physical
strength, making management particularly difficult.

Mucopolysaccharidosis IV

Morquio disease (MPS-­
IV) is caused by a deficiency of N-­
acetylgalactosamine-­6-­sulfatase (MPS-­IVA) or of β-­galactosidase
(MPS-­IVB). Both result in the defective degradation of keratan sulfate.
The gene encoding N-­acetylgalactosamine-­6-­sulfatase is GALNS on
chromosome 16q24.3, and the gene encoding β-­galactosidase is GLB1
on chromosome 3p21.33. β-­Galactosidase catalyzes GM1 ganglioside
in addition to endohydrolysis of keratan sulfate, and most pathogenic
variants of GLB1 result in generalized gangliosidosis, a spectrum of
neurodegenerative disorders associated with dysostosis multiplex. A

state or as part of compound heterozygosity, commonly results in
Morquio B disease.
Both types of Morquio syndrome are characterized by short-­trunk
dwarfism, fine corneal deposits, a skeletal dysplasia that is distinct from
other mucopolysaccharidoses, and preservation of intelligence. MPS-­
IVA is usually more severe than MPS-­IVB, with an adult height of <125
cm in the former and more than 150 cm in the latter. However, there is
considerable variability of expression in both subtypes. The appearance
of genu valgum, kyphosis, growth retardation with short trunk and neck,
and waddling gait with a tendency to fall are early symptoms of MPS-­IV.
Extraskeletal manifestations include mild corneal clouding, small teeth
with abnormally thin enamel, frequent caries formation, and occasionally hepatomegaly and cardiac valvular lesions. Instability of the odontoid process and ligamentous laxity is regularly present and can result in
atlantoaxial instability and life-­threatening dislocation. Surgery to stabilize the upper cervical spine, usually by posterior spinal fusion, before
the development of cervical myelopathy, can be lifesaving.

Mucopolysaccharidosis VI

Maroteaux-­
Lamy disease (MPS-­
VI) is caused by pathogenic variants of the ARSB gene on chromosome 5q11-­
13 encoding N-­
acetylgalactosamine-­4-­sulfatase (arylsulfatase B). It is characterized by
severe to mild somatic involvement, as seen in MPS-­I, but with preservation of intelligence. The somatic involvement of the severe form
of MPS VI is characterized by corneal clouding, coarse facial features,
joint stiffness, valvular heart disease, communicating hydrocephalus,
and dysostosis multiplex. In the severe form, growth can be normal
for the first few years of life but seems to virtually stop after age 6-­8
years. The mild to intermediate forms of Maroteaux-­Lamy syndrome
can be easily confused with Scheie syndrome. Spinal cord compression
from thickening of the dura in the upper cervical canal with resultant
myelopathy is common in patients with MPS-­VI.

Mucopolysaccharidosis VII

Sly disease (MPS-­VII) is caused by pathogenic variants of the GUSB
gene. Pathogenic variants result in a deficiency of β-­glucuronidase,
intracellular storage of glycosaminoglycan fragments, and a very
wide range of clinical involvement. The most severe form presents
as lethal nonimmune fetal hydrops and may be detected in utero by
ultrasound. Some severely affected newborns survive for months and
have, or develop, signs of lysosomal storage, including thick skin, visceromegaly, and dysostosis multiplex. Less severe forms of MPS-­VII
present during the first years of life with features of MPS-­I but slower
progression. Corneal clouding varies. Patients with manifestation after
4 years of life have coarse facial features with depressed nasal roots,
malpositioned teeth with malformed roots, and skeletal abnormalities
of dysostosis multiplex. Intelligence is normal, and corneae are usually
clear. Patients may be found incidentally based on a blood smear that
shows coarse granulocytic inclusions.

Mucopolysaccharidosis IX

MPS-­IX disease is caused by pathogenic variants in HYAL1 encoding one of three hyaluronidases. Clinical findings in the first patient, a
14-­year-­old girl, were bilateral nodular soft tissue periarticular masses,
lysosomal storage of histiocytes, mildly dysmorphic craniofacial features, short stature, normal joint movement, and normal intelligence.
Clinical findings in the only three additional patients known today
were indistinguishable from those in rheumatoid arthritis.

Mucopolysaccharidosis Plus Syndrome

Coarse facial features, organomegaly, joint contractures, dysostosis
multiplex, cognitive deficiency, increased mucopolysacchariduria,
and massive intracellular accumulation of heparan sulfate have been
found in 13 children in northeastern Siberia and two Turkish children.
Additional findings include optic atrophy, intracerebral calcifications,
pancytopenia, and renal insufficiency. Most patients died within the
first 2 years of life from cardiorespiratory failure. Lysosomal enzyme
activities were normal in children with MPS plus syndrome. This autosomal recessive multisystem disorder is caused by biallelic pathogenic

variants of VPS33A encoding a protein involved in lysosomal fusion
processes.

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Clinical suspicion of an MPS justifies a skeletal survey. Radiographs of
the chest, spine, pelvis, and hands may show early signs of dysostosis
multiplex. The next diagnostic step is to assay the urinary excretion of
GAGs. Semiquantitative spot tests for increased urinary GAG excretion are quick, inexpensive, and useful for initial evaluation but are
subject to both false-­positive and false-­negative results. Quantitative
analysis of a single GAG in material derived from dried blood spots
is preferable with few false-­negative results. Using tandem mass spectrometry, type-­specific profiles can be obtained. Morquio disease is
often missed in urinary assays but can be reliably diagnosed in serum
using monoclonal antibodies to keratan sulfate.
Newborn screening for MPS (type I, II, VI) is essential for the early
detection of subclinical cases and their therapy. It is available from
dried blood spots using tandem mass spectrometry of glycosaminoglycans or fluorescence-­based enzyme function assays. Any individual with a suspected MPS disorder based on screening tests, clinical
features, and radiographic results should have a definitive diagnosis
established by enzyme assay. Serum, leukocytes, or cultured fibroblasts are used as the tissue source for measuring lysosomal enzymes
(see Table 109.2).
Prenatal diagnosis is available for all MPSs and is carried out on cultured cells from amniotic fluid or chorionic villus biopsy. Molecular
analysis is typically performed using appropriate gene panels. In many
cases the type and location of the pathogenic variant are related to the
future course of the disease and thus have a prognostic value. Carrier
testing in Hunter syndrome, an X-­linked disorder, requires analysis of
IDS once the specific pathogenic variant or chromosome arrangement
in the family is known. Prenatal molecular analysis should be offered
in a male fetus of a proven female carrier of the IDS gene. His risk to
be affected is 50%. In a female fetus, the risk is small, but not zero, as a
result of skewed maternal X chromosome inactivation.
Mucolipidoses and oligosaccharidoses manifest with the same clinical and radiographic features as MPS. In these conditions the urinary
excretion of GAGs is not elevated. Hurler-­like facial features, joint contractures, dysostosis multiplex, and elevated urinary GAG excretion
differentiate the MPSs from congenital disorders of glycosylation and
other neurodegenerative and dwarfing conditions.

TREATMENT

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and enzyme replacement
therapy are performed in specialized institutions.
Bone marrow transplantation from related or unrelated donors
and cord blood transplantation have resulted in significant clinical improvement of somatic disease in MPSs I, II, III, and VII.
Clinical effects include increased life expectancy with resolution or
improvement of growth, hepatosplenomegaly, joint stiffness, facial
appearance, skin changes, obstructive sleep apnea, heart disease,
communicating hydrocephalus, and hearing loss. Enzyme activity in serum and urinary GAG excretion normalize. This is true for
MPS I-­H, II, and III. Some patients with MPS-­I who have undergone
transplantation before 9 months of age have been reported with normal cognitive development. Transplantation before 24 months and
with a baseline mental development index >70 have improved long-­
term outcomes. Transplantation does not significantly improve the
neuropsychologic outcome of MPS patients with impaired cognition
at transplantation. Early transplantation in the MPS-­II patient may
have the same effect. Transplantation in the MPS-­VI patient stabilizes or improves cardiac manifestations, posture, and joint mobility.
Stem cell transplantation does not correct skeletal or ocular anomalies, and they should be treated with appropriate orthopedic and ophthalmologic procedures. Cord blood transplantation is the therapy
of choice in children with MPS-­IH, and possibly MPS-­II, before the
age of 2 years, but transplantation-­related death or primary graft failure, which occurs in approximately one third of the patients, must be
weighed against other therapeutic options.

Chapter 109 u Mucopolysaccharidoses
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant α-­l-­
iduronidase has been approved for patients with MPS-­I (Table 109.3).
It reduces organomegaly and airway infections, improves rate of
growth, improves joint mobility, pulmonary function, and endurance,
and reduces the number of episodes of sleep apnea and urinary GAG
excretion. The enzyme does not cross the blood-­brain barrier and does
not prevent deterioration of cognition and other neurologic functions.
Consequently, ERT is reserved for patients with mild CNS involvement. To stabilize extraneural manifestations it is also recommended in
young patients before stem cell transplantation. ERT also ameliorates
somatic complications in patients with more severe CNS involvement.
Recombinant iduronate-­2-­sulfatase ameliorates the nonneural manifestations of Hunter disease, such as respiratory dysfunction, reduced
physical endurance, and daily activity. ERT with recombinant human
GALNS improves physical endurance, respiratory function, and daily
living activity of patients with MPS-­IV. Similar effects produce recombinant N-­acetylgalactosamine-­4-­sulfatase in patients with MPS-­VI and
recombinant β-­glucuronidase in MPS VII.

943

Advanced therapies include enzyme replacement mediated via insulin
receptors in MPS I and II or transferrin receptors in MPS II to assist
in crossing the blood-­brain barrier. A phase I/II and a phase III study
using the transferrin receptor have started for MPS II. In MPS IIIA, an
intravenous ERT phase 1/2 study with a chemically modified variant of
recombinant human sulfamidase and a recombinant human alpha-­N-­
acetylglucosaminidase for MPS IIIB were recently completed. However,
the study results were not convincing. A phase I/II study for MPS III
using the transferrin receptor is in planning. Gene therapies for MPS I,
II, and III are under investigation. Autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced ex vivo with an α-­l-­iduronidase–encoded lentiviral vector has resulted in beneficial metabolic correction in peripheral
and central nervous system tissues. A clinical trial to ameliorate the
intracellular inflammation and, consequently, the CNS involvement in
MPS III with anakinra (Kineret) was completed with results pending.
Symptomatic therapy focuses on respiratory and cardiovascular complications, hearing loss, carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal cord
compression, hydrocephalus, and other problems (Table 109.4). The

Disorders of Purine and
Pyrimidine Metabolism
H. A. Jinnah
The purines and pyrimidines consist of a family of small organic molecules that are found in all cells. They are often considered together
because they provide the fundamental building blocks for nucleic acids,
which include DNA and RNA. The purines and pyrimidines are also
involved in numerous other cellular processes. Although they share
certain biochemical characteristics, the associated clinical disorders
are quite varied. Historically, most were identified by characteristic
abnormalities found with metabolic tests. Currently, they are increasingly being identified after discovery of a pathogenic variant in a relevant gene in tests that involve broad gene panels or exome sequencing.
Most of these disorders are genetic, and most are rare. However, they
are important to recognize because specific treatments are available for
some of them (Table 110.1).

PURINES

The purines are divided into two groups. The first group involves the
base adenine, its corresponding nucleoside (adenosine), and nucleotide (AMP, ADP, ATP) derivatives (Fig. 110.1). ATP serves as one of
four building blocks for RNA, and its deoxy derivative (dATP) serves
as one of four building blocks for DNA. ATP also provides the energy
source for the majority of energy-­requiring activities. ATP derivatives
act as signaling factors as “second messengers” (cAMP) or cofactors
(FAD, NAD, NADP) for a large number of cellular processes. Some
purines such as adenosine and the adenine nucleotides serve as extracellular signaling molecules, including acting as neurotransmitters in
the nervous system.

The second group of purines involves the base guanine, its corresponding nucleoside (guanosine), and nucleotide (GMP, GDP, GTP)
derivatives (see Fig. 110.1). Like the adenine nucleotides, guanine
nucleotide derivatives also serve as building blocks for nucleic acids
(DNA and RNA). GTP also provides an energy source for some
energy-­requiring activities. Guanine nucleotides also play a critical role
in intercellular signaling (cGMP) via membrane-­bound receptors that
require GTP during signal transduction (G-­proteins). They also play
a role in intracellular signaling via a large family of cytosolic GTPases
and guanine nucleotide exchange factors.
Because purines play a critical role for so many fundamental cellular processes, their amounts are tightly regulated. The amounts of
purines reflect a balance between synthesis, catabolism, and recycling
(Fig. 110.2). Purines are synthesized by the de novo purine synthesis
pathway. This pathway has six enzymes that carry out 10 reactions.
When there is a demand for more purines, these six enzymes aggregate
dynamically into giant macromolecular complexes known as purinosomes to accelerate synthesis. After the demand is met, these aggregates
disperse and synthesis abates. In humans, purines are catabolized via
several routes. The major end product of purine catabolism is uric acid,
produced by the enzyme encoded by the XDH gene. The enzyme is
known as xanthine oxidase, xanthine reductase, or xanthine oxidoreductase. Most of this uric acid is eliminated from the body in the urine,
although some is also eliminated by secretion into the gastrointestinal
tract. Because the synthesis of purines is energetically costly, purines
are actively recycled (see Fig. 110.2). The key enzymes of purine salvage
include hypoxanthine-­guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (encoded
by HPRT1) and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (encoded by
APRT).
The metabolism of purines differs considerably across different cells
and tissues. For example, the synthetic pathway is absent in erythrocytes, because these postmitotic cells do not require large quantities
of new purines to make nucleic acids for cell division. Erythrocytes
rely instead predominantly on purine salvage to maintain purine levels. A similar situation is thought to occur for postmitotic neurons of
the nervous system. Another example of tissue-­specific differences in
purine metabolism involves uric acid. The vast majority of uric acid in
the human body is produced by the liver, because hepatocytes express
high levels of XDH, whereas many other cells and tissues express little
or none. In addition to tissue differences, several enzymes of purine
metabolism have multiple isoforms with different tissue distributions,
leading to tissue-­specific consequences in disorders where one isoform
is affected.

PYRIMIDINES

The pyrimidines are divided into three groups delineated by the bases
cytosine, thymine, and uracil (see Fig. 110.1). Each has a corresponding nucleoside derivative (cytidine, thymidine, uridine) and nucleotide

derivatives (see Fig. 110.1). Like the purines, the pyrimidines are key
ingredients for nucleic acids. Nucleotide derivatives of cytidine are used
to make DNA and RNA. Nucleotide derivatives of thymidine are used in
DNA, but nucleotide derivatives of uridine replace thymidine in RNA.
The pyrimidines also have additional functions; CTP is used to make
CDP-­choline, an important intermediate in the production of membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine. UTP is used to make
UDP-­glucose, an intermediate used in the synthesis of glycogen, as well
as other glycosylation reactions, to make glycolipids or glycoproteins.
UTP is also used to make UDP-­glucuronic acid, an intermediate used
in the generation of glucuronide conjugates. Glucuronide conjugates of
certain drugs and drug metabolites are excreted in the bile, and glucuronide conjugates of other endogenous biomolecules such as steroid
hormones facilitate transport between tissues in the body.

The body’s pyrimidine levels reflect a balance between synthesis,
catabolism, and recycling. Pyrimidines are synthesized in a pathway that involves three enzymes which carry out six steps leading to the central metabolite UMP (Fig. 110.3). UMP can then be
directed toward the synthesis of other pyrimidines. Pyrimidines
are catabolized via several routes. Cytidine and uridine derivatives are both converted to uracil, and ultimately to β-­alanine.
Thymidine is converted to β-­aminoisobutyrate. Both β-­alanine
and β-­aminoisobutyrate serve as intermediates in the citric acid
cycle. Free pyrimidines are also recycled at several steps by kinases
that convert nucleosides to their corresponding nucleotides (see
Fig. 110.3). Pyrimidine disorders are rare and clinically heterogeneous. The heterogeneity likely reflects the different functions of

Chapter 110 u Disorders of Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism

DISORDERS OF PURINE METABOLISM
Uric Acid

Serum uric acid levels reflect a balance among production, absorption, and excretion. Most uric acid is produced in the body as a by-­
product of purine metabolism (see Fig. 110.2). Some also comes from
the diet, when DNA and RNA of foods are metabolized by the gut and
liver. About two thirds of the body’s uric acid is eliminated by the kidneys, with the remainder eliminated by the gut. Normal serum uric
acid levels are age dependent. Relatively low levels in young children
reach adult values by puberty. After puberty, serum uric acid is lower
in females than in males.
In adults, numerous epidemiologic studies have linked abnormal
serum uric acid levels with a large number of disorders. High levels
of uric acid have been linked with gout, kidney disease, tophi, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, heart disease,
stroke, hemolytic anemia, Down syndrome, asthma, and others. Causal
links between uric acid and disease with well-­defined biologic mechanisms are well established for gout, kidney disease, and tophi. Low
levels of uric acid have been linked with Parkinson disease, Alzheimer
disease, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune disorders. For these
disorders, uric acid has been proposed to have antioxidant properties,
so chronically low levels may contribute to cell injury during aging.
In children, low (or even absent) levels of serum uric acid do not
appear to have any detrimental clinical effects, but high levels cause
problems. Uric acid is normally near its limits of solubility in the body,
so even small increases risk precipitation in vulnerable regions. The
joints are one of these vulnerable regions, because of the low pH of
synovial fluid. Such precipitates can cause an inflammatory arthritis
known as gout. These precipitates tend to occur in cool regions of the
body, such as distal joints of the toes. The typical presentation of gout is
acute inflammation of one joint, often the metatarsophalangeal joint of
the large toe, although any joint can be involved. Uric acid crystals also
precipitate in cool regions of the skin, forming tophi at tendon insertion points over joints or the pinna of the ear. These tophi appear as
visible and palpable subcutaneous masses. Excess uric acid is concentrated by the kidneys in the renal collecting system, where high levels
precipitate in two different ways. Microscopic crystals may produce an
inflammatory nephropathy with painless chronic renal failure. Larger
stones may cause urinary obstruction with acute renal colic, dysuria,
hematuria, and recurrent urinary infections. These pathologies may
also overlap in some cases.
Hyperuricemia and its pathologic consequences are common in
adults, especially males. These problems often reflect an inherited predisposition for high uric acid together with lifestyle related to diet and
exercise. Hyperuricemia and its consequences are very uncommon
in children. Their occurrence in children often signifies an underlying disorder of purine metabolism. Uric acid is a component of many
routine clinical chemistry screening panels. As a result, abnormal levels of uric acid often provide an early clue to one of these disorders
(Table 110.2). Kidney stones are common in adults, but they are very
uncommon in children. Nephrolithiasis and renal failure also provide
an important clue to disorders of uric acid and some other disorders
of purine and pyrimidine metabolism (Table 110.3). Some are rare
inherited disorders affecting specific biochemical pathways; others are
acquired or iatrogenic.

Individual Disorders

Individuals with renal hypouricemia have marked reductions in
serum uric acid (<2 μg/dL or <120 μM) from birth. The disorder
is autosomal recessive and caused by pathogenic variants in the
SLC22A12 or SLC2A9 genes, which code for transporters important
for renal retention of uric acid. Many affected individuals remain
asymptomatic for life. Some experience renal impairments after strenuous exercise because physical activity is associated with increased
purine turnover and transient elevations of serum uric acid. When a
sudden bolus of uric acid after exercise is concentrated quickly in the

947

renal collecting system, there is a transient risk for stones or “sludge”
with nephropathy. This sludge reflects a somewhat viscous mixture
of tiny stones and partly solubilized uric acid. Gout is uncommon in
renal hypouricemia.
Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy is an autosomal
dominant disorder that has been linked to pathogenic variants in
UMOD (uromodulin), REN (renin), MUC (mucin), or HNF-­1b (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b). All of these genes encode proteins involved in
renal handling of uric acid. Affected individuals present in childhood
or adolescence with hyperuricemia, renal failure, and/or gout. Individuals with pathogenic variants in the ABCG2 gene have reduced intestinal secretion of uric acid, along with chronic hyperuricemia and gout.
Overproduction of uric acid may also occur in inherited disorders
of carbohydrate metabolism. They include disorders associated with
pathogenic variants in ALDOB (aldolase B deficiency, hereditary fructose intolerance, fructosemia), SLC37A4 (glucose-­6-­phosphatase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type I, or von Gierke disease), AGL
(glycogen debranching enzyme deficiency, glycogen storage disease
type III, or Cori disease), PYGM (muscle glycogen phosphorylase
deficiency, glycogen storage disease type V, or McArdle disease), and
PFKM (muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency, or glycogen storage
disease type VII, or Tarui disease). These disorders may be associated
with chronic or episodic hyperuricemia, sometimes with gout or renal
impairments. Hyperuricemia is often triggered by exercise because the
metabolic defect impairs energy metabolism during muscle activity
and leads to catabolism of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Some disorders of uric acid are acquired rather than inherited.
Because uric acid is eliminated largely by the kidneys, acute or
chronic renal insufficiency may lead to hyperuricemia, which may
be severe. A transient but marked elevation of serum uric acid may
also occur in tumor lysis syndrome, where the treatment of hematologic malignancies is associated with sudden death of many cells in
a short period, leading to generation of large amounts of DNA and
RNA that are degraded into uric acid. The sudden bolus of uric acid
is rapidly concentrated by the kidneys, leading to a risk for kidney
stones, sludge, and renal failure. Relatively more modest increases
in serum uric acid have been associated with other childhood disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, Down syndrome,
asthma, cyanotic congenital heart disease, chronic hemolytic anemia,
and certain medications. Medications causing hyperuricemia include
thiazide diuretics, cyclosporine, and some anticonvulsants (valproate
and phenobarbital).

Treatment and Prognosis

All renal purine stones, including those made of uric acid, are radiolucent. Unless they calcify, they cannot be detected with plain films or
CT, so diagnosis may require ultrasound. Stones passed in the urine
may be collected and chemically analyzed. Treatment of small kidney
stones may require analgesics for renal colic and/or antibiotics for
associated urinary tract infection until the stones are eliminated in the
urine. Larger kidney stones may obstruct the urinary collecting system
and may require lithotripsy or surgical removal. Because uric acid is
more soluble in an alkaline environment, alkalinization of the urine
with potassium-­sodium citrate or sodium bicarbonate may be useful
for individuals at risk for recurrent stones.
The diagnosis of gout can be made finding typical birefringent crystals in an aspirate of joint fluid. Because purine stones are radiolucent,
chronic tophaceous gout may have a punched-­out appearance on plain
films of the joints, where the uric acid crystals have eroded normal
bone. The treatment of acute painful gout usually involves nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. However, for both gout and renal stones,
treatments directed at uric acid levels are essential to prevent recurrences that may lead to permanent joint damage or chronic renal insufficiency. Chronic hyperuricemia can be treated with three different
strategies. One strategy is to increase renal excretion of uric acid with
drugs such as probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, benzbromarone, or lesinurad. Another strategy is to use drugs that inhibit uric acid production
by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) such as allopurinol, febuxostat, and
topiroxostat. The third involves administration of recombinant uricase

(rasburicase or pegloticase), a nonhuman enzyme that can degrade
uric acid.
The best choices for treatment depend on the biologic mechanisms
causing excess uric acid. The many causes of hyperuricemia may be
divided into two groups. The first group involves renal underexcretion,
where hyperuricemia can be treated with uricosuric drugs or XOR
inhibitors. The second group involves renal overload, which includes
disorders where uric acid is overproduced in the body or underexcreted by the gut. Hyperuricemia associated with renal overload should
be treated with XOR inhibitors, not with uricosuric drugs that further
increase the burden of uric acid handled by the kidneys. Rasburicase is
usually reserved for the transient marked increases in serum uric acid
associated with tumor lysis syndrome. Pegloticase is usually reserved
for the treatment of gout resistant to other medications.
These medications are usually combined with generous hydration
to provide a constant flow of associated purine metabolites from the
body. A low-­purine diet is sometimes recommended as well. Some
foods contain large amounts of purines, such as dried or cured meats
(sardines, anchovies) and organ meats (thymus, kidney, liver). Fructose
and alcohol also should be avoided because they stimulate purine turnover and result in increased uric acid production.

The hereditary xanthinurias are a group of autosomal recessive disorders defined by high levels of xanthine in the urine, along with low or
nondetectable serum uric acid. The estimated incidence is 0.5-­1 per
100,000 live births. The metabolic abnormalities result from deficiency
of XOR, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine and xanthine into
uric acid (see Fig. 110.2). XOR exists in two forms, sometimes called
xanthine oxidase or xanthine reductase, both with a molybdenum-­
containing cofactor at the active site. These two forms are encoded
by the same gene. Xanthine oxidase is derived from posttranslational
modification of xanthine reductase.
Although the hereditary xanthinurias all result from XOR deficiency,
distinct molecular mechanisms define three different groups. Hereditary xanthinuria type I is caused by pathogenic variants in the XOR
gene. Hereditary xanthinuria type II is caused by pathogenic variants
in the MOCOS gene, which encodes molybdenum cofactor sulfurase, an
enzyme that sulfurates the molybdenum cofactor required for XOR as
well as the enzyme aldehyde oxidase. As a result, hereditary xanthinuria
type II is characterized by combined deficiency of XOR and aldehyde
oxidase. The third type of hereditary xanthinuria is caused by defects in
the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Molybdenum cofactor deficiency has been linked with four genes: MOCS1 (molybdenum cofactor synthase 1), MOCS2 (molybdenum cofactor synthase 2), MOCS3
(molybdenum cofactor synthase 3), and GPHN (gephyrin). MOCS1
accounts for two thirds of all cases. All are required for the synthesis
of the molybdenum cofactor, which is used by four enzymes including
XOR, aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime
reducing component. As a result, the molybdenum cofactor deficiencies
are characterized by the combined defects of all four enzymes.

Clinical Features

The clinical features of hereditary xanthinuria type I caused by isolated
XOR deficiency may be benign. Many individuals are asymptomatic.
The increased excretion of xanthine leads to kidney stones in approximately one third of individuals. These stones may develop any time
from early childhood through later adulthood. Clinical signs may be
acute with dysuria, hematuria, renal colic, or a history of recurrent
urinary tract infections. Alternatively, affected individuals may present
with acute or chronic renal failure. Xanthine stones, like other purine
stones, are radiolucent; they are detectable with ultrasound but may be
missed on abdominal plain films or CT unless they calcify. Some individuals may develop myopathy after strenuous exercise with xanthine
crystals in muscle because of the rapid turnover of purines associated
with exercise.
The clinical features of combined deficiency of XOR and aldehyde
oxidase in hereditary xanthinuria type II are similar to those of type I.
There appears to be no obvious clinical impact of the added deficiency
of aldehyde oxidase.

the globus pallidus. Eye findings may include ectopic lens, spherophakia, and nystagmus. Most die in early childhood.
Because uric acid is included in many routine blood chemistry
screening panels, the diagnosis of the hereditary xanthinurias often
starts with serendipitous identification of low or absent uric acid.
Instead, urinary xanthine and hypoxanthine are elevated. However,
xanthine is elevated more than hypoxanthine, because the latter can
be recycled by HGprt or cleared by the kidneys. In individuals with
hereditary xanthinuria type II with combined deficiency of XOR and
aldehyde oxidase, urinary methyl-­2-­pyridone-­carboxamide also is low
or absent. The characteristic pattern observed among individuals with
the molybdenum cofactor deficiencies includes low uric acid in serum
and urine along with high urinary xanthine, hypoxanthine, sulfite, and
S-­sulfocysteine. Enzymatic tests for XOR are feasible but not commonly used for clinical diagnosis. They require biopsy of the liver or
small bowel where the amounts of this enzyme reach high enough levels for measurement. A convenient test for aldehyde oxidase involves
assessing its ability to oxidize a test dose of allopurinol to oxypurinol.
Sulfite oxidase and molybdenum cofactor can be measured in liver or
fibroblasts. A molecular diagnosis can be made by finding pathogenic
variants in one of the relevant genes.

Treatment and Prognosis

The treatment of all hereditary xanthinurias involves generous hydration to constantly flush xanthine from the renal collecting system to
avoid stone formation. Hydration is sometimes combined with a low-­
purine diet.
Aside from palliative care, minimal success has been achieved with
numerous approaches to the treatment of the molybdenum cofactor
deficiencies. However, cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (fosdenopterin) can have a life-­changing impact on the normally serious consequences of molybdenum cofactor deficiency associated with MOCS1.
Treatment has been reported to normalize metabolic measures and
allow near-­normal development among individuals who start it at a
very early age before there is significant brain damage. It is approved
for use in individuals with MOCS1 defects by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

The clinical features of the molybdenum cofactor deficiencies are
more severe. Individuals often present with failure to thrive during
infancy, difficulties feeding, intractable seizures, psychomotor delay,
and microcephaly. Brain MRI may show diffuse atrophy or cerebellar
hypoplasia, multicystic encephalomalacia, and signal abnormalities of

949

Disorders associated with the HPRT1 gene are rare, with an overall
prevalence of approximately three cases per million. Inheritance is
X-­linked and recessive, although sporadic cases are not uncommon.
The gene encodes hypoxanthine-­guanine phosphoribosyl transferase
(HGprt), an enzyme responsible for two different reactions (see Fig.
110.2). In one reaction, the cosubstrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
(PRPP) is combined with the purine base hypoxanthine to produce
IMP. In the other reaction, PRPP is combined with guanine to produce GMP. IMP and GMP are then recirculated into the nucleotide
pools. When HGprt activity is impaired, its substrates accumulate.
Accumulation of PRPP leads to excessive drive of purine synthesis,
because PRPP is also used in the first and rate-­limiting reaction of the
de novo synthetic pathway. The substrates hypoxanthine and guanine
also accumulate, and they are ultimately catabolized to uric acid. The
combination of accelerated purine synthesis and increased catabolism
of hypoxanthine and guanine results in a marked overproduction of
uric acid. This overproduction of uric acid is responsible for several
clinical features of HPRT1-­associated disorders, including hyperuricemia, nephrolithiasis, gout, and tophi.
Overproduction of uric acid is not responsible for all the clinical
features of HGprt deficiency. Reduced HGprt activity also leads to
impaired recycling of hypoxanthine and guanine, with purine wasting.
This loss of purines may lead to purine deficiency, especially in tissues
where the synthetic pathway cannot compensate for purines lost due to
the failure of recycling. Erythrocytes lack a fully operational synthetic
pathway, so they are dependent on recycling purines taken up from the
blood to maintain purines. These observations may account for macrocytic anemia, which is common in HPRT1-­associated disorders.
A similar mechanism may occur in the brain, where purine recycling
is important because purine synthesis is relatively low. In individuals

950 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
with HGprt deficiency, overt structural malformations are not usually found when performing routine clinical CT or MRI of the brain.
Such studies are usually normal or they show only mild diffuse atrophy.
However, advanced imaging methods have revealed several abnormalities. Quantitative MRI-­based, voxel-­based morphometry has revealed
subjects with HPRT1-­associated disorders to have volume loss in several brain regions. Similar studies, along with diffusion tensor imaging MRI, have revealed diffuse loss of white matter. The basal ganglia
appear to be more affected than most other regions. In fact, PET scans
have revealed a significant reduction in markers associated with basal
ganglia dopamine systems.
Autopsy studies of the brains of individuals with HPRT1-­associated
disorders do not show signs of maldevelopment or neurodegeneration. Dopamine neurons are present, but they do not express normal
levels of dopamine-­related markers. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia
is thought to be responsible for several of the neurologic features of
HPRT1-­
associated disorders, including dystonia and self-­
injurious
behavior. Dysfunction of corticospinal pathways may be responsible
for cognitive impairment, spasticity, and seizures.

Clinical Features

Pathologic genetic variants in HPRT1 are associated with a spectrum
of clinical phenotypes (Fig. 110.4). Most cases are males, although rare
females with defects in both HPRT1 alleles have been described. More
than 600 different gene variants are known. A complete loss of HGprt
function is associated with most of these variants, such as deletions,
insertions, nonsense substitutions, and some single amino acid substitutions. A partial loss of HGprt function is associated with other variants, usually conservative single amino acid substitutions and some
splice variants.
The severity of the clinical phenotypes is related to the degree of
associated enzyme impairment. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes
is usually subdivided into three overlapping groups. HPRT1 variants
associated with a mean value of 12% of normal HGprt activity are associated with the mildest clinical phenotype. This phenotype is known as
HGprt-­related hyperuricemia. These individuals experience overproduction of uric acid, along with associated problems of hyperuricemia,
nephrolithiasis, gout, and tophi. These individuals do not have overt
neurologic or behavioral problems, although mild clumsiness or mild
cognitive impairments may be disclosed with careful testing. The age
at presentation ranges from infancy to adulthood, usually with renal
problems or gout.
HPRT1 variants associated with a mean of 7% of normal HGprt activity are associated with an intermediate phenotype with overproduction
of uric acid along with clinically overt neurologic impairments. This
phenotype is known as HGprt-­related neurologic dysfunction. Motor
impairments vary widely and may range from minor clumsiness to a
phenotype that resembles severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Cognitive
deficits may range from attention-­deficit disorder to moderate intellectual disability. These individuals typically present with delayed motor
development, although some present with renal problems or gout.
HPRT1 variants associated with a mean value of 1% normal HGprt
activity are associated with the most severe phenotype, known as
Lesch-­Nyhan disease. These individuals have overproduction of uric
acid, disabling motor impairments, moderate intellectual disability,
and an unusual behavioral syndrome. The motor problems begin with
delayed development in infancy and evolve similar to severe dyskinetic
cerebral palsy. Epilepsy is common. The most characteristic aspect
of the behavioral syndrome is severe recurrent self-­injury, with self-­
biting, self-­hitting, recurrent scratching or poking, and others. Self-­
injury typically begins between 2 and 4 years of age but may be delayed
until the teenage years. Other difficult behaviors are also common,
such as impaired attention and impulsivity. Difficult behaviors may be
also directed toward others. They include use of language that is foul,
sexually inappropriate, or racially charged. Also frequent are hitting,
grabbing, or spitting.
The diagnosis of any HPRT1-­associated disorder should be suspected in a child or young adult with evidence for overproduction
of uric acid such as hyperuricemia, uric acid nephrolithiasis, or gout.

Uric acid (pink) crystals in diapers during infancy are frequently the
first clue. Suspicion for an HPRT1-­associated disorder increases when
there is evidence for overproduction of uric acid along with a history of
delayed motor development. The emergence of self-­injurious behavior
between 2 and 4 years of age often provides a more specific clue for
Lesch-­Nyhan disease. A definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of
a pathogenic variant in the HPRT1 gene and/or enzymatic evidence for
reduced HGprt function.

Treatment and Prognosis

For all HPRT1-­associated disorders, excessive production of uric acid
must be treated to avoid renal complications and gouty arthritis. Treatment requires a lifelong combination of an inhibitor of XOR to reduce
production of uric acid and generous hydration. The commonly used
XOR inhibitor is allopurinol, although others can also be used. Doses
are titrated to maintain serum uric acid within normal limits. Stones
may continue to form despite treatment, and lithotripsy or surgical
removal is sometimes required. High doses of XOR inhibitors that
reduce serum uric acid to very low levels are discouraged, because
this approach increases the risk of stones composed of the precursors
xanthine and hypoxanthine. Some specialists advocate alkalinization
of the urine to promote solubility of uric acid or a low-­purine diet to
reduce intake of purines that are metabolized to uric acid.
The motor disorder is dominated by dystonia, sometimes with spasticity. The increased muscle tone associated with these problems is
most often treated with muscle relaxants such as benzodiazepines or
baclofen. Anticholinergics and dopamine-­related drugs are not generally successful. Several case reports describe great success with deep
brain stimulation surgery, but the rate of surgical complications is
unusually high, and the overall risk-­benefit ratio does not favor universal recommendation of this approach.
The behavioral problems require a combination of physical protective devices, specific behavioral modification techniques, and sometimes
pharmacotherapy. Most individuals with Lesch-­Nyhan disease require
regular restraints of the hands and arms to prevent self-­hitting and biting of the fingers. Approximately half of all individuals require tooth
removal to prevent biting of the lips and tongue. A custom-­designed
wheelchair with dangerous regions shielded is often needed. The most
useful behavioral techniques involve extinction (ignoring) and redirection (distraction). Methods that use positive reinforcement are useful,
but methods that use negative reinforcement amplify negative behaviors.
Individuals with the mildest clinical phenotypes may have a normal
life span, provided uric acid is well-­managed. Those with more severe
phenotypes have a shorter life span, with death occurring in the teens
through the fifth decade. Most frequent causes of death include aspiration pneumonia or complications from renal dysfunction. Cases of
sudden unexplained death have also been reported.

APRT-­ASSOCIATED DISORDERS

Disorders associated with the APRT gene are rare, with fewer than
1,000 individuals reported. More than 200 pathogenic variants have
been described. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. The disorder has
been reported worldwide, but there are clusters of individuals with the
same genetic variants originating in Japan, France, and Iceland.
The APRT gene encodes adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT),
an enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing a reaction in which PRPP
is combined with the purine base adenine to produce AMP (see Fig.
110.2). Deficiency of APRT leads to accumulation of adenine, which
is metabolized by XOR into 2,8-­dihydroxyadenine (DHA). DHA does
not accumulate in serum because it is rapidly cleared by the kidneys.
Because solubility of DHA is poor, it precipitates in the urinary collecting system as either small crystals or larger stones. Small crystals cause
chronic renal insufficiency because they provoke tubulointerstitial
nephritis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Larger stones may cause acute
obstructive renal failure.

Clinical Features

Clinical manifestations are attributable to the kidneys, and they
may develop in a wide age range from infancy through adulthood.

all groups, but severity correlates with overall phenotypic subgroup. This schematic provides only a general guide, as some exceptions may occur.
(Copyright H.A. Jinnah.)

Approximately half of individuals with APRT deficiency have no symptoms, or symptoms may develop only in old age. The initial presentations fall into two groups which may overlap: nephrolithiasis and DHA
nephropathy. Individuals with nephrolithiasis may present acutely with
dysuria, hematuria, renal colic, or recurrent urinary tract infections.
They may describe accompanying crystals, larger stones, or gravel in
the urine. The precipitates are often reddish-­brown in color and easily
crushed. Alternatively, DHA nephropathy may result in a more slowly
evolving renal insufficiency, with approximately 15% first presenting
with end-­stage renal failure.
The diagnosis should be suspected when there is evidence for
crystalluria or nephrolithiasis, especially in a child. DHA stones, like
other purine stones, are radiolucent. Unless they calcify, they may be
detected via ultrasound but not with abdominal plain films or CT. The
diagnosis may also be suspected in individuals with unexplained renal
failure who undergo renal biopsy revealing a crystallopathy with tubulointerstitial nephritis, inflammation, and/or fibrosis. APRT deficiency
must be distinguished from other disorders that involve nephrolithiasis
and/or renal failure.
Commonly used clinical biochemical methods may not be able to
distinguish DHA stones from other purine stones, but more specific
methods have been developed at some specialized centers. DHA crystals in the urine can also be identified by light and polarizing microscopy, along with infrared spectrophotometry. Crystals in renal biopsy
specimens can be identified by polarizing microscopy with infrared
microscopy. Definitive diagnosis can also be achieved by measuring
APRT enzyme activity in erythrocytes or by documenting pathogenic
variants in the APRT gene.

Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment requires an inhibitor of XOR to reduce production of DHA.
The commonly used XOR inhibitors include allopurinol or febuxostat,
and they must be continued lifelong. Generous hydration is useful to
flush purine metabolites through the renal collecting system. A low-­
purine diet is sometimes recommended. Large stones may require
lithotripsy or surgical removal. Individuals who are diagnosed early in

life and adhere to therapy may have a normal life span. Individuals who
are diagnosed late may have chronic renal insufficiency or even renal
failure that requires dialysis or kidney transplantation.

DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH AMP-­DEAMINASE

The enzyme AMP-­deaminase catalyzes the deamination of AMP to
IMP with simultaneous production of NH3. The IMP can then be recirculated either to AMP or GMP (see Fig. 110.2). The enzyme is encoded
by three homologous genes. AMPD1 is expressed predominantly in
muscle, AMPD2 is broadly expressed with high levels in the brain, and
AMPD3 is broadly expressed at high levels in bone marrow cells. Each
gene has been associated with genetic variants producing null enzyme
activity.

Clinical Features

For AMPD1, approximately 20% of White and Black individuals have
a c.34C>T variant producing an early termination codon (p.Q12>X) in
exon 2. In these populations, 1–2% are homozygotes with null enzyme
activity in muscle. Most homozygotes have no symptoms, but myopathic features have been reported for some. These features include
exercise intolerance with fatigue or myalgia, sometimes with muscle
cramping or increased serum creatine kinase. Symptoms may begin
at any age from early childhood to later adulthood. Histochemical
stains for AMP-­deaminase are negative in muscle biopsy specimens,
but frank myopathic features are usually lacking. Because of the large
numbers of nonsymptomatic individuals, the role of the genetic variant
in causing symptoms is not clear. The variant may be benign, or it may
combine with other genes or factors to cause symptoms. A diagnosis
can be made via the forearm exercise test with measures of lactate and
NH3 production, histochemical staining of the enzyme in a muscle
biopsy, or finding a variant in the AMPD1 gene.
For AMPD2, pathogenic variants have been linked with pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH9). This neurologic disorder is rare, with
fewer than 50 cases reported worldwide. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is
a group of disorders described by dysgenesis of the pons and cerebellum. Individuals with the PCH9 subtype also have dysgenesis of the

952 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
corpus callosum and microcephaly. Clinical symptoms include severe
psychomotor delay, central visual impairment, and seizures.

ADSL-­ASSOCIATED DISORDERS

Disorders associated with the ADSL gene are rare, with fewer than
100 individuals reported. The disorder is autosomal recessive. Pathogenic gene variants with complete loss of enzyme activity are likely
incompatible with life. The pathogenic variants associated with disease produce a partial loss of enzyme function. The enzyme is bifunctional, and it mediates two distinct reactions in purine synthesis (see
Fig. 110.2). Reduced enzyme function leads to accumulation of succinylpurines (succinyl-­
aminoimidazole carboxamide riboside and
succinyl-­adenosine), which are eliminated in the urine. Historically,
this disorder was therefore called succinyl-­purinuria. The clinical manifestations are thought to result predominantly from pathologic effects
of succinyl purines in the brain. Brain MRI reveals varied findings from
nearly normal to global or regional atrophy with delayed myelination.

Clinical Features

The clinical manifestations are often described in three distinct groups,
but the groups overlap with a graded spectrum of severity. The most
severely affected group is described as a fatal neonatal encephalopathy. These individuals have a severe paucity of spontaneous movement
from birth, intractable seizures, and respiratory failure. They die within
the first weeks of birth. Individuals in the intermediate group (type I)
present with hypotonia and motor delay. They survive for longer periods, with moderate to severe psychomotor delay and seizures. Abnormal behaviors have been described as autistic with poor eye contact,
repetitive stereotyped movements or sounds, and frequent agitation.
The least severely affected group is referred to as type II. They present
within the first years of life with evidence for psychomotor delay, sometimes with seizures and behavioral problems. The diagnosis is made by
finding elevated succinyl purines in urine or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
or by finding pathogenic variants in the ADSL gene.

Treatment and Prognosis

Treatment is palliative. Seizures may be refractory to conventional
anticonvulsants, but some success has been reported with the ketogenic diet.

OTHER INHERITED PURINE DISORDERS
Adenosine Deaminase

Deficiency of adenosine deaminase results in severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID), with defects in both humoral (B
cells) and cellular (T cells) immunity. Individuals with severe SCID
present shortly after birth with life-­threatening infections. Individuals with milder disease may present at 2-­4 years of age, or even older
(see Chapter 165.1). In contrast with adenosine deaminase deficiency,
superactivity of the same enzyme causes hemolytic anemia.
Adenosine kinase. Adenosine kinase is sometimes considered
among the purine salvage enzymes because it recycles adenosine into
adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Pathogenic variants of the associated ADK gene in multiple cases from independent families have been
linked with hypermethioninemia, psychomotor delay, seizures, and
multiple dysmorphic features. The disorder is autosomal recessive.
Adenylate kinase. There are four isoforms of adenylate kinase
encoded by genes AK1-­4. The enzyme phosphorylates AMP to ADP
(see Fig. 110.2). The AK1 gene is highly expressed in erythrocytes.
Pathogenic variants in AK1 in multiple cases from independent families have been linked with nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, sometimes with cognitive disability.
The AK2 gene is more broadly expressed but localizes to mitochondria. Pathogenic variants in AK2 in multiple cases from independent
families have been linked with reticular dysgenesis, a type of SCID,
often with sensorineural hearing loss. Disorders associated with AK1
and AK2 are autosomal recessive.
Adenylosuccinate synthase. The ADSS gene encodes adenylosuccinate synthase, an enzyme involved in the conversion of IMP to AMP
(see Fig. 110.2). There are multiple isoforms, and pathogenic variants

in ADSSL1 have been linked with a form of myopathy, MPD5. The
disorder is autosomal recessive, usually begins in adolescence, and is
slowly progressive. One study of affected individuals indicated that distal leg weakness was the most common feature, often with weakness
of the hands. Approximately one third had weakness of the face or jaw
muscles leading to difficulty with mastication. Some had left ventricular hypertrophy. Involvement of the diaphragm may lead to respiratory
insufficiency in later stages of the illness.
ATIC-­associated disorders. Disorders associated with the ATIC
gene are very rare. Only four cases from three families have been
reported. The disorder is autosomal recessive. The enzyme is bifunctional and mediates two distinct reactions (see Fig. 110.2). Complete
loss of the enzyme is probably incompatible with life. Reduced enzyme
function leads to accumulation of ZMP along with its phosphorylated
derivatives. ZMP and its derivatives can be detected with the Bratton-­
Marshall test, a routinely used neonatal screen in some countries. All
reported cases had prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, severe to
profound psychomotor delay, chorioretinal atrophy with severe visual
impairment, and dysmorphic facial features. Some had epilepsy. Treatment is palliative.
Deoxyguanosine kinase. The DGK gene encodes deoxyguanosine
kinase, an enzyme that phosphorylates deoxypurine nucleosides into
their respective deoxynucleotides for DNA synthesis (see Fig. 110.2).
The gene is encoded by the nucleus, but the enzyme functions in
mitochondria. Gene defects lead to an impairment of mitochondrial
DNA synthesis, so the disorder is classified among the mitochondrial
DNA depletion disorders. The disorder is rare and inherited in an
autosomal recessive fashion. The clinical features reflect an early-­
onset multiorgan disorder, most notably liver failure, and psychomotor delay.
IMPDH-­associated disorders. IMP-­dehydrogenase is an enzyme
that stands at a branchpoint in purine metabolism, directing the
synthesis of purines toward guanine-­based nucleotides rather than
adenine-­based nucleotides (see Fig. 110.2). This enzyme has two isoforms encoded by distinct but homologous genes. The IMPDH1 gene
is expressed primarily in the retina, whereas the IMPDH2 gene is
expressed in most other tissues. Disorders associated with these genes
are rare, with only a handful of families reported.
Pathogenic variants in IMPDH1 have been linked with autosomal
dominant retinopathy. Affected individuals may have severe congenital retinal dysfunction with vision loss and pendular nystagmus (Leber
congenital amaurosis, LCA11). Others have childhood-­onset retinitis
pigmentosa with progressive visual impairment (retinitis pigmentosa,
RP10). There are no known treatments for either IMPDH-­associated
disorder.
Pathogenic variants in IMPDH2 have been linked with an autosomal
dominant neurologic disorder. Affected individuals may present with
developmental delay, infantile dystonia, and seizures. Others present
with a milder phenotype of dystonia that emerges in childhood or adolescence. There are no known treatments.
Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase. The PAICS gene
encodes a bifunctional enzyme that mediates two steps in the synthesis
of purines (see Fig. 110.2). Pathogenic variants associated with PAICS
are very rare, with only two individuals from a single family identified
by exome sequencing. Both had multiple craniocervical malformations, and one had additional limb malformations. Both died within a
few days of birth from respiratory failure.
Purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Deficiency of purine nucleoside
phosphorylase results in selective dysfunction of T cells with susceptibility to viral illnesses. Two thirds have neurologic abnormalities, and
one third have anemia. This disorder is covered in more detail in Chapter 165.2.

DISORDERS OF PYRIMIDINE METABOLISM
CAD Deficiency

The CAD gene encodes a trifunctional enzyme that mediates three of
the initial six steps in pyrimidine synthesis (see Fig. 110.3). The disorder takes its name from the three relevant enzymatic activities, which
include carbamoyl-­phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase,

Chapter 110 u Disorders of Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism
and dihydroorotase. The associated clinical disorder is autosomal
recessive.

Clinical Features

Fewer than 10 cases have been reported. Most presented in infancy
with developmental delay, anisocytosis, and poikilocytosis. Most had
medication-­refractory seizures by 2 years of age, although epilepsy may
start later. Many cases had global or cerebellar brain atrophy on MRI.
The disorder cannot be identified by any of the metabolic tests routinely used for clinical diagnosis, but the activity of the enzyme can be
measured. The disorder can also be identified by finding pathogenic
variants in the CAD gene.

Treatment and Prognosis

Although it is quite rare, early diagnosis is important because treatment with uridine produces remarkably positive outcomes. Most of
the subjects who were treated experienced a significant reduction in
seizures, correction of hematologic abnormalities, and partial reversal
of neurodevelopmental impairments. The disorder is therefore sometimes called uridine-­responsive epileptic encephalopathy. It is likely
that the degree of improvement depends on instituting treatments
before significant brain damage occurs.

Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

The DHODH gene encodes an enzyme that mediates the fourth of six
steps in pyrimidine synthesis. The enzyme is localized in mitochondria, where electrons from the dehydrogenase are transferred to ubiquinone in the electron transport chain. A complete loss of the enzyme
is not compatible with life, so all affected cases have had some residual
enzyme function. The disorder is autosomal recessive.

Clinical Features

Fewer than 100 cases have been reported. Affected individuals have
Miller syndrome, one of the acrofacial dysostosis syndromes where
dysmorphic facial features are combined with abnormalities of the
distal limbs. The facial anomalies include malar hypoplasia (underdeveloped cheekbones), micrognathia (small jaw), orofacial clefts
(incomplete fusion of the roof of the mouth or lips), hypoplastic lower
eyelids, and cup-­shaped ears. The limb anomalies include abnormalities of the fifth and/or fourth fingers and toes (webbing, fusion, or
hypoplasia), short forearms (ulnar hypoplasia sometimes with fusions
to the radius), and hypoplasia of the fibula. Some cases also have other
structural abnormalities such as pectus excavatum, rib defects, accessory nipples, or involvement of internal organs.

Treatment and Prognosis

There are no specific treatments for this disorder.

Hereditary Orotic Aciduria

The UMPS gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme that mediates two of
the last six steps in pyrimidine synthesis (see Fig. 110.3). The relevant
enzymatic activities are carried out by a single protein and include
orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5′-­monophosphate
decarboxylase. These activities are sometimes combined under the
term UMP synthase, and the disorder is sometimes known as UMP synthase deficiency. Affected individuals cannot convert orotic acid into
UMP, so they excrete large amounts of orotic acid in the urine. Levels
may be so high that orotic acid crystals may precipitate in the renal collecting system. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.

Clinical Features

The disorder is rare, with fewer than 50 reported cases. Most present in
the first few weeks or months of age with failure to thrive and developmental delay. The majority have megaloblastic anemia, hypochromia,
anisocytosis, and poikilocytosis. A few have had strabismus, congenital malformations, or seizures. Heterozygous carriers may excrete high
levels of orotic acid without any additional symptoms.
The diagnosis is often first suspected by finding high levels of orotic
acid in the urine. UMP synthase deficiency is not the only condition

953

associated with high urinary orotic acid. Other disorders include urea
cycle defects (e.g., ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), some mitochondrial disorders, Reye syndrome, or treatment with medications
(allopurinol and 6-­azauridine). A definitive diagnosis of hereditary
orotic aciduria comes from genetic testing that reveals pathogenic variants in the UMPS gene, and the enzyme can be measured in blood cells
or fibroblasts.

Treatment and Prognosis

Although rare, early diagnosis is important because it is treatable with
uridine. In general, supplements with uridine can reverse hematologic
abnormalities and stimulate normal growth and development. Long-­
term treatments are associated with good results. Uridine triacetate is
approved for treatment by the FDA.

Thymidine Phosphorylase Deficiency

The TYMP gene encodes thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme responsible for converting thymidine to thymine (see Fig. 110.3). Deficiency of
the enzyme results in marked elevations in blood thymidine. The disorder is autosomal recessive. Accumulation of phosphorylated derivatives
of thymidine and deoxyuridine result in abnormal DNA replication in
mitochondria and depletion of mitochondrial DNA. The enzyme has
had two additional names used in the literature prior to its isolation and
molecular identification. It is known as platelet-­derived endothelial cell
growth factor because of its angiogenic properties. It also is known as
gliostatin because of a suppressive effect on the growth of glia.

Clinical Features

The disorder is rare and responsible for mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE). Symptoms begin in adolescents or young adults. Initial symptoms are often attributable to the
gastrointestinal system and include diarrhea, vomiting, malabsorption,
weight loss, and episodes of pseudoobstruction. Neurologic features
include progressive external ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, myopathy, neuropathy, and hearing loss.

Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for the early-­onset severe phenotype.
Treatment with 5-­fluorouracil and related drugs is contraindicated.

DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE DEHYDROGENASE
DEFICIENCY

The DPD gene encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the first
enzyme involved in the catabolism of thymine and uracil (see Fig.
110.3). Genetic variants are common. Screening studies have suggested a prevalence of 3–5% for partial deficiency and 0.1–0.5% for
severe deficiency. Severe enzyme deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and it is associated with marked elevations of
thymine and uracil in urine, blood, and CSF. The associated disorder is
therefore sometimes called thiamine-­uraciluria.

Clinical Features

The clinical manifestations are quite varied, even among individuals who
carry the same genetic variant. Some individuals with severe enzyme
deficiency have no symptoms, and they are identified in adulthood
because of severe toxicity after treatment with 5-­flurouracil or related
drugs. Others are identified in childhood, although fewer than 50 cases
have been reported. Approximately half of these cases have had psychomotor delay, often with seizures. A few have presented with growth
restriction, microcephaly, ocular abnormalities, or autistic behaviors.

Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for the early-­onset severe phenotype. For
individuals with partial deficiency, treatment with 5-­fluorouracil and
related drugs is contraindicated.

Dihydropyrimidinase Deficiency

The DPYS gene encodes dihydropyrimidinase, the second enzyme
involved in the catabolism of thymine and uracil (see Fig. 110.3).

954 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Approximately 9% of individuals of European ancestry have genetic
variants that substantially reduce enzyme activity, and 0.5% have
almost no activity. Associated disorders are autosomal recessive. Severe
enzyme deficiency is associated with marked elevations of dihydrothymine and dihydrouracil and in urine, blood, and CSF. The associated
disorder is therefore sometimes called dihydropyrimidinuria.

Clinical Features

Genetic variants in DPYS are associated with very different clinical
manifestations, even among individuals who carry the same genetic
variant. The severe form of the disorder is rare, with fewer than 50
reported individuals. Some individuals with severe enzyme deficiency
have no symptoms. Others are identified in childhood, with approximately half having psychomotor delay and a third having seizures.
Gastrointestinal problems are common and include feeding difficulties
with recurrent vomiting, malabsorption, and gastroesophageal reflux.
A few have presented with growth restriction, microcephaly, or autistic
behaviors.

Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for the early-­onset severe phenotype.
Testing for common genetic variants before the use of 5-­fluorouracil
and related drugs has been recommended.

β-­Ureidopropionase Deficiency

The UPB1 gene encodes β-­ureidopropionase, also known as β-­alanine
synthase. It is responsible for the last step of pyrimidine catabolism
(see Fig. 110.3). Deficiency of the enzyme leads to accumulation of
N-­carbamoyl-­β-­alanine and N-­carbamyl-­β-­
aminoisobutyric acid in
urine, blood, and CSF. As a result, the disorder is sometimes called N-­
carbamoyl-­β-­amino aciduria. The mechanism by which the enzyme
defect leads to clinical disease is not well known.

Clinical Features

The disorder is autosomal recessive and rare, with fewer than 50
reported individuals. Affected individuals have psychomotor delay,
seizures, microcephaly, and autistic behaviors. However, enzyme
screening has revealed some individuals with no apparent symptoms.
Diagnosis can be made by measuring accumulation of the associated
metabolites, enzyme testing from liver biopsy, or finding pathogenic
variants in the gene.

Treatment and Prognosis

There is no specific treatment for this disorder.

DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH THYMIDINE
KINASE

Dividing cells rely on de novo synthesis of pyrimidines to make
most of their nucleotides, but these pathways are downregulated in
postmitotic cells, which primarily maintain pyrimidine nucleotides
instead via salvage (see Fig. 110.3). Salvage enzymes include cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1 gene) and mitochondrial thymidine
kinase (TK2 gene). The TK1 gene is often overexpressed in rapidly
dividing cells and used as a marker for early detection or recurrence
of cancer.
Pathogenic variants in the TK2 gene impair the phosphorylation
of thymidine and deoxycytosine, leading to reductions in associated
nucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. The result is abnormalities in
the rate and/or accuracy of mitochondrial DNA synthesis, with mitochondrial DNA depletion. Disorders associated with TK2 are autosomal recessive, with three overlapping groups delineated by age at onset.
Individuals with infantile onset (<1 year) have severe myopathy with
proximal muscle weakness, facial diplegia, dysphagia, and respiratory
compromise. Some may also have encephalopathy and seizures. Death
usually occurs within 1-­4 years. Individuals with the childhood-­onset
form (up to 12 years of age) have a more slowly progressive myopathy
with weakness and longer survival periods. Those with late onset (>12
years of age) may have limited areas of weakness such as chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia, facial diplegia, or oropharyngeal weakness.

There is no known treatment, but trials with relevant pyrimidine derivatives have been initiated.

COMBINED DISORDERS OF BOTH PURINES AND
PYRIMIDINES
PRPS1-­Associated Disorders

The PRPS1 gene encodes the enzyme PRPP synthase type 1. Two additional isoforms of this enzyme are encoded by separate genes: PRPS1L1
and PRPS2. PRPS1 and PRPS2 reside on opposite arms of the X chromosome, and PRPS1L1 is on chromosome 7. PRPS1 is ubiquitously
expressed. PRPS1L1 is expressed only in testis, and PRPS2 is expressed in
the gastrointestinal system, endocrine tissues, and reproductive organs.
Only PRPS1 has been linked with human disease. PRPS1-­associated disorders are rare, with fewer than 1,000 individuals reported.
All three isoforms of PRPP-­synthase transfer high-­energy phosphate bonds from ATP to ribose-­5-­phosphate to generate PRPP. The
PRPP can then use the high-­energy phosphate bonds to drive certain
energy-­requiring reactions. PRPP is a cosubstrate for the first and rate-­
limiting reaction in purine synthesis (see Fig. 110.2). PRPP also serves
as a cosubstrate for the main purine salvage enzymes HGprt and APRT.
PRPP affects pyrimidine synthesis as well, because it is a cosubstrate
for the first step in pyrimidine synthesis (see Fig. 110.3). PRPP is also a
cosubstrate for two additional enzymes involved in the synthesis of the
pyridine nucleotides: NAD and NADP (Table 110.4). PRPP-­synthase
plays a key role in regulating the synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines, and overexpression of PRPS1 is common in certain cancer cells,
which need large quantities of purines and pyrimidines for DNA replication during cell division.
Because of its integral involvement in many vital biochemical pathways, complete loss of PRPP-­synthase is not compatible with life.
Instead, clinical disease results from abnormally high enzyme activity
or partial loss of enzyme activity. High levels of the enzyme produce
excessive quantities of PRPP, and elevations in PRPP accelerate purine
production, with resultant overproduction of uric acid. It is likely that
increases in PRPP accelerate pyrimidine metabolism, but measures
of this pathway are not widely used in clinical medicine. Conversely,
impaired enzyme activity results in reduced metabolism of both
purines and pyrimidines.

Clinical Features

The clinical phenotypes of PRPS1-­associated disorders are remarkably
diverse. Phenotypic variation is caused by varied changes in enzyme
function. The phenotypes associated with reduced enzyme activity
historically have been described as distinct entities, although clinical
features overlap, and the reality is a continuous spectrum of severity (Fig. 110.5). The mildest phenotype is X-­linked nonsyndromic
hearing loss (DFN2). Hearing impairments in males may range from
a slowly progressive postlingual hearing loss to profound congenital
deafness. A more severe phenotype associated with impaired enzyme
activity has been called Rosenberg-­Chutorian syndrome or X-­linked
Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease (CMTX5). This phenotype in males
combines prelingual hearing loss, progressive optic neuropathy, and
peripheral neuropathy beginning at 5-­10 years of age and sometimes
gait impairments. An even more severe phenotype has been called Arts
syndrome. It also is X-­linked, and males have profound congenital
deafness, early-­onset optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, psychomotor delay, and recurrent respiratory infections that may cause early
death. In addition to these three phenotypes classically associated with
reduced enzyme activity, there are reports that suggest a fourth and
even more severe phenotype. Males have intrauterine growth restriction and failure to thrive after birth, congenital retinopathy and deafness, diabetes insipidus, and a more severe neurologic condition that
includes severe psychomotor delay, spastic tetraparesis, seizures, and
evidence for delayed white matter development on brain MRI.
The PRPS1 gene is X-­linked, so variants associated with reduced
PRPP-­synthase affect males, often from an early age. However, female
carriers may express milder or adult-­onset phenotypes. In families
where males are affected only with early-­onset hearing loss, female
carriers may develop progressive hearing loss as young adults. In

Chapter 110 u Disorders of Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism
families where males have a more severe early childhood phenotype
that includes additional neurologic signs, female carriers may have
progressive hearing loss, retinopathy, optic neuropathy, peripheral
neuropathy, and sometimes additional signs attributable to the central
nervous system. For the most severe phenotype, female carriers may
also have short stature. In some families, only females are clinically
affected, with evidence for embryonic lethality of males. These families suggest the existence of a fifth phenotype of embryonic lethality
in males. Because hearing loss is the most consistent feature associated with reduced PRPP-­synthase, the diagnosis of a PRPS1-­associated
disorder should be considered in males or females with sensorineural
hearing loss, especially when combined with other neurologic signs.
There are also two different phenotypes associated with abnormally
high levels of PRPP-­synthase activity. The milder phenotype is associated with overexpression of a normal PRPS1 mRNA transcript. Males
present with signs of uric acid overproduction, including hyperuricemia and gout. Female carriers may also be affected. A more severe
phenotype is associated with a point pathogenic variant in PRPS1,
which renders the protein less durable but insensitive to feedback
inhibition. The lack of feedback inhibition results in excessive PRPP
production, with acceleration of purine synthesis and overproduction
of uric acid. However, tissues with normally low levels of PRPS1 may
experience PRPP shortage because the enzyme is unstable. Erythrocytes lack a nucleus, so there is no ongoing mRNA transcription to provide a constant supply of new enzyme. In individuals with an unstable
enzyme, erythrocyte PRPP-­synthase is absent. A similar mechanism
may explain the neurologic consequences, which overlap with those of
PRPP-­synthase deficiency syndromes. Affected individuals show signs
of overproduction of uric acid combined with sensorineural hearing
impairments, neuropathy, and/or psychomotor delay. The diagnosis of
a disorder associated with excessive activity of PRPP-­synthase should
be suspected in any individual with evidence for overproduction of
uric acid, especially when combined with the typical neurologic signs.

Treatment and Prognosis

The overproduction of uric acid in disorders associated with increased
activity of PRPP-­synthase is treated with inhibitors of XOR (allopurinol or febuxostat) combined with generous hydration. No treatments
have proven effective in the treatment of disorders associated with
reduced activity of the enzyme.

Disorders Associated with Nucleotidases

There are numerous enzymes that function as nucleotidases to remove
phosphate groups from nucleotides (see Figs. 110.1 and 110.3). Many
act nonselectively on multiple nucleotides and other small molecules,
but they are often described according to their most prominent (or first
discovered) enzymatic activity. At least five of these nucleotidases are

cytosolic, one is bound to the plasma membrane, and another is localized to mitochondria. Early studies based on enzymatic activity did
not always identify the exact isoform involved, but more recent studies
have more precisely delineated the precise enzyme involved.
Nucleotidase-­associated pervasive developmental delay. A marked
increase in nucleotidase activity was found in cells of nine individuals
with motor and cognitive delay, hyperactivity and impulsivity, delayed
or absent language, seizures, awkward movements, and other abnormal behaviors. Some had immunologic impairments too. Although the
exact enzyme and gene were not delineated, individuals had chronic
hypouricemia, indicating reduced purine metabolism. Biochemical
studies suggested the disorder was associated with depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides, and the behavioral abnormalities responded to uridine supplements.
Pyrimidine 5′-­nucleotidase deficiency. The NT5C3A gene encodes
an erythrocyte-­specific 5′-­nucleotidase isoform (P5N-­1) with preferential activity toward the pyrimidines CMP and UMP (see Fig. 110. 3).
Enzyme deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and
associated with accumulation of pyrimidine nucleotides in erythrocytes.
The clinical manifestations include chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia; marked basophilic stippling and reticulocytosis; and
accompanying splenomegaly, hemoglobinuria, and jaundice resulting
from overproduction of bilirubin. The diagnosis is suspected when
there is prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes, a phenomenon
also associated with lead intoxication. Erythrocytes have an overabundance of pyrimidines, and the enzyme can be measured in red cells. The
anemia is generally moderate and does not usually require transfusion.
Spastic paraplegia (SPG45). The NT5C2 gene encodes a cytosolic 5′-­
nucleotidase with preferential activity toward IMP and
other purine nucleotides. Pathogenic variants in this gene leading to
reduced enzyme function have been linked with spastic paraplegia
(SPG45). The disorder is rare and described for fewer than 20 individuals in a few different families. Affected individuals have early-­onset
gait impairment with leg weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus,
and extensor plantar reflexes. Many also have cognitive impairments.
MRI may show white matter brain changes with dysgenesis of the
corpus callosum.
Desbuqois dysplasia type 1 (DBQB1). The CANT1 gene encodes a
secreted calcium-­dependent enzyme that functions as a triphosphatase or diphosphatase with activity toward ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP.
Pathogenic variants in this gene have been linked with a rare form of
osteochondrodysplasia. Affected individuals have short stature with
short limbs, joint laxity with frequent joint dislocations, pectus carinatum, osteopenia, dysmorphic facies, and intellectual disability.

DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH RIBONUCLEOTIDE
REDUCTASE

Ribonucleotide reductase is the enzyme responsible for generating the
deoxynucleotides dADP, dCDP, dGDP, and dUDP (see Figs. 110.1 and
110.3). These deoxynucleotides are used to synthesize DNA, so the
enzyme plays a key role in regulating DNA replication for cell division.
The enzyme is the target for hydroxyurea used for sickle cell anemia
and certain malignancies. The human enzyme has three subunits, but
only the subunit encoded by the RRM2B gene has been linked with
human disease.

Clinical Features

Pathogenic variants in RRM2B are responsible for a mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndrome with severe encephalomyopathy. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Only a handful
of cases from a few families have been reported. Pathogenic variants
in the same gene have also been linked with an autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEOA5). Only a few
cases have been reported. There is no specific treatment for either
disorder.

Chapter 111

Hutchinson-­Gilford Progeria
Syndrome (Progeria)
Timothy R. O’Toole and Leslie B. Gordon
Hutchinson-­Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, or progeria) is a rare,
fatal, autosomal dominant segmental premature aging disease. With
an estimated incidence of 1 in 4 million live births and prevalence of
1 in 20 million living individuals, there are an estimated total of 400
children living with progeria in 2023 worldwide. There is no gender,
ethnic, or regional bias.
Progeria is caused by a single-­base pathogenic variant in the LMNA
gene, which results in the production of an abnormal lamin A protein
called progerin. Lamin A is an intermediate-­filament inner nuclear
membrane protein found in most differentiated cells of the body.
Without progerin-­directed treatment, children with progeria develop
premature progressive atherosclerosis and die of heart failure, usually
between ages 5 and 20 years. Progerin is found in increased concentration in the skin and vascular wall of normal older individuals compared with younger individuals, suggesting a role in normal aging.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Children are born looking normal and begin to develop clinical signs of
disease during year one. Physical appearance and clinical findings change

dramatically each year that they age (Figs. 111.1 and 111.2). Both clinical and biologic overlaps with aging are segmental, or partial. The disease features discussed next are roughly in order of clinical appearance.

Dermatologic Changes in Skin, Hair, and Nails

Skin findings are often apparent as initial signs of progeria—at birth
in about 25% of cases and by age 2 months in 80% of cases. These
are variable in severity and include areas of discoloration, stippled
dyspigmentation, tightened areas that can restrict movement, and
areas of the trunk or legs where small (1-­2 cm), soft, bulging skin
is present.
Although usually born with normal appearance, cranial hair is lost
within the first few years. Initial hair loss occurs in the temporal and
occipital areas, with preservation of hair on the mid-­scalp and vertex
for the longest period. Eventually total alopecia occurs, leaving soft,
downy, sparse, immature hair on the scalp, no eyebrows, and scant
eyelashes.
Nails on hands and feet are usually normal at birth but become
dystrophic later in life.

Failure to Thrive

Children with progeria experience apparently normal fetal and early
postnatal development. Between several months and 1 year of age,
abnormalities in growth and body composition are readily apparent. Severe failure to thrive ensues, heralding generalized lipoatrophy, with apparent wasting of limbs, circumoral cyanosis, and
prominent veins around the scalp, neck, and trunk resulting from a
paucity of subcutaneous fat. The weight percentile is usually normal
at birth but decreases to below the third percentile despite adequate
caloric intake for normal growth and normal resting energy expenditure. A review of 35 children showed an average weight increase

of only 0.44 kg/year, beginning at 24 months of age and persisting
through life. Weight gain over time is linear, which contrasts with
the pulsatile acceleration in growth velocity for normal age-­and
gender-­matched children. Children reach an average final height of
approximately 1 meter and weight of approximately 15-­20 kg. Head
circumference is normal. The weight deficit is more pronounced
than the height deficit and, associated with the loss of subcutaneous
fat, results in the emaciated appearance with muscular prominence.
Clinical problems caused by the lack of subcutaneous fat include
sensitivity to cold temperatures and foot discomfort caused by lack
of fat cushioning. Overt diabetes is unusual in progeria, but at least
75% of children eventually develop insulin resistance, usually starting at around age 8 years.

Musculoskeletal Impairments

Both upper and lower extremity range-­of-­motion impairments (e.g.,
fingers, elbows, hips, knees, ankles) may be present at birth and may
progress with age. Joint contractures are caused by both bony and cartilaginous disease, along with tightened skin. Along with irregularities
in the congruency of articulating joint surfaces, these changes serve
to limit joint motion and affect both upper and lower extremity gross
and fine motor function. Physical therapy is recommended routinely and
throughout life to maximize joint function.

Ocular Abnormalities

Ophthalmic signs and symptoms are caused in part by shallow
orbits, tight skin, and a paucity of subcutaneous fat around the eyes.
Eyes are prominent and often experience ocular surface disease

secondary to nocturnal lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy,
which produce photophobia, tearing, ocular irritation, corneal
scarring, and corneal ulceration that can lead to vison loss. Most
patients have relatively good acuity; however, advanced ophthalmic
disease can be associated with reduced acuity. Children with progeria should have an ophthalmic evaluation at diagnosis and at least
yearly thereafter. Aggressive ocular surface lubrication is recommended, including the use of tape tarsorrhaphy at night.

Craniofacial and Dental Phenotypes

Children develop craniofacial disproportion, with micrognathia
and retrognathia caused by mandibular hypoplasia. Typical oral and
dental manifestations include hypodontia, delayed tooth eruption,
severe dental crowding caused by hypoplastic maxilla and mandible, ogival palatal arch, ankyloglossia, presence of median sagittal
palatal fissure, and generalized gingival recession. Eruption may be
delayed for many months, and primary teeth may persist for the
duration of life. Secondary teeth are present but may or may not
erupt. They sometimes erupt on the lingual and palatal surfaces of
the mandibular and maxillary alveolar ridges, rather than in place
of the primary incisors. In some, but not all cases, extracting primary teeth promotes movement of secondary teeth into place.

Skeletal Abnormalities

Development of bone structure and bone density represents a
unique skeletal dysplasia that is not based in malnutrition. Acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, distal clavicular resorption, and
thin, tapered ribs are early signs of progeria (as early as 3 months

of age). Facial disproportion, a narrowed nasal bridge, and retrognathia make intubation extremely difficult, and fiberoptic intubation is
recommended. A pyriform chest structure and small clavicles can
lead to reducible glenohumeral joint instability. Growth of the spine
and bony pelvis is normal. Hip disease is pervasive and results in
repeated dislocations in about 20% of cases that are not amenable
to splinting. Dysplastic growth of the femoral head and neck axis
results in coxa valgus (straightening of the femoral head-­neck axis
>125 degrees) and coxa magna, where the diameter of the femoral head is disproportionately large for the acetabulum, resulting in
hip instability. The resulting hip dysplasia can be progressive and
may result in osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, hip dislocation, and
inability to bear weight.
In response to repeated hip dislocations, five instances of either
unilateral or bilateral surgical correction of hip dysplasia using periacetabular and femoral osteotomy have been conducted, each at different hospitals. Follow-­up after 4-8 years has yielded mixed results.

Other than in a single instance, hip dislocations have not recurred. In
two cases, postsurgical healing occurred normally, resulting in ability
to bear weight and walk short-­to-­long distances. In two cases, hardware failure with nonunion of femoral bone necessitated hardware
removal and new hardware insertion; skin breakdown and need for
additional bone grafting complicated one of these cases. These two
cases yielded limited weight-­bearing with no assistance when walking short distances, but the patients required wheelchair use for longer distances. Finally, one case healed well with no adverse events, but
mobility was not restored because of postsurgery progression of joint
contractures, resulting in inability to bear weight or walk and subsequent wheelchair use. Adequate vitamin D levels are likely important
for bone healing in all cases.
Other changes to the appendicular skeleton include flaring of
the humeral and femoral metaphyses and constriction of the radial
neck. Growth plate morphology is generally normal but can be
variable within a single radiograph. The appearance of ossification

centers used to define bone age is normal. Bone structure assessed
by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of the
radius demonstrates distinct and severe abnormalities in bone
structural geometry, consistent with progeria representing a skeletal
dysplasia. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) z scores measured by
dual-­energy x-­ray absorptiometry (DXA) adjusted for height and
age and true (volumetric) BMD assessed by pQCT are normal to
mildly reduced, refuting the assumption that patients with progeria are osteoporotic. Fracture rates in progeria are normal and not
associated with fragility fractures observed in other pediatric metabolic bone diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta.

Hearing

Low-­tone conductive hearing loss is pervasive in progeria and
likely indicative of a stiff tympanic membrane and/or deficits in
the middle ear bony and ligamentous structures. Overall, this does
not affect the ability to hear the usual spoken tones, but preferential classroom seating is recommended, along with annual hearing
examinations.

Cardiovascular Disease

Approximately 80% of deaths in progeria are caused by cardiovascular failure, with end-­stage events sometimes precipitated by
superimposed respiratory infection or stressors surrounding surgical intervention. Progeria is a primary vasculopathy characterized
by pervasive accelerated vascular stiffening, followed by large-­and
medium-­vessel occlusive disease from atherosclerotic plaque formation, with valvular and cardiac calcification and insufficiency
at advanced stages of disease. Some evidence of vascular dysfunction is apparent in all ages tested. ECG abnormalities are generally nonspecific, but indications of left ventricular hypertrophy
and nonspecific ST-­T wave abnormalities can occur later in disease
progression. Hypertension, angina, cardiomegaly, metabolic syndrome, and congestive heart failure are common end-­stage events.
Transthoracic echocardiography reveals early-­onset diastolic left
ventricular dysfunction associated with age-­related decline in lateral and septal early (E′) diastolic tissue Doppler velocity z scores
and an increase in the ratio of mitral inflow (E) to lateral and septal E′ velocity z scores. Other echocardiographic findings include
left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
and mitral or aortic valve disease with calcification, which tend to
appear later in life.
Vascular stiffening assessed using carotid and femoral ultrasound
reveals elevated carotid-­femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVcf ) and
wall echodensity with medial and adventitial thickening. These
are considered early and important indicators of cardiovascular
decline. In the general population, increased PWVcf is associated
with increased risk of cardiac death. Intima-­media thickness is
normal. In addition, elevated carotid artery mean flow velocities
appear early in life, and underscore the presence of arterial occlusive disease.
Routine blood pressure (BP) monitoring with special attention to
proper cuff size is recommended. When normalized for patient size
using height and age correction, both systolic and diastolic BP are
increased in about half of patients with HGPS. These elevated BP
trends would be expected in the setting of significant vascular stiffness. Antihypertensive medications have been used in the setting of
elevated BP, with special attention to maintaining adequate BP to
avoid strokes.
BP monitoring, ECG, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound for plaque
evaluation, and PWVcf measures for vascular stiffening are recommended.
End-­stage cardiovascular disease (CVD) in progeria is often characterized by atherosclerotic plaques in large and medium-­sized arteries, severe aortic stenosis, and cardiac failure. Critical aortic stenosis
with heart failure is amenable to transapical transcatheter aortic valve
implantation and apico-aortic conduit surgeries to alleviate severe aortic stenosis. These carry high risk of death but have yielded significant

symptomatic improvement and prolongation of life in several cases
(see treatment section).

Cerebrovascular Arteriopathy and Stroke

The earliest incidence of stroke occurred at age 0.4 years. More
often, strokes occur in the later years. Over the life span, MRI evidence of infarction can be found in as many as 60% of patients with
progeria, with half of these clinically silent. Both extracranial and
intracranial occlusive disease is present in the neurovascular axis,
with resulting extensive collateral vessel formation that pseudo-­
normalizes intracranial flow. Carotid artery blockages are well
documented, but infarction can occur even in their absence. Both
large-­and small-­vessel disease is found; collateral vessel formation
is extensive. A propensity for strokes and an underlying stiff vasculature make maintaining adequate blood pressure through oral
hydration a priority in patients with progeria; special care should be
taken when considering maintenance of consistent BP during general anesthesia, airplane trips, and hot weather. In addition, 15% of
deaths in children with progeria occur from head injury or trauma,
including subdural hematoma. This implies an underlying susceptibility to subdural hematoma, though known risk of stroke is much
higher and frequently warrants low-­dose aspirin therapy.

Sexual Development

Females with progeria can develop Tanner stage II secondary
sexual characteristics, including signs of early breast development
and sparse pubic hair. Progression to Tanner stage III has not been
observed. Despite minimal to absent physical signs of pubertal
development and markedly reduced body fat, over half of females
experience spontaneous menarche at a median age of 14 years.
Menarche is not preceded by gain in body mass or increase in body
fat. Timing of menarche is variable; some adolescents start menstruation at Tanner stage I without progression to Tanner II, while
others start at Tanner stage II. Those experiencing menarche vs
nonmenstruating females have similar body mass indices, percentage body fat, and serum leptin levels, all of which are vastly below
the healthy adolescent population. Menorrhagia has been observed
and can result in symptomatic anemia. In addition to iron supplementation, oral contraceptives may be indicated to regulate menses.
Progestin-­only or minimal estrogen-­content products are preferred
because of elevated cardiovascular risks associated with estrogen-­
based medication in the face of HGPS-­associated atherosclerosis.
There are no documented cases of reproductive capacity in females
or males with progeria; however, the data suggest there is potential for further sexual development and the possibility of fertility in
these females. Secondary sexual characteristics in males have not
been reported.

Normally Functioning Systems

Liver, kidney, thyroid, immune, gastrointestinal, and neurologic function (other than stroke related) remain intact. Intellect is normal for
age, possibly in part from downregulation of progerin expression in the
brain by a brain-­specific micro-­RNA, miR-­9.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The most consistent laboratory findings are low serum leptin below
detectable levels (>90%) and insulin resistance (75%, usually starting over age 8 years). Platelet count is often moderately high. High-­
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations
decrease with increasing age to values significantly below normal. Otherwise, lipid panels, high-­sensitivity C-­reactive protein, blood chemistries, liver and kidney function tests, endocrine test, and coagulation
tests are generally normal.

peptide chain, showing its central α-­helical rod domain and C-­terminal−CAAX box, representing cysteine (C), aliphatic amino acids (AA), and any
amino acid (X). The α-­helical rod domain is divided into segments that assist in displaying the progerin defect. Posttranslational processing consists
of four steps: (1) a farnesyl group is attached to the cysteine residue of the −CAAX box by farnesyltransferase; (2) the last three residues are proteolytically cleaved by the zinc metalloprotease Zmpste24 or Ras-­converting enzyme (RCE1); (3) carboxy-­methylation by isoprenyl-­cysteine carboxyl
methyltransferase (ICMT); and (4) the terminal 15 C-­terminal residues, including the farnesylated and carboxymethylated cysteine, are cleaved off
by Zmpste24. B, A 50–amino acid deletion in prelamin A (represented by the black segment of the lamin A rod) is the result of a pathogenic variant
that activates a cryptic splice site within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This deletion leaves progerin without an attachment site for the last processing
step—cleavage of the farnesylation and carboxymethylated terminal 15 amino acid residues. Thus progerin remains farnesylated and intercalated
within the inner nuclear membrane, where it causes much of its cellular damage.

A is associated with human diseases. The lamin proteins are the principal
proteins of the nuclear lamina, a complex molecular interface located
between the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope and chromatin.
The integrity of the lamina is central to many cellular functions, creating and maintaining structural integrity of the nuclear scaffold, DNA
replication, RNA transcription, organization of the nucleus, nuclear pore
assembly, chromatin function, cell cycling, senescence, and apoptosis.
Progeria is a sporadic autosomal dominant disease in about 98% of
cases. Two percent of cases presumably arise from parental mosaicism;
The Progeria Research Foundation reports five identified sibling occurrences of genetically confirmed HGPS. HGPS is caused by the accelerated use of an alternative, internal splice site that results in the deletion
of 150 base pairs in the 3′ portion of exon 11 of the LMNA gene. In
about 90% of cases, this results from a single C to T transition at nucleotide 1824 that is silent (Gly608Gly) but optimizes an internal splice
site within exon 11. The remaining 10% of cases possess one of several
single-­base pathogenic variants within the intron 11 splice donor site,
thus reducing specificity for this site and altering the splicing balance
in favor of the internal splice. Subsequent to all these pathogenic variants, translation followed by posttranslational processing of the altered
mRNA produces progerin, a shortened abnormal lamin A protein with
a 50–amino acid deletion near its C-­terminal end. An understanding
of the posttranslational processing pathway and how it is altered to create progerin has led to a number of treatment prospects for the disease
(Fig. 111.3).

Both prelamin A and preprogerin possess a methylated farnesyl
side group attached during posttranslational processing. This is a
lipophilic moiety that facilitates intercalation of proteins into the
inner nuclear membrane, where most of the lamin and progerin
functions are performed. During posttranslational processing of
normal lamin A, loss of the methylated farnesyl anchor releases
prelamin from the nuclear membrane, rendering it soluble for
autophagic degradation. However, preprogerin and, subsequently,
progerin retain the farnesyl moiety. Progerin remains anchored
to the membrane, binding other proteins, causing blebbing of the
nucleus, disrupting mitosis, and altering gene expression. Progerin
also retains a methyl moiety.
Disease in progeria is produced by a dominant negative mechanism; the action of progerin, not the diminution of lamin A, causes
the disease phenotype. The severity of disease is determined in part
by progerin levels, which are regulated by the particular pathogenic
variant, tissue type, or other factors influencing use of the internal
splice site.

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Overall, the constellation of small body habitus, bone, hair, subcutaneous fat, and skin changes results in the marked physical resemblance among patients with progeria (Fig. 111.4). For this reason, if
disease signs are present, clinical diagnosis can often be achieved or
excluded with relative confidence even at young ages. There are rare

cases of mosaicism or relatively low-­progerin-­expressing patients
with extremely mild clinical signs of disease. Thus lack of early disease manifestation should not be considered exclusionary. Clinical
suspicion should be followed by LMNA genetic sequence testing. In
addition, a number of premature aging disorders have features that
overlap with HGPS but are not progerin-­producing (Table 111.1).
Patients may fall under none of these diagnoses and represent ultra-­
rare, unnamed progeroid diseases that carry either non–progerin-­
producing pathogenic variants in LMNA or the lamin-­associated
enzyme (ZMPSTE24), or progeroid syndromes without lamin-­
associated pathogenic variants.

TREATMENT

Lonafarnib (Zokinvy) is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that blocks
the addition of a farnesyl lipid moiety onto preprogerin, thus preventing progerin from associating with the inner nuclear membrane
where it effects much of its damage (see Fig. 111.3). Lonafarnib is
approved by the US FDA and European Medicines Agency for use
in patients with HGPS and processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies ages 12 months and older. It is the first and only approved
indication for either disease. It is initiated at a dose of 115 mg/m2
orally twice daily. After four months, the dose is increased to 150
mg/m2 twice daily. The most common side effects are diarrhea, nausea, and loss of appetite, which can be mitigated with loperamide,
ondansetron HCl, and cyproheptadine, respectively.
Overall, children with HGPS treated with long-term lonafarnib
therapy demonstrated an increase in mean estimated survival of 4.3
years (30%) over untreated children. Treatment decreased plasma
progerin levels by an average of 38% starting at 4-6 months and
persisting for up to 10 years on therapy. In a single-arm clinical trial
with lonafarnib (NCT00425607), subgroups of patients experienced
increased rate of weight gain, decreased vascular stiffness measured
by decreased PWVcf and carotid artery echodensity, improved left
ventricular diastolic function, increased radial bone structural
rigidity, improved sensorineural hearing, and early evidence of
decreased headache, TIA, and stroke rates. Dermatologic, dental,
joint contracture, insulin resistance, lipodystrophy, BMD, and joint
contractures were unaffected by drug treatment.
Dosing: In general, medications should be dosed according to
weight or body surface area instead of age because of the small size and
decreased weight for height.

961

Hydration is important for maintaining adequate blood flow in the face
of generalized vascular stiffness and collateral vascular formation in the
brain.
Low-­dose aspirin therapy is recommended at 2 mg/kg/day, as an
extension of what is known about decreasing cardiovascular risk in
the general at-­risk adult population. It is not known whether low-­
dose aspirin therapy has any effect on morbidity or mortality in
HGPS.
Antihypertensive medications have been used with elevated BP,
with special attention to maintaining adequate BP to avoid strokes.
Due to small, thin body habitus, appropriately sized blood pressure
cuff and height-age adjustments when evaluating hypertension (>95th
percentile) should be employed.
Extraskeletal calcifications have been observed in patients
with progeria radiographically and cutaneously, both at a baseline off therapy (around 30% of patients) and with increasing frequency during a clinical trial when the patients were treated with
oral calcium carbonate supplementation, and/or zoledronic acid,
pravastatin, and lonafarnib (around 45% of patients). Oral calcium
carbonate supplementation may therefore aggravate calcium dysfunction in children with progeria. Given this potential concern,
calcium intake via dietary means, along with vitamin D supplementation, is likely the safest intake strategy.
Physical and occupational therapy initiation are recommended as
young as possible to preserve joint mobility and optimize capacity for
activities of daily living.
Cardiac intervention. A primary cause of mortality in HGPS is
critical aortic stenosis caused by premature atherosclerosis. At end
stage, high-risk intervention has been performed using transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for patients large enough to
receive the smallest valve available, using a transapical approach
because the femoral artery is small and calcified, precluding a transfemoral approach. The majority of patients’ aortic valves are too
small to implement TAVI. In these cases, apico-aortic conduit (aortic valve bypass) surgery has been achieved. Both procedures have
resulted in postoperative symptomatic relief and lifespan extension
when successful. The procedures carry high risk for perisurgical
morbidity and mortality.
Clinical trials. One currently ongoing clinical trial adding everolimus (an FDA-­approved mTOR inhibitor) to a lonafarnib regimen is
aimed at accelerating autophagy of progerin, thus theoretically reducing its accumulation and cellular damage (NCT02579044). Patient
treatment phase is complete and results are pending.

PROGNOSIS

Children with progeria develop a severe premature form of atherosclerosis. Before death, cardiac decline with left-­sided hypertrophy, valvular insufficiency, and pulmonary edema develop; neurovascular decline
with TIAs, strokes, and occasionally seizures can result in significant
morbidity.
Without lonafarnib drug treatment, death occurs generally
between ages 5 and 20 years, with a median life span of 14.5 years,
resulting from heart failure, sometimes with superimposed respiratory infection (approximately 80%); from head injury or trauma,
including subdural hematoma (approximately 15%); and, rarely,
from stroke (1–3%) or complications from anesthesia during surgery (1–3%). With lonafarnib therapy, long-term use has been
associated with up to 4.3 years’ (30%) lifespan extension. Surgical
intervention for critical aortic stenosis can decrease cardiovascular
morbidity and extend lifespan by an indeterminate duration.

Chapter 112 u The Porphyrias 963

Chapter 112

The Porphyrias
Manisha Balwani, Robert J. Desnick, and
Karl E. Anderson
Porphyrias are metabolic diseases resulting from altered activities of
specific enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway. These enzymes are
most active in bone marrow and liver. Erythropoietic porphyrias, in
which overproduction of heme pathway intermediates occurs primarily in bone marrow erythroid cells, usually present at birth or in early
childhood with cutaneous photosensitivity, or in the case of congenital
erythropoietic porphyria, even in utero as nonimmune hydrops. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is the most common porphyria in children.
Most porphyrias are hepatic, with overproduction and initial accumulation of porphyrin precursors or porphyrins in the liver. Activation of hepatic porphyrias is very rare during childhood, reflecting the
distinct hepatic regulatory mechanisms for heme biosynthesis that are
influenced by pubertal development. Homozygous forms of the hepatic
porphyrias may manifest clinically before puberty. Children who are
heterozygous for inherited hepatic porphyrias may present with nonspecific and unrelated symptoms, and parents often request advice
about long-­term prognosis and express concerns about drugs that may
exacerbate these conditions.

THE HEME BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY

Heme is required for a variety of hemoproteins, such as hemoglobin,
myoglobin, respiratory cytochromes, and cytochrome P450 enzymes
(CYPs). It is believed that the eight enzymes in the pathway for heme

biosynthesis are active in all tissues. Hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid
precursor cells accounts for approximately 85% of daily heme synthesis
in humans. Hepatocytes account for most of the rest, primarily for synthesis of CYPs, which are especially abundant in the liver endoplasmic
reticulum and turn over more rapidly than many other hemoproteins,
such as the mitochondrial respiratory cytochromes. Pathway intermediates are the porphyrin precursors δ-­aminolevulinic acid (ALA, also
known as 5-­aminolevulinic acid) and porphobilinogen (PBG), as well
as porphyrins (mostly in their reduced forms, known as porphyrinogens) (Fig. 112.1). These intermediates do not accumulate in significant amounts or have important physiologic functions under normal
conditions.
Altered activity of each enzyme in the pathway has been associated
with a specific type of porphyria (Table 112.1). The first enzyme, ALA
synthase (ALAS), occurs in two forms. An erythroid-­specific form,
ALAS2, is deficient in X-­linked sideroblastic anemia as a result of
pathogenic variants of the ALAS2 gene on chromosome Xp11.2. Gain-­
of-­function pathogenic variants of ALAS2 caused by deletions in the
last exon cause X-­linked protoporphyria (XLP), which is phenotypically identical to erythropoietic protoporphyria.
Regulation of heme synthesis differs in the two major heme-­forming
tissues. Liver heme biosynthesis is primary controlled by the ubiquitous
form of ALAS (ALAS1). Synthesis of ALAS1 in liver is regulated by a
“free” heme pool (see Fig. 112.1), which can be augmented by newly
synthesized heme or by existing heme released from hemoproteins and
destined for breakdown to biliverdin by heme oxygenase.
In comparison, in the hematopoietic system, novel regulatory
mechanisms allow the production of the very large amounts of heme
needed for hemoglobin synthesis. The response to stimuli for hemoglobin synthesis occurs during cell differentiation, leading to an increase
in cell number. Also, unlike the liver, heme has a stimulatory role in
hemoglobin formation, and the stimulation of heme synthesis in erythroid cells is accompanied not only by increases in ALAS2 but also
by sequential induction of other heme biosynthetic enzymes. Separate

by feedback repression (dashed red arrow).

†PCT is a result of inhibition of hepatic UROD. Autosomal dominant inheritance of a partial deficiency of UROD is a predisposing factor in cases defined as familial (type 2) PCT. Other
genetic factors, such as HFE pathogenic variants, are sometimes found in all types of PCT.
‡ADP and HEP are considered primarily hepatic porphyrias, but substantial increases in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin suggest an erythropoietic component.

erythroid-­specific and nonerythroid, or “housekeeping,” transcripts are
known for the first four enzymes in the pathway. The separate forms of
ALAS are encoded by genes on different chromosomes, but for each of
the other three, erythroid and nonerythroid transcripts are transcribed
by alternative promoters in the same gene. Heme also regulates the rate
of its synthesis in erythroid cells by controlling the transport of iron
into reticulocytes.
Intermediates of the heme biosynthetic pathway are efficiently converted to heme and, normally, only small amounts of the intermediates are excreted. Some may undergo chemical modifications before
excretion. Whereas the porphyrin precursors ALA and PBG are colorless, nonfluorescent, and largely excreted unchanged in urine, PBG
may degrade to colored products such as the brownish pigment called
porphobilin or spontaneously polymerize to uroporphyrins. Porphyrins are red in color and display bright-­red fluorescence when exposed
to long-­wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light. Porphyrinogens are the
reduced form of porphyrins and are colorless and nonfluorescent, but
are readily autoxidized to the corresponding porphyrins when they
accumulate or are outside the cell. Only the type III isomers of uroporphyrinogen and coproporphyrinogen are converted to heme (see
Fig. 112.1).
ALA and PBG are excreted in urine. Excretion of porphyrins and
porphyrinogens in urine or bile is determined by the number of carboxyl groups. Those with many carboxyl groups, such as uroporphyrin
(octacarboxyl porphyrin) and heptacarboxyl porphyrin, are water soluble and readily excreted in urine. Those with fewer carboxyl groups,
such as protoporphyrin (dicarboxyl porphyrin), are not water soluble
and are excreted in bile and feces. Coproporphyrin (tetracarboxyl

porphyrin) is excreted partly in urine and partly in bile. Because coproporphyrin I is more readily excreted in bile than coproporphyrin III,
impaired hepatobiliary function may increase total urinary coproporphyrin excretion and the ratio of these isomers.

CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF PORPHYRIAS

Two useful classification schemes reflect either the underlying pathophysiology or the clinical features of porphyrias (see Table 112.1).
In hepatic porphyrias and erythropoietic porphyrias the source of
excess production of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins is the liver
and bone marrow, respectively. Acute porphyrias cause neurologic
symptoms that are associated with increases of one or both of the porphyrin precursors, ALA and PBG. In the cutaneous porphyrias, photosensitivity results from transport of porphyrins in blood from the
liver or bone marrow to the skin. Dual porphyria refers to the very
rare cases of porphyria with deficiencies of two different heme pathway
enzymes.
Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), acute intermittent porphyria
(AIP), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) are the three most
common porphyrias, in that order, considering all age-­groups, and are
very different in clinical presentation, precipitating factors, methods
of diagnosis, and effective therapy (Table 112.2). Two less common
acute porphyrias, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate
porphyria (VP), can also cause blistering photosensitivity (see Table
112.1). Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) causes more
severe blistering lesions, often with secondary infection and mutilation. EPP and X-­linked protoporphyria (XLP) have the same phenotype and are distinct from the other cutaneous porphyrias in causing

First-­Line Laboratory Diagnostic Testing

A few sensitive and specific first-­
line laboratory tests should be
obtained whenever symptoms or signs suggest the diagnosis of porphyria. If a first-­line or screening test is significantly abnormal, more
comprehensive testing should follow to establish the type of porphyria.
Overuse of laboratory tests for screening can lead to unnecessary
expense and even delay in diagnosis. In patients who present with a
past diagnosis of porphyria, laboratory reports that were the basis for
the original diagnosis must be reviewed, and if these were inadequate,
further testing considered.
Acute porphyria should be suspected in patients with neurovisceral
symptoms such as abdominal pain after puberty, when initial clinical evaluation does not suggest another cause. Urinary PBG should
be measured. Urinary PBG is virtually always increased during acute
attacks of AIP, HCP, and VP and is not substantially increased in any
other medical conditions. Therefore this measurement is both sensitive and specific. Results from spot (single-­void) urine specimens are
highly informative because very substantial increases are expected during acute attacks of porphyria. A 24-­hour collection can unnecessarily delay diagnosis. The same spot urine specimen should be saved for
quantitative determination of PBG (expressed relative to creatinine) to
confirm the qualitative PBG result. ALA is often measured as well, but
is usually less elevated than PBG in AIP, HCP, and VP. In ALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP), urinary ALA and porphyrins, but not PBG,
are greatly elevated. Measurement of urinary porphyrins in addition to
PBG is recommended to screen for acute porphyrias because PBG is often
less elevated and returns to normal more rapidly in HCP and VP than in
AIP. Porphyrin measurement alone should be avoided for screening, however, because it is often increased in many disorders other than porphyrias, such as liver diseases, and misdiagnoses of porphyria can result from
increases in urinary porphyrins that have no diagnostic significance.

Blistering Cutaneous Porphyrias

Blistering skin lesions caused by porphyria are virtually always accompanied by increases in total plasma and urinary porphyrins. Porphyrins in plasma in VP are mostly covalently linked to plasma proteins
and readily detected by a diagnostic peak in a fluorescence scanning method. The normal range for plasma porphyrins is somewhat
increased in patients with end-­stage renal disease.

Nonblistering Cutaneous Porphyria

Measurement of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin and, if the total
amount is elevated, fractionation of protoporphyrin into its metal-­free
and zinc-­chelated forms, is essential for diagnosis of EPP and XLP.
Unfortunately, this is not offered by some major commercial laboratories. Results of zinc protoporphyrin measurements are often recorded
(even in the same report) as both protoporphyrin and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, with each calculated differently, based on past
practices for screening for lead poisoning (which only increases zinc

protoporphyrin). Thus the obsolete term free protoporphyrin does not
mean metal-­free protoporphyrin, because it was defined as iron-­free
protoporphyrin and dates from before it was known that (except in
protoporphyrias) protoporphyrin in erythrocytes is mostly zinc chelated. This unnecessary confusion makes diagnosis and reliable exclusion of protoporphyrias difficult. Total plasma porphyrins are elevated
in most, but not all, cases of protoporphyria, so a normal level should
not be relied on to exclude protoporphyria when total erythrocyte protoporphyrin is elevated.
Increases in erythrocyte total and zinc-­chelated protoporphyrin
occur in many other conditions, including iron deficiency, lead poisoning, hemolysis, anemia of chronic disease, and other erythrocyte
disorders. Therefore the diagnosis of EPP must be confirmed by showing a predominant increase in free and metal-­free protoporphyrin. In
XLP, both free and zinc protoporphyrin are elevated.

Second-­Line Testing

More extensive testing is well justified when a first-­line test is positive.
A substantial increase in PBG may be caused by AIP, HCP, or VP, and
these can be distinguished by measuring urinary porphyrins (using the
same spot urine sample), fecal porphyrins, and plasma porphyrins. The
various porphyrias that cause blistering skin lesions are differentiated
by measuring porphyrins in urine, feces, erythrocytes, and plasma.
Confirmation by genetic testing is important once the diagnosis is established by biochemical testing.

Testing for Subclinical Porphyria

It is often difficult to diagnose or rule out porphyria in patients who
had suggestive symptoms months or years in the past and in asymptomatic relatives of patients with acute porphyrias because porphyrin
precursors and porphyrins may be normal. More extensive testing and
consultation with a specialist laboratory and physician may be needed.
Before evaluating relatives, the diagnosis of porphyria should be firmly
established in an index case and the laboratory results reviewed to
guide the choice of tests for the family members. Identification of a
disease-­causing pathogenic variant in an index case greatly facilitates
detection of additional gene carriers because biochemical tests in latent
carriers may be normal.

δ-­AMINOLEVULINIC ACID DEHYDRATASE–
DEFICIENT PORPHYRIA

ALA dehydratase–deficient porphyria (ADP) is sometimes termed
Doss porphyria after the investigator who described the first cases.
The term plumboporphyria emphasizes the similarity of this condition to lead poisoning, but incorrectly implies that it is caused by lead
exposure.

Etiology

This porphyria results from a deficiency of ALA dehydratase (ALAD),
which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Only eight cases have
been confirmed by pathogenic variant analysis. The prevalence of heterozygous ALAD deficiency was estimated to be <1% in Germany and
approximately 2% in Sweden.

966 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Pathology and Pathogenesis

ALAD catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of ALA to form
the pyrrole PBG (see Fig. 112.1). The enzyme is subject to inhibition
by a number of exogenous and endogenous chemicals. ALAD is the
principal lead-­binding protein in erythrocytes, and lead can displace
the zinc atoms of the enzyme. Inhibition of erythrocyte ALAD activity
is a sensitive index of lead exposure.
Eleven abnormal ALAD alleles, most with point pathogenic variants, have been identified, some expressing partial activity, such that
heme synthesis is partially preserved. The amount of residual enzyme
activity may predict the phenotypic severity of this disease.
ADP is often classified as a hepatic porphyria, although the site of
overproduction of ALA is not established. A patient with severe, early-­
onset disease underwent liver transplantation without significant clinical or biochemical improvement, which might suggest that the excess
intermediates did not originate in the liver. Evidence suggests this
disease may have an erythropoietic component. Excess urinary coproporphyrin III in ADP might originate from metabolism of ALA to
porphyrinogens in a tissue other than the site of ALA overproduction.
Administration of large doses of ALA to normal individuals also leads
to substantial coproporphyrinuria. Increased erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, as in all other homozygous porphyrias, may be explained
by accumulation of earlier pathway intermediates in bone marrow
erythroid cells during hemoglobin synthesis, followed by their transformation to protoporphyrin after hemoglobin synthesis is complete.
Neurologic symptoms are attributed to neurotoxic effects of ALA, but
this is unproven.

Clinical Manifestations

In most cases, symptoms resemble other acute porphyrias, including
acute attacks of abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy. Precipitating factors, such as exposure to harmful drugs, have not been evident
in most cases. Six of the reported cases were adolescent males. A Swedish infant had more severe disease, with neurologic impairment and
failure to thrive. A 63-­year-­old man in Belgium developed an acute
motor polyneuropathy concurrently with a myeloproliferative disorder. A Dutch patient with symptom onset in infancy presented in
adulthood with acute symptoms and progressive asymmetric weakness
of both extremities.

Laboratory Findings

Urinary ALA, coproporphyrin III, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin are substantially increased. Urinary PBG is normal or slightly
increased. Erythrocyte ALAD activity is markedly reduced, and both
parents have approximately half-­normal activity of this enzyme and
normal urinary ALA.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

The other three acute porphyrias are characterized by substantial
increases in both ALA and PBG. In contrast, ALA, but not PBG, is
substantially increased in ADP. A marked deficiency of erythrocyte
ALAD and half-­normal activity in the parents support the diagnosis. Other causes of ALAD deficiency, such as lead poisoning, must
be excluded. Succinylacetone accumulates in hereditary tyrosinemia
type 1 and is structurally similar to ALA, inhibits ALAD, and can cause
increased urinary excretion of ALA and clinical manifestations that
resemble acute porphyria. Idiopathic acquired ALAD deficiency has
been reported. Unlike lead poisoning, the deficient ALAD activity in
ADP is not restored by the in vitro addition of sulfhydryl reagents such
as dithiothreitol. Even if no other cause of ALAD deficiency is found,
it is essential to confirm the diagnosis of ADP by molecular studies.

Treatment

Treatment experience with ADP is limited but is similar to other acute
porphyrias. Glucose seems to have minimal effectiveness but may be
tried for mild symptoms. Hemin therapy was apparently effective
for acute attacks in male adolescents, and weekly infusions prevented
attacks in two of these patients. Hemin was not effective either biochemically or clinically in the Swedish child with severe disease, and it

produced a biochemical response but no clinical improvement in the
Belgian man with a late-­onset form, who had a peripheral neuropathy
but no acute attacks. Hemin is also effective in treating porphyria-­like
symptoms associated with hereditary tyrosinemia and can significantly
reduce urinary ALA and coproporphyrin in lead poisoning. Avoidance of drugs that are harmful in other acute porphyrias is advisable.
Liver transplantation was not effective in the child with severe disease.
In a recent report, weekly blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide
were used in addition to heme-­arginate to suppress erythroid heme
synthesis.

Prognosis

Recurrent attacks may occur and require repeated treatment with
hemin. The course was unfavorable in the Swedish child with more
severe disease and was uncertain in adults with late-­onset disease associated with myeloproliferative disorders.

Prevention and Genetic Counseling

Heterozygous parents should be aware that subsequent children are at
risk for ADP, as in any autosomal recessive disorder. Prenatal diagnosis
is possible but has not been reported.

ACUTE INTERMITTENT PORPHYRIA

AIP is also termed pyrroloporphyria, Swedish porphyria, and intermittent acute porphyria and is the most common type of acute porphyria
in most countries.

Etiology

AIP results from the deficient activity of the housekeeping form of
porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). This enzyme is also known as
hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) synthase (the prior term, uroporphyrinogen I synthase, is obsolete). HMB synthase catalyzes the deamination and head-­to-­tail condensation of four PBG molecules to form
the linear tetrapyrrole, HMB (also known as preuroporphyrinogen; see
Fig. 112.1). A unique dipyrromethane cofactor binds the pyrrole intermediates at the catalytic site until six pyrroles (including the dipyrrole
cofactor) are assembled in a linear fashion, after which the tetrapyrrole
HMB is released. The apo-­deaminase generates the dipyrrole cofactor
to form the holodeaminase, and this occurs more readily from HMB
than from PBG. Indeed, high concentrations of PBG may inhibit formation of the holodeaminase. The product HMB can cyclize nonenzymatically to form nonphysiologic uroporphyrinogen I, but in the
presence of the next enzyme in the pathway is more rapidly cyclized to
form uroporphyrinogen III.
Erythroid and housekeeping forms of the enzyme are encoded by a
single gene. The two isoenzymes are both monomeric proteins, differ
only slightly in molecular weight (approximately 40 and 42 kDa), and
result from alternative splicing of two distinct messenger RNA (mRNA)
transcripts that arise from two different promoters. The housekeeping
promoter functions in all cell types, including erythroid cells.
The pattern of inheritance of AIP is autosomal dominant, with
very rare homozygous cases that present in childhood. More than 400
HMBS pathogenic variants, including missense, nonsense, and splicing
pathogenic variants, and insertions and deletions have been identified
in AIP and in many population groups. Most pathogenic variants are
found in only one or a few families. Because of founder effects, some
are more common in certain geographic areas, such as northern Sweden (W198X), Holland (R116W), Argentina (G116R), Nova Scotia
(R173W), and Switzerland (W283X). De novo pathogenic variants
may be found in approximately 3% of cases. The nature of the HMBS
pathogenic variant does not account for the severity of the clinical presentation, which varies greatly within families. Chester porphyria was
initially described as a variant form of acute porphyria in a large English family but was found to be caused by an HMBS pathogenic variant.
Most pathogenic variants lead to approximately half-­normal activity
of the housekeeping and erythroid isozymes and half-­normal amounts
of their respective enzyme proteins in all tissues of heterozygotes. In
approximately 5% of unrelated AIP patients, the housekeeping isozyme
is deficient, but the erythroid-­specific isozyme is normal. Pathogenic

variants causing this are usually found within exon 1 or its 5′ splice
donor site or initiation of translation codon.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

Induction of the rate-­limiting hepatic enzyme ALAS1 is thought to
underlie acute exacerbations of this and the other acute porphyrias.
AIP remains latent (or asymptomatic) in the great majority of those
who are heterozygous carriers of HMBS pathogenic variants, and this is
almost always the case before puberty. In those with no history of acute
symptoms, porphyrin precursor excretion is usually normal, suggesting that half-­normal hepatic HMBS activity is sufficient unless hepatic
ALAS1 activity is increased. Patients can also be asymptomatic with
elevated levels of porphyrin precursors and are classified as asymptomatic high excretors. These patients may have a remote history of
symptoms. Many factors that lead to clinical expression of AIP, including certain drugs and steroid hormones, have the capacity to induce
hepatic ALAS1 and CYPs. When hepatic heme synthesis is increased,
half-­normal HMBS activity may become limiting, and ALA, PBG, and
other heme pathway intermediates may accumulate. In addition, heme
synthesis becomes impaired, and heme-­mediated repression of hepatic
ALAS1 is less effective.
It is not proved, however, that hepatic HMBS remains constant at
approximately 50% of normal activity during exacerbations and remission of AIP, as in erythrocytes. An early report suggested that the
enzyme activity is considerably less than half-­normal in the liver during an acute attack. Hepatic HMBS activity might be reduced further
once AIP becomes activated if, as suggested, excess PBG interferes
with assembly of the dipyrromethane cofactor for this enzyme. It also
seems likely that currently unknown genetic factors play a contributing
role in, for example, patients who continue to have attacks even when
known precipitants are avoided.
AIP is almost always latent before puberty and becomes active
mostly in adult females, which suggests that endocrine factors, and
especially adult levels of female steroid hormones, may be important
for clinical expression. Premenstrual attacks are probably the result of
endogenous progesterone. Acute porphyrias are sometimes exacerbated by exogenous steroids, including oral contraceptive preparations
containing progestins. Surprisingly, pregnancy is usually well tolerated,
suggesting that beneficial metabolic changes may ameliorate the effects
of high levels of progesterone.
Drugs that are unsafe in acute porphyrias (Table 112.3) include
those with the capacity to induce hepatic ALAS1, which is closely associated with induction of CYPs. Some chemicals (e.g., griseofulvin) can
increase heme turnover by promoting the destruction of specific CYPs
to form an inhibitor (e.g., N-­methyl protoporphyrin) of ferrochelatase
(FECH, the final enzyme in the pathway). Sulfonamide antibiotics are
harmful but apparently not inducers of hepatic heme synthesis. Ethanol and other alcohols are inducers of ALAS1 and some CYPs.
Nutritional factors, in particular reduced intake of calories and
carbohydrates, as may occur with illness or attempts to lose weight,
can increase porphyrin precursor excretion and induce attacks of
porphyria. Increased carbohydrate intake may ameliorate attacks.
Hepatic ALAS1 is modulated by the peroxisome proliferator-­activated
receptor-­γ coactivator-­1α, which is an important link between nutritional status and exacerbations of acute porphyria.
Other factors have been implicated. Chemicals in cigarette smoke,
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, can induce hepatic CYPs
and heme synthesis. A survey of AIP patients found an association
between smoking and repeated porphyric attacks. Attacks may result
from metabolic stress and impaired nutrition associated with major
illness, infection, or surgery. Clinical observations suggest an additive
effect of multiple predisposing factors, including drugs, endogenous
hormones, nutritional factors, and smoking.

Neurologic Mechanisms

The mechanism of neural damage in acute porphyrias is poorly understood. The most favored hypothesis at present is that one or more heme
precursors, or perhaps a derivative, are neurotoxic. Increased ALA
in AIP, HCP, VP, ADP, plumbism, and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1,

which have similar neurologic manifestations, suggests that this substance or a derivative may be neuropathic. Porphyrins derived from
ALA after its uptake into cells may have toxic potential. ALA can also
interact with γ-­
aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Severe AIP
greatly improves after allogeneic liver transplantation. This experience
and the demonstration that recipients of AIP livers develop porphyria
support the hypothesis that heme precursors from the liver cause the
neurologic manifestations.

Epidemiology

AIP occurs in all ethnic groups and is the most common acute porphyria, with an estimated prevalence in most countries of 5 in 100,000.
In Sweden, prevalence was estimated to be 7.7 in 100,000, including latent cases with normal porphyrin precursors. A much higher
prevalence of 60-­100 in 100,000 in northern Sweden is the result of
a founder effect. The combined prevalence of AIP and VP in Finland
is approximately 3.4 in 100,000. Population screening by erythrocyte
HMBS activity or DNA analysis revealed a prevalence of 200 heterozygotes per 100,000 people in Finland and 1 in approximately 1,675 (60
in 100,000) in France. Studies using exomic/genomic databases show
that the estimated frequency of pathogenic variants in the HMBS gene
is 0.00056 (56 in 100,000), suggesting that the penetrance of this disorder may be as low as 1% and that carriers of HMBS pathogenic variants
that can cause AIP are much more common than previously believed.
Higher penetrance in some families with AIP suggests a strong role of
environmental factors and genetic modifiers.

Clinical Manifestations

Neurovisceral manifestations of acute porphyrias may appear any time
after puberty, but rarely before it (Table 112.4). Porphyria attacks are
exceedingly rare before the onset of puberty. Affected children are
more often males as opposed to affected adolescents and adults, who
are predominantly females. Reported symptomatic childhood cases
often lacked adequate biochemical and molecular confirmation. The
prepubertal attacks in males may be explained in part by coexisting
medical conditions with the potential to upregulate ALAS1. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom in such cases,
but seizures, often preceding the diagnosis, were also common. Other
manifestations reported in children include tachycardia, peripheral
neuropathy, myalgias, hypertension, irritability, lethargy, and behavioral abnormalities. A population-­based study in Sweden indicated
that symptoms suggestive of porphyria may occur in heterozygotes
during childhood, even, in contrast to adults, when urinary porphyria
precursors are not elevated. This study did not compare the frequency
of such nonspecific symptoms in a control group of children. Very rare
cases of homozygous AIP present differently, with severe neurologic
manifestations early in childhood.
Acute attacks in adults are characterized by a constellation of nonspecific symptoms, which may become severe and life threatening.
Abdominal pain occurs in 85–95% of AIP patients and is usually
severe, steady, and poorly localized, but is sometimes cramping, and
accompanied by signs of ileus, including abdominal distention and
decreased bowel sounds. Nausea, vomiting, and constipation are common, but increased bowel sounds and diarrhea may occur. Bladder
dysfunction may cause hesitancy and dysuria. Tachycardia, the most
common physical sign, occurs in up to 80% of attacks. This is often
accompanied by hypertension, restlessness, coarse or fine tremors,
and excess sweating, which are attributed to sympathetic overactivity
and increased catecholamines. Other common manifestations include
mental symptoms; pain in the extremities, head, neck, or chest; muscle
weakness; and sensory loss. Because all these manifestations are neurologic rather than inflammatory, there is little or no abdominal tenderness, fever, or leukocytosis.
Porphyric neuropathy is primarily motor and appears to result
from axonal degeneration rather than demyelinization. Sensory
involvement is indicated by neuropathic pain in the extremities,
which may be described as muscle or bone pain, and by numbness,
paresthesias, and dysesthesias. Paresis may occur early in an attack but
is more often a late manifestation in an attack that is not recognized

*Porphyria has been listed as a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse
effect in U.S. labeling for these drugs. Estrogens are also listed as harmful in
porphyria but have been implicated as harmful in acute porphyrias, mostly based
only on experience with estrogen-­progestin combinations. Although estrogens can
exacerbate porphyria cutanea tarda, there is little evidence they are harmful in the
acute porphyrias.
†Porphyria has been listed as a precaution in U.S. labeling for this drug. However, this
drug is regarded as safe by other sources.

and adequately treated. Rarely, severe neuropathy develops when
there is little or no abdominal pain. Motor weakness most commonly
begins in the proximal muscles of the upper extremities and then progresses to the lower extremities and the periphery. It is usually symmetric, but occasionally asymmetric or focal. Initially, tendon reflexes
may be little affected or hyperactive and become decreased or absent.
Cranial nerves, most often X and VII, may be affected, and blindness from involvement of the optic nerves or occipital lobes has been
reported. More common central nervous system (CNS) manifestations include seizures, anxiety, insomnia, depression, disorientation,
hallucinations, and paranoia. Seizures may result from hyponatremia,
porphyria itself, or an unrelated cause. Chronic depression and other
mental symptoms occur in some patients, but attribution to porphyria
is often difficult.
Hyponatremia is common during acute attacks. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion is often the most likely

mechanism, but salt depletion from excess renal sodium loss, gastrointestinal (GI) loss, and poor intake have been suggested as causes
of hyponatremia in some patients. Unexplained reductions in total
blood and red blood cell volumes are sometimes found, and increased
ADH secretion might then be an appropriate physiologic response.
Other electrolyte abnormalities may include hypomagnesemia and
hypercalcemia.
The attack usually resolves within several days unless treatment is
delayed. Abdominal pain may resolve within a few hours and paresis within a few days. Even severe motor neuropathy can improve
over months or several years but may leave some residual weakness.
Progression of neuropathy to respiratory paralysis and death seldom
occurs with appropriate treatment and removal of harmful drugs. Sudden death may result from cardiac arrhythmia.

Laboratory Findings

Levels of ALA and PBG are substantially increased during acute
attacks. These levels may decrease after an attack but usually remain
increased unless the disease becomes asymptomatic for a prolonged
period.
Porphyrins are also markedly increased, which accounts for reddish urine in AIP. These are predominantly uroporphyrins, which can
form nonenzymatically from PBG. The increased urinary porphyrins
in AIP are predominantly isomer III; however, their formation is
likely to be largely enzymatic, which might occur if excess ALA produced in the liver enters cells in other tissues and is then converted to
porphyrins by the heme biosynthetic pathway. Porphobilin, a degradation product of PBG, and dipyrrolomethanes appear to account for
brownish urinary discoloration. Total fecal porphyrins and plasma
porphyrins are normal or slightly increased in AIP. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin may be somewhat increased in patients with manifest
AIP.
Erythrocyte HMBS activity is approximately half-­normal in most
patients with AIP. The normal range is wide and overlaps with the
range for AIP heterozygotes. Some HMBS pathogenic variants cause
the enzyme to be deficient only in nonerythroid tissues. HMBS activity
is also highly dependent on erythrocyte age, and an increase in erythropoiesis from concurrent illness in an AIP patient may raise the activity into the normal range. Thus measurement of erythrocyte HMBS
activity alone is insufficient in testing for AIP.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

An increased urinary PBG level establishes that a patient has one of
the three most common acute porphyrias (see Table 112.2). Measuring PBG in serum is preferred when there is coexistent severe
renal disease but is less sensitive when renal function is normal.
Measurement of urinary ALA is less sensitive than PBG and also
less specific, but will detect ADP, the fourth type of acute porphyria. Measurement of urinary porphyrins is also useful, because
they may remain elevated after ALA and PBG return to normal
and are also elevated in ADP. Decreased erythrocyte PBGD activity helps confirm the diagnosis of AIP, but is not found in all AIP
patients.
Knowledge of the HMBS pathogenic variant in a family enables reliable identification of other pathogenic variant carriers. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling
(CVS) in a fetus with a known HMBS pathogenic variant in the family.
Prenatal diagnosis is typically not performed because of the low penetrance of the disorder and favorable prognosis with treatment.

Complications

AIP and other acute porphyrias are typically associated with mild
abnormalities in liver function tests; some patients develop chronic
liver disease. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is also increased,
perhaps 60-­to 70-­fold after age 50, even in asymptomatic individuals. Few patients who developed this neoplasm had increases in serum
α-­fetoprotein. Patients with acute porphyrias, especially >50 years old,
should be screened by ultrasound or an alternative imaging method at
6-­month intervals.

May require treatment during acute attacks, and sometimes becomes chronic.

From Anderson KE, Bloomer JR, Bonkovsky HL, et al. Desnick recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute porphyrias, Ann Intern Med. 2005;142(6):439–450.

The risk of chronic hypertension and impaired renal function is
increased in these patients, most often with evidence of interstitial
nephritis. A nephrotoxic effect of ALA may contribute. This may progress to severe renal failure and require renal transplantation.
Patients with recurrent attacks may develop chronic neuropathic
pain, although this has not been well characterized. Referral to a neurologist is recommended for any patient with ongoing or residual neurologic symptoms. In addition, depression and anxiety are common in
these patients.

Treatment
Hemin

Intravenous (IV) hemin is the treatment of choice for most acute
attacks of porphyria. There is a favorable biochemical and clinical response to early treatment with hemin, but less rapid clinical
improvement if treatment is delayed. It is no longer recommended
that therapy with hemin for a severe attack be started only after
an unsuccessful trial of IV glucose for several days. Mild attacks
without severe manifestations, such as paresis, seizures, hyponatremia, or pain requiring opioids, may be treated with IV glucose.
After IV administration, hemin binds to hemopexin and albumin in
plasma and is taken up primarily in hepatocytes, where it augments
the regulatory heme pool in hepatocytes, represses the synthesis
of hepatic ALAS1, and dramatically reduces porphyrin precursor
overproduction.
Hemin* is available for IV administration in the United States as
lyophilized hematin (Panhematin, Recordati). Degradation products
begin to form as soon as the lyophilized product is reconstituted with
sterile water, and these can cause infusion site phlebitis and a transient
anticoagulant effect. Repeated treatment can lead to loss of venous
access and iron overload. Reconstitution with 30% human albumin can
enhance stability and prevent these adverse effects and is recommended
* Hemin is the generic name for all heme preparations used for IV administration. Hemin is
also a chemical term that refers to the oxidized (ferric) form of heme (iron protoporphyrin
IX) and is usually isolated as hemin chloride. In alkaline solution, the chloride is replaced
by the hydroxyl ion, forming hydroxyheme, or hematin.

especially if a peripheral vein is used for the infusion. Uncommon side
effects of hemin include fever, aching, malaise, hemolysis, anaphylaxis,
and circulatory collapse. Heme arginate, a more stable hemin preparation, is available in Europe and South Africa.
Hemin treatment should be instituted only after a diagnosis of
acute porphyria has been initially confirmed by a marked increase
in urinary PBG. When prior documentation of the diagnosis is
available for review, it is not essential to confirm an increase in PBG
with every recurrent attack if other causes of the symptoms are
excluded clinically. The standard regimen of hemin for treatment
of acute porphyric attacks is 3-­4 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Lower doses
have less effect on porphyrin precursor excretion and probably less
clinical benefit.
Givosiran, an ALAS1-­directed interfering RNA therapeutic, is effective for preventing frequent attacks in adults with acute hepatic porphyrias. Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid lowering of ALA and
PBG, resulting in a reduction in attacks, chronic symptoms, and hemin
utilization.

General and Supportive Measures

Drugs that may exacerbate porphyrias (see Table 112.3) should be discontinued whenever possible, and other precipitating factors identified.
Hospitalization is warranted, except for mild attacks; for treatment of
severe pain, nausea, and vomiting; for administration of hemin and
fluids; and for monitoring vital capacity, nutritional status, neurologic
function, and electrolytes. Pain usually requires an opioid; there is low
risk for addiction after recovery from the acute attack. Ondansetron
or promethazine is needed for nausea and vomiting and short-­acting
benzodiazepines for anxiety and restlessness. β-­Adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to control tachycardia and hypertension but
may be hazardous in patients with hypovolemia and incipient cardiac
failure.

Carbohydrate Loading

The effects of carbohydrates on repressing hepatic ALAS1 and reducing porphyrin precursor excretion are weak compared with those
of hemin. Therefore carbohydrate loading is recommended only for

970 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
mild attacks (e.g., without severe nausea or vomiting, hyponatremia,
seizures, paresis, or pain requiring opioids). Glucose polymer solutions by mouth are sometimes tolerated. At least 300 g of IV glucose,
usually given as a 10% solution, has been recommended for adults
hospitalized with attacks of porphyria. Amounts up to 500 g daily
may be more effective, but large volumes may favor the development
of hyponatremia.

Other Therapies

Liver transplantation is effective in patients with severe AIP who are
refractory to pharmacologic therapy. Patients can generally expect a
complete biochemical and symptomatic resolution after transplantation. However, liver transplantation is a high-­risk procedure and
should be considered only as a last resort.

Seizures and Other Complications

Patients who experience seizures during an acute attack, especially
if caused by hyponatremia or other electrolyte imbalances, may not
require prolonged treatment with anticonvulsant drugs, most of which
have at least some potential for exacerbating acute porphyrias. Gabapentin, pregabalin, levetiracetam, and vigabatrin are considered safe
or probably safe, and clonazepam is probably less harmful than phenytoin, barbiturates, or valproic acid.
Control of hypertension is important and may help prevent
chronic renal impairment, which can progress and require renal
transplantation.

Safe and Unsafe Drugs

Patients often do well with avoidance of harmful drugs. Listings are
available from the European Porphyria Network (www.porphyria-­
europe.com) and American Porphyria Foundation (https://porphyr
iafoundation.org/drugdatabase/), but some listings are controversial.
Information regarding safety is lacking for many drugs, especially for
those recently introduced.
Exogenous progestins can induce attacks of porphyria. Estrogens are
seldom reported to be harmful when given alone. Synthetic steroids
with an ethynyl substituent can cause a mechanism-­based destruction
of hepatic CYPs and should probably be avoided in patients with acute
porphyria. Danazol is especially contraindicated.

Other Situations

Major surgery can be carried out safely in patients with acute porphyria, especially if barbiturates are avoided. Halothane has been recommended as an inhalation agent and propofol and midazolam as IV
induction agents.
Pregnancy is usually well tolerated, which is surprising, because
levels of progesterone, a potent inducer of hepatic ALAS1, are considerably increased during pregnancy. Some females do experience continuing attacks during pregnancy. This has sometimes been attributed
to reduced caloric intake or metoclopramide, a drug sometimes used to
treat hyperemesis gravidarum and considered by some to be harmful
in acute porphyrias.
Diabetes mellitus and other endocrine conditions are not known
to precipitate attacks of porphyria. In fact, the onset of diabetes
mellitus and resulting high circulating glucose levels may decrease
the frequency of attacks and lower porphyrin precursor levels in
AIP.

Prognosis

In Finland, 74% of patients with AIP or VP reported that they led
normal lives, and <30% had recurrent attacks during several years of
follow-­up. In those presenting with acute symptoms, recurrent attacks
were most likely within the next 1-­3 years. Moreover, only 6% of gene
carriers who had never had attacks developed symptoms. The positive
outlook may result from earlier detection, better treatment of acute
attacks, and replacement of harmful drugs such as barbiturates and
sulfonamides with safer drugs. However, some patients continue to
have recurrent attacks, chronic pain, and other symptoms, even after
avoiding known exacerbating factors.

Prevention

For prevention of attacks, it is important to identify multiple inciting
factors and remove as many as possible. Drugs for concurrent medical
conditions should be reviewed. Because dietary factors are often unapparent, consultation with a dietitian may be useful. A well-­balanced
diet that is somewhat high in carbohydrate (60–70% of total calories)
and sufficient to maintain weight is recommended. There is little evidence that additional dietary carbohydrate helps further in preventing attacks, and it may lead to weight gain. Patients who wish to lose
excess weight should do so gradually and when they are clinically
stable. Rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery may exacerbate acute
porphyrias. Iron deficiency, which can be detected by a low serum ferritin level, should be corrected.
Gonadotropin-­releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, which reversibly suppress ovulation, can be dramatically effective for preventing
frequently recurring luteal-­phase attacks, but baseline and continuing
gynecologic evaluation and bone mineral density measurements are
important; transdermal estrogen or a bisphosphonate may be added
to prevent bone loss. Hemin administered once or twice weekly can
prevent frequent attacks of porphyria in some patients. Alternatively,
single-­dose hemin can be administered “on demand” at an outpatient
infusion center to abort an attack and prevent hospitalization, if a
patient can recognize early “prodromal” symptoms.
Givosiran (Givlaari, Alnylam) an interfering RNA therapeutic that
is administered subcutaneously every month, has been approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) for prevention of acute attacks of an AHP.

Genetic Counseling

A pathogenic variant identified in the index case can be sought in
offspring at any age. Counseling should emphasize that the great
majority of those who inherit an HMBS pathogenic variant never
develop symptoms, and the prognosis of those who do is favorable.
Therefore a normal, healthy life is expected, especially with avoidance of harmful drugs and other factors and prompt recognition and
treatment of symptoms should they occur. Given this favorable outlook, even during pregnancy, having children is not precluded for
those who have inherited a pathogenic variant, and prenatal diagnosis of acute porphyrias is less important than it is for many other
inherited diseases.

CONGENITAL ERYTHROPOIETIC PORPHYRIA

Also termed Günther disease, this rare disease usually presents with
photosensitivity shortly after birth or in utero as nonimmune hydrops.

Etiology

CEP is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a marked deficiency of
uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). Many UROS pathogenic variants have been identified among CEP families. Later-­onset disease in
adults is often less severe and likely to be associated with myeloproliferative disorders and expansion of a clone of erythroblasts that carry a
UROS pathogenic variant.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

UROS, which is extremely deficient in CEP, catalyzes inversion of pyrrole ring D of HMB and rapid cyclization of the linear tetrapyrrole to
form uroporphyrinogen III. This enzyme is also termed uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. The human enzyme is a monomer. The gene for
the enzyme is found on chromosome 10q25.3→q26.3 and contains 10
exons. Erythroid and housekeeping transcripts are generated by alternative promoters but encode the same enzyme.
In CEP, HMB accumulates in erythroid cells during hemoglobin
synthesis and cyclizes nonenzymatically to form uroporphyrinogen
I, which is auto-­oxidized to uroporphyrin I. Some of the uroporphyrinogen I that accumulates is metabolized to coproporphyrinogen I,
which accumulates because it is not a substrate for coproporphyrinogen oxidase. Thus both uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I accumulate in the bone marrow and are then found in circulating erythrocytes,
plasma, urine, and feces.

Chapter 112 u The Porphyrias 971
A variety of UROS pathogenic variants have been identified in CEP,
including missense and nonsense pathogenic variants, large and small
deletions and insertions, splicing defects, and intronic branch-­point
pathogenic variants. At least four pathogenic variants have been identified in the erythroid-­specific promoter. Many patients inherited a
different pathogenic variant from each parent, and most pathogenic
variants have been detected in only one or a few families. An exception is a common pathogenic variant, C73R, which is at a pathogenic
variant hot spot and was found in approximately 33% of alleles. One
child with CEP had a GATA1 pathogenic variant, with no UROS
pathogenic variant. The CEP phenotype may be modulated by gain-­
of-­function ALAS2 pathogenic variants, which were first identified as
causing XLP.
Genotype-­phenotype correlations have been based on the in vitro
expression of various CEP pathogenic variants and the severity of associated phenotypic manifestations. The C73R allele, which is associated
with a severe phenotype in homozygotes or in patients heteroallelic for
C73R and another pathogenic variant expressing little residual activity, resulted in <1% of normal enzyme activity. Patients with the C73R
allele and heteroallelic for other pathogenic variants expressing more
residual activity have milder disease.
Hemolysis is a common feature of CEP. Excess porphyrins in circulating erythrocytes cause cell damage, perhaps by a phototoxic mechanism, leading to both intravascular hemolysis and increased splenic
clearance of erythrocytes. Also important is ineffective erythropoiesis,
with intramedullary destruction of porphyrin-­laden erythroid cells
and breakdown of heme. Expansion of the bone marrow as a result
of erythroid hyperplasia may contribute, along with vitamin D deficiency, to bone loss. Nutrient deficiencies sometimes cause erythroid
hypoplasia. Despite the marked deficiency of UROS, heme production
in the bone marrow is increased because of hemolysis and a compensatory increase in hemoglobin production. This occurs, however, at the
expense of marked accumulation of HMB, which is converted to porphyrinogens and porphyrins.

Clinical Manifestations

In severe cases, CEP can cause fetal loss or may be recognized in utero
as causing intrauterine hemolytic anemia and nonimmune hydrops
fetalis. CEP may be associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and
phototherapy may unintentionally induce severe cutaneous photosensitivity and scarring.
The most characteristic presentation is reddish urine or pink
staining of diapers by urine or meconium shortly after birth (Fig.
112.2). With sun exposure, severe blistering lesions appear on
exposed areas of skin on the face and hands and have been termed
hydroa estivale because they are more severe with greater sunlight
exposure during summer (Fig. 112.3). Vesicles and bullae, as well as
friability, hypertrichosis, scarring, thickening, and areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, are very similar to those seen in
PCT but usually much more severe. Infection and scarring sometimes cause loss of facial features and fingers and damage to the cornea, ears, and nails. Porphyrins are deposited in dentin and bone in
utero. Reddish-­brown teeth in normal light, an appearance termed
erythrodontia, display reddish fluorescence under long-­wave UV
light (Fig. 112.4). Unaffected children born to a mother with CEP
may have erythrodontia. Hemolysis and splenomegaly are common
in CEP. Bone marrow compensation may be adequate, especially in
milder cases. Patients with severe phenotypes, however, are often
transfusion dependent. Splenomegaly may contribute to the anemia
and cause leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which may be complicated by significant bleeding. Neuropathic symptoms are absent, and
there is no sensitivity to drugs, hormones, or carbohydrate restriction. The liver may be damaged by iron overload, viral hepatitis, or
other causes.
Milder cases of CEP with onset of symptoms in adult life and without erythrodontia may be misdiagnosed initially as PCT. Late-­onset
cases are likely to be associated with myeloproliferative disorders and
expansion of a clone of erythroid cells carrying a UROS pathogenic
variant.

Laboratory Findings

Urinary porphyrin excretion and circulating porphyrin levels in CEP
are much higher than in almost all other porphyrias. Urinary porphyrin excretion can be as high as 50-­100 mg daily and consists mostly of
uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I. ALA and PBG are normal. Fecal
porphyrins are greatly increased, with a predominance of coproporphyrin I.

972 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
Marked increases in erythrocyte porphyrins in CEP also consist
mostly of uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I. These porphyrins are
also increased in bone marrow, spleen, plasma, and to a lesser extent,
liver. The porphyrin pattern in erythrocytes is influenced by rates of
erythropoiesis and erythroid maturation. A predominance of protoporphyrin has been noted in some CEP patients, and in one such
patient, uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin increased when erythropoiesis was stimulated by blood removal.

Treatment

Advising patients to avoid sunlight exposure is essential, because sunlight exposure does not cause immediate severe pain in CEP, in contrast to the protoporphyrias. Minimizing skin trauma and prompt
treatment of any cutaneous infections are also essential. Sunscreen
lotions and beta-­carotene are of little benefit. Transfusions to achieve
a level of hemoglobin sufficient to significantly suppress erythropoiesis
can be quite effective in reducing porphyrin levels and photosensitivity. Concurrent deferoxamine to reduce iron overload and hydroxyurea to suppress erythropoiesis further may provide additional benefit.
Splenectomy reduces hemolysis and transfusion requirements in some
patients. Iron restriction by phlebotomy or iron chelators may improve
photosensitivity in CEP patients by decreasing ALAS2 activity and
porphyrin production.
The most effective treatment is marrow stem cell transplantation in
early childhood, which has greatly reduced porphyrin levels and photosensitivity and increased long-­term survival.

Prognosis

The outlook is favorable in milder cases and in patients with more
severe disease, especially after successful bone marrow or stem cell
transplantation. Otherwise, prognosis relates to adherence to sunlight
avoidance.

Prevention and Genetic Counseling

Genetic counseling is important for affected families because CEP can
be recognized before birth, and a severe phenotype can often be predicted by identifying the nature of the UROS pathogenic variants.

PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA

Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common and readily treated
human porphyria (see Table 112.2). It occurs in mid or late adult
life and is rare in children. Previous terms include symptomatic porphyria, PCT symptomatica, and idiosyncratic porphyria. The underlying cause is a liver-­specific acquired deficiency of uroporphyrinogen
decarboxylase (UROD) with contributions by genetic and acquired

Uroporphyrin

Specific inhibitor

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of CEP should be documented by full characterization
of porphyrin patterns and identification of the underlying pathogenic
variants. In later-­onset cases, an underlying myeloproliferative disorder and a UROS somatic pathogenic variant should be suspected and
studied in detail.
The clinical picture in hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) may
be similar, but the porphyrin patterns in urine and feces in HEP resemble PCT. A predominant increase in erythrocyte protoporphyrin is not
expected in CEP, except in mild cases, but is characteristic of HEP and
rare homozygous cases of AIP, HCP, and VP. EPP and XLP are also distinguished by normal urinary porphyrins and by increases in erythrocyte metal-­free protoporphyrin, whereas the increased protoporphyrin
in other conditions is mostly complexed with zinc.
CEP should be suspected as a cause of nonimmune hydrops or
hemolytic anemia in utero. With recognition of the disease at this
stage, intrauterine transfusion can be considered, and phototherapy
for hyperbilirubinemia after birth, which can cause severe blistering
and scarring, can be avoided. Prenatal diagnosis is feasible by finding
red-­brown discoloration and increased porphyrins in amniotic fluid
and measuring porphyrins in fetal erythrocytes and plasma. UROS
pathogenic variants can be identified in chorionic villi or cultured
amniotic cells.

susceptibility factors, including heterozygous UROD pathogenic variants in familial PCT. HEP, the homozygous form of familial PCT,
usually has a more severe presentation in childhood, resembling CEP
clinically.

Etiology

PCT is caused by a reduction of hepatic UROD activity to ≤20% of
normal activity. An inhibitor of hepatic UROD has been characterized as a uroporphomethene, which is derived from partial oxidation
of the enzyme substrate uroporphyrinogen. CYPs, such as CYP1A2,
as well as iron, are involved in its formation (Fig. 112.5). Although
enzyme activity is inhibited, the amount of hepatic enzyme protein
measured immunochemically remains at its genetically determined
level.
UROD catalyzes the decarboxylation of the four acetic acid side
chains of uroporphyrinogen (an octacarboxyl porphyrinogen) to form
coproporphyrinogen (a tetracarboxyl porphyrinogen). The enzyme
reaction occurs in a sequential, clockwise fashion, with the intermediate formation of hepta-­, hexa-­, and pentacarboxyl porphyrinogens.
Uroporphyrinogen III, as compared with other uroporphyrinogen isomers, is the preferred substrate. Human UROD is a dimer with the two
active site clefts juxtaposed. The UROD gene contains 10 exons, with
only one promoter. Therefore the gene is transcribed as a single mRNA
in all tissues.
The majority of PCT patients (80%) have no UROD pathogenic variants and have sporadic (type 1) disease. Some are heterozygous for
UROD pathogenic variants and have familial (type 2) PCT. Described
pathogenic variants include missense, nonsense, and splice-­site pathogenic variants; several small and large deletions; and small insertions,
with only a few identified in more than one family. A few of these
pathogenic variants may be located near the active site cleft, but most
appear to involve regions with important structural roles. Being heterozygous for a UROD pathogenic variant is insufficient to cause PCT.
Individuals with type 2 PCT are born with 50% of normal UROD activity, and later in life other susceptibility factors (as in type 1) lead to
production of the uroporphomethene inhibitor and further reduction
on hepatic UROD activity to <20% of normal. Because penetrance of
the genetic trait is low, many patients with familial PCT have no family
history of the disease.
Induction of hepatic ALAS1 is not a prominent feature in PCT,
although alcohol may increase this enzyme slightly. Iron and estrogens
are not potent inducers of ALAS1, and drugs that are potent inducers
of ALAS1 and CYPs are much less frequently implicated in PCT than
in acute porphyrias.
Blistering skin lesions result from porphyrins that circulate from the
liver. Sunlight exposure leads to generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in the skin, complement activation, and lysosomal damage.

Chapter 112 u The Porphyrias 973
Epidemiology

Differences in prevalence probably relate to geographic variations in
susceptibility factors such as hepatitis C and ethanol use. The yearly
incidence in the United Kingdom was estimated at 2-­5 in 1 million in
the general population, and the prevalence in the United States and
Czechoslovakia was estimated at 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 5,000 in the general population, respectively. The disease was reported to be prevalent
in the Bantus of South Africa in association with iron overload. PCT is
more common in males, possibly because of greater alcohol intake, and
in women it is usually associated with estrogen use.
A massive outbreak of PCT occurred in eastern Turkey in the 1950s.
Wheat intended for planting and treated with hexachlorobenzene as a
fungicide was consumed by many during a food shortage. Cases and
small outbreaks of PCT after exposure to other chemicals, including
di-­and trichlorophenols and 2,3,7,8-­
tetrachlorodibenzo-­
p-­dioxin
(TCDD, dioxin), have been reported. The manifestations improved in
most cases when the exposure was stopped. There are reported cases of
delayed onset many years after chemical exposure.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

Generation of a UROD inhibitor in the liver plays an important role
in all three types of PCT. Eighty percent of patients with type 1 (sporadic) PCT have no UROD pathogenic variants, and UROD activity is
normal in nonhepatic tissues such as erythrocytes. In type 2 (familial) PCT, a heterozygous UROD pathogenic variant results in a partial
(approximately 50%) deficiency of UROD in all tissues from birth, and
the disease becomes active in some heterozygotes after further reduction of hepatic UROD activity to ≤20% of normal. Type 3 is rare and
describes PCT without a UROD pathogenic variant occurring in more
than one family member. Another genetic basis, such as HFE pathogenic variants, may be identified. HEP results from inheritance of a
UROD pathogenic variant from each parent and typically causes severe
photosensitivity resembling CEP starting in early childhood. Some
developed symptoms in childhood more typical of PCT.
CYPs, especially CYP1A2, can catalyze the oxidation of uroporphyrinogen to uroporphyrin. This uroporphyrinogen oxidase activity
is enhanced by iron and leads to formation of a UROD inhibitor (see
Fig. 112.5). CYP1a2 seems essential for development of uroporphyria
in rodents, because experimental uroporphyria does not develop in
CYP1a2 knockout mice.

Susceptibility Factors

The following factors are implicated in the development of PCT, and
these occur in various combinations in individual patients.

Iron

PCT is an iron-­related disorder, and a normal or increased amount of
iron in the liver is essential for its development. Moreover, treatment
by phlebotomy to reduce hepatic iron leads to remission. Serum ferritin levels are usually in the upper part of the normal range or moderately increased, and liver histology commonly shows increased iron
staining. Prevalence of the C282Y pathogenic variant of the HFE gene,
which is the major cause of hemochromatosis in people of Northern
European ancestry, is increased in both type 1 and type 2 PCT, and
approximately 10% of patients are C282Y homozygotes. In Southern
Europe the H63D pathogenic variant is more prevalent. PCT may
develop in patients with secondary iron overload. Reduced hepatic
expression of the hormone hepcidin occurs in hemochromatosis and
also in PCT, regardless of HFE genotype, which may explain hepatic
siderosis in this condition.

Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent in PCT in most
geographic locations; in the United States, for example, HCV is present
in 56–74% of cases, which is similar to rates in Southern Europe. Prevalence of hepatitis C in PCT is lower in Northern Europe (<20%). Steatosis and oxidative stress in HCV infection may favor iron-­mediated
generation of ROS and a UROD inhibitor. Dysregulation of hepcidin
occurs in hepatitis C and may lead to increased iron absorption.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Many reports suggest that HIV infection can contribute to the development of PCT, although less frequently than HCV.

Ethanol

The long-­recognized association between alcohol and PCT may be
explained by the generation of ROS, which may cause oxidative damage, mitochondrial injury, depletion of reduced glutathione and other
antioxidant defenses, increased production of endotoxin, and activation of Kupffer cells. Also, alcohol may contribute to iron overload by
impairing hepcidin production.

Smoking and Cytochrome P450 Enzymes

Although not extensively studied as a susceptibility factor, smoking is
often associated with alcohol use in PCT. It may act to induce hepatic
CYPs and oxidative stress. Hepatic CYPs are thought to be important
in oxidizing uroporphyrinogen and generating a UROD inhibitor (see
Fig. 112.5). Genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A2 and CYP1A1 have
been implicated in human PCT. The frequency of an inducible CYP1A2
genotype was more common in PCT patients than in controls in several studies.

Antioxidant Status

Ascorbic acid deficiency contributes to uroporphyria in laboratory
models and perhaps in human PCT. In one series, plasma ascorbate
levels were substantially reduced in 84% of patients with PCT. Low levels of serum carotenoids were also described, further suggesting that
oxidant stress in hepatocytes is important in PCT.

Estrogens

Use of estrogen-­containing oral contraceptives (OCs) or postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy is frequently associated with PCT
(type 1 or 2) in women. PCT sometimes occurs during pregnancy,
although it is not clear whether the risk is increased.

Cancer Chemotherapy

Cancer chemotherapeutic agents are commonly associated with rare
childhood cases of PCT, although specific agents have not been implicated. Susceptibility factors found in adults are rare in children with
PCT.

Clinical Manifestations
Cutaneous Manifestations

PCT is readily recognized by blistering and crusted skin lesions on
the backs of the hands, which are the most sun-­exposed areas of the
body, and less often on the forearms, face, ears, neck, legs, and feet (Fig.
112.6). The fluid-­filled vesicles usually rupture and become crusted or
denuded areas, heal slowly, and are subject to infection. The skin is friable, and minor trauma may cause blisters or denudation of skin. Small
white plaques, termed milia, may precede or follow vesicle formation.
Facial hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation are also common. Severe
scarring and thickening of sun-­exposed skin may resemble scleroderma. Skin biopsy findings include subepidermal blistering and deposition of periodic acid–Schiff-­(PAS)–positive material around blood
vessels and fine fibrillar material at the dermoepithelial junction, which
may be related to excessive skin fragility. IgG, other immunoglobulins,
and complement are also deposited at the dermoepithelial junction and
around dermal blood vessels. The skin lesions and histologic changes
are not specific for PCT. The same findings occur in VP and HCP and
resemble those of CEP and HEP but are usually less severe. PCT usually develops in mid or late adult life. Earlier onset may be seen in those
with UROD or HFE pathogenic variants and childhood onset with cancer chemotherapy and UROD pathogenic variants.

Liver Abnormalities

PCT is almost always associated with nonspecific liver abnormalities, especially increased serum transaminases and γ-­
glutamyltranspeptidase, even in the absence of heavy alcohol intake or
hepatitis C. Most histologic findings, such as necrosis, inflammation,

974 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
to a greater extent than fecal porphyrins. However, the total amount
of porphyrins excreted in feces in PCT exceeds that in urine, and total
excretion of type III isomers (including isocoproporphyrins, which are
mostly derived from the type III series) exceeds that of type I isomers.
Perhaps because uroporphyrinogen III is the preferred substrate for
UROD, more uroporphyrinogen I than III accumulates and is excreted
as uroporphyrin I in PCT. Hepta-­and hexacarboxyl porphyrin are
mostly isomer III, and pentacarboxyl porphyrin and coproporphyrin
are approximately equal mixtures of isomers I and III.

increased iron, and increased fat, are nonspecific. Specific findings
include red fluorescence of liver tissue and fluorescent, birefringent,
needle-­like inclusions presumably consisting of porphyrins. Electron
microscopy shows these inclusions are in lysosomes, and paracrystalline inclusions are found in mitochondria. Distorted lobular architecture and cirrhosis are more common with long-­standing disease.
The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is increased, with
reported incidences ranging from 4% to 47% in PCT. These tumors
seldom contain large amounts of porphyrins.

Other Features and Associations

Mild or moderate erythrocytosis in some adult patients is not well
understood, but chronic lung disease from smoking may contribute.
An earlier onset of symptoms may be noted in patients with genetic
predisposing factors, such as an inherited partial deficiency of UROD
or the C282Y/C282Y HFE genotype. Iron overload secondary to conditions such as myelofibrosis and end-­stage renal disease (ESRD) may
be associated with PCT. The disease can be especially severe in patients
with ESRD because the lack of urinary excretion leads to much higher
concentrations of porphyrins in plasma, and the excess porphyrins are
poorly dialyzable. PCT occurs more frequently in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other immunologic disorders than
would be expected by chance.

Laboratory Findings

Porphyrins accumulate in the liver mostly as the oxidized porphyrins
rather than porphyrinogens in PCT, as indicated by the immediate
red fluorescence observed in liver tissue. This develops over weeks or
months before porphyrins appear in plasma and are transported to the
skin, causing photosensitivity. In contrast to the acute hepatic porphyrias, only a very small increase in synthesis of heme pathway intermediates and little or no increase in hepatic ALAS1 are required to account
for the excess porphyrins excreted in PCT.
Hepatic UROD deficiency leads to a complex pattern of excess
porphyrins, which initially accumulate as porphyrinogens and then
undergo nonenzymatic oxidation to the corresponding porphyrins
(uro-­, hepta-­, hexa-­, and pentacarboxyl porphyrins, and isocoproporphyrins). Uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin predominate in
urine, with lesser amounts of coproporphyrin and penta-­and hexacarboxyl porphyrin. A normally minor pathway is accentuated by UROD
deficiency, whereby pentacarboxyl porphyrinogen is oxidized by coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX; the next enzyme in the pathway),
forming isocoproporphyrinogen, an atypical tetracarboxyl porphyrinogen. Relative to normal values, urinary porphyrins are increased

Plasma and urine porphyrins are always increased in clinically manifest PCT, and their measurement is useful for screening. A normal
value rules out PCT and other porphyrias that produce blistering skin
lesions. It is useful to determine the plasma fluorescence emission
maximum at neutral pH, because a maximum near 619 nm is characteristic of PCT (as with CEP and HCP) and, importantly, excludes
VP, which has a distinctly different fluorescence maximum. Increased
urinary or plasma porphyrins, with a predominance of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin, is characteristic, although not
absolutely specific, for PCT and may occasionally be seen in other
porphyrias. Nonspecific increases in urine porphyrins, especially of
coproporphyrin, occur in liver disease and other medical conditions.
Urinary ALA may be increased slightly in PCT, and PBG is normal.
Mild cases of CEP can mimic PCT clinically, and this possibility is
ruled out by finding normal or only mildly increased levels of erythrocyte porphyrins.
Familial (type 2) can be distinguished from sporadic (type 1) PCT
by finding decreased erythrocyte UROD activity (in type 2) or, more
reliably, by finding a disease-­related UROD pathogenic variant. Type 3
is distinguished from type 1 only by occurrence of PCT in a relative.
Biochemical findings in HEP are similar to those in PCT, but with an
additional marked increase in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin.
Pseudoporphyria (also known as pseudo-­PCT) presents with skin
lesions that closely resemble PCT, but without significant increases in
plasma or urine porphyrins. A photosensitizing agent such as a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is sometimes implicated. Both
PCT and pseudoporphyria may occur in patients with ESRD.

Complications

Cutaneous blisters may rupture and become infected, sometimes leading to cellulitis. In more severe disease in patients with ESRD, repeated
infections can be mutilating, as in CEP. Pseudoscleroderma, with
scarring, contraction, and calcification of skin and subcutaneous tissue, is a rare complication. Other complications include advanced liver
disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Treatment

Two specific and effective forms of treatment, phlebotomy and low-­
dose hydroxychloroquine, are available. Susceptibility factors should
be removed when possible. The diagnosis of PCT must be firmly
established because conditions, including other porphyrias, that produce identical cutaneous lesions do not respond to these treatments.
Treatment can usually be started after demonstrating an increase in
plasma total porphyrins and excluding VP by analysis of the fluorescence spectrum at neutral pH, while urine and fecal studies are
still pending. Use of alcohol, estrogens (in women), and smoking
should be stopped, and patients tested for HCV, HIV, and HFE pathogenic variants. Susceptibility factors and degree of iron overload, as
assessed by the serum ferritin concentration, can influence the choice
of treatment.
Phlebotomy is considered standard therapy and is effective in both
children and adults with PCT because it reduces hepatic iron content.
Treatment is guided by plasma (or serum) ferritin and porphyrin levels. Hemoglobin or hematocrit levels should be followed to prevent
symptomatic anemia. For adults, a unit of blood (450 mL) is removed
at about 2-­week intervals until a target serum ferritin near the lower
limit of normal (15 ng/mL) is achieved. A total of six to eight phlebotomies is often sufficient in adults. After this, plasma porphyrin

Chapter 112 u The Porphyrias 975
concentrations continue to fall from pretreatment levels (generally 10-­
25 μg/dL) to below the upper limit of normal (1 μg/dL), usually after
several more weeks. This is followed by gradual clearing of skin lesions,
sometimes including pseudoscleroderma. Liver function abnormalities may improve, and hepatic siderosis, needle-­like inclusions, and
red fluorescence of liver tissue will disappear. Although remission usually persists even if ferritin levels later return to normal, it is advisable
to follow porphyrin levels and reinstitute phlebotomies if porphyrins
begin to increase. Infusions of deferoxamine, an iron chelator, may be
used when phlebotomy is contraindicated.
An alternative when phlebotomy is contraindicated or poorly
tolerated is a low-­dose regimen of hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine). Normal doses of these 4-­aminoquinoline antimalarials in
PCT increase plasma and urinary porphyrin levels and increase photosensitivity, reflecting an outpouring of porphyrins from the liver.
This is accompanied by acute hepatocellular damage, with fever, malaise, nausea, and increased serum transaminases, but is followed by
complete remission of the porphyria. These adverse consequences of
normal doses are largely avoided by a low-­dose regimen (for adults,
hydroxychloroquine 100 mg or chloroquine 125 mg, i.e., half a normal tablet, twice weekly), which can be continued until plasma or
urine porphyrins are normalized. In young children, half the adult
dose is recommended. There is at least some risk of retinopathy, which
may be lower with hydroxychloroquine. The mechanism of action of
4-­aminoquinolines in PCT is not known but is quite specific, because
these drugs are not useful in other porphyrias. Recent studies indicate
that low-­dose hydroxychloroquine is as safe and effective as phlebotomy in adults with PCT.
Experience to date supports treatment of patients with PCT and
hepatitis C with direct-­acting antiviral agents to achieve cure of this
viral infection within a few months as well as remission of PCT and
avoiding treatment by phlebotomy or low-­dose hydroxychloroquine.
PCT in patients with ESRD is often more severe and difficult to treat.
However, erythropoietin administration can correct anemia, mobilize
iron, and support phlebotomy in many cases. Improvement is expected
after renal transplantation, related in part to resumption of endogenous
erythropoietic production.
Liver imaging and a serum α-­fetoprotein determination may be
advisable in all PCT patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis at
6-­month intervals for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Finding low-­erythrocyte UROD activity or a UROD pathogenic variant
identifies those with an underlying genetic predisposition, which does
not alter treatment but is useful for genetic counseling.

Prognosis

Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most readily treated form of porphyria,
and complete remission is expected with treatment by phlebotomy or
low-­dose hydroxychloroquine or by treatment of hepatitis C. There is
little information on rates of recurrence and long-­term outlook. Risk
for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is increased, and some susceptibility factors such as alcohol, hepatitis C, and iron overload can
contribute to such risks.

Prevention and Genetic Counseling

A heritable UROD pathogenic variant can usually be detected or
excluded by measuring erythrocyte UROD activity, although DNA
studies are more sensitive. Relatives of patients with UROD pathogenic variants have an increased risk for developing PCT and may have
increased motivation to avoid adverse behaviors such as ethanol and
tobacco use and exposures to HCV and HIV (although such counseling would be given to anyone). The finding of HFE pathogenic variants,
and especially C282Y, should prompt screening of relatives, some of
whom may be C282Y homozygotes and warrant lifelong monitoring
of serum ferritin.

HEPATOERYTHROPOIETIC PORPHYRIA

HEP is the homozygous form of familial (type 2) PCT; it resembles
CEP clinically. Excess porphyrins originate mostly from liver, with a
pattern consistent with severe UROD deficiency.

Etiology

HEP is an autosomal recessive disorder, and most patients have inherited different pathogenic variants from unrelated parents. In contrast
to most pathogenic variants in familial PCT, most causing HEP are
associated with expression of some residual enzyme activity. At least
one genotype is associated with the predominant excretion of pentacarboxyl porphyrin.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

Excess porphyrins originate primarily from the liver in HEP, although
the substantial increase in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin indicates
that the heme biosynthetic pathway is also impaired in bone marrow
erythroid cells. Apparently, porphyrinogens accumulate in the marrow while hemoglobin synthesis is most active and are metabolized to
protoporphyrin after hemoglobin synthesis is complete. The cutaneous
lesions are a result of photoactivation of porphyrins in skin, as in other
cutaneous porphyrias.

Clinical Manifestations

This disease usually presents with blistering skin lesions, hypertrichosis, scarring, and red urine in infancy or childhood. Sclerodermoid
skin changes are sometimes prominent. Unusually mild cases have
been described. Concurrent conditions that affect liver function can
alter disease severity; the disease manifested because of hepatitis A in
a 2-­year-­old child and then improved with recovery of liver function.

Laboratory Findings

Biochemical findings resemble those in PCT, with accumulation and
excretion of uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyl porphyrin, and isocoproporphyrin. In addition, erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin is substantially
increased.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

HEP is distinguished from CEP by increases in both uroporphyrin and
heptacarboxyl porphyrin and isocoproporphyrins. In CEP, the excess
erythrocyte porphyrins are predominantly uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I rather than protoporphyrin. Blistering skin lesions are
unusual in EPP, the excess erythrocyte protoporphyrin in that disease
is metal-­free and not complexed with zinc, and urinary porphyrins are
normal.

Treatment and Prognosis

Avoiding sunlight exposure is most important in managing HEP, as
in CEP. Oral charcoal was helpful in a severe case associated with dyserythropoiesis. Phlebotomy has shown little or no benefit. The outlook
depends on the severity of the enzyme deficiency and may be favorable
if sunlight can be avoided.

Prevention and Genetic Counseling

As part of genetic counseling in affected families, it is feasible to diagnose HEP in utero, either by analysis of porphyrins in amniotic fluid
or DNA studies.

HEREDITARY COPROPORPHYRIA

This autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria is caused by a deficiency
of CPOX. The disease presents with acute attacks, as in AIP. Cutaneous photosensitivity may occur, but much less often than in VP. Rare
homozygous cases present in childhood, including a variant form
known as harderoporphyria.

Etiology

A partial (50%) deficiency in CPOX activity has been found in all cells
studied from patients with HCP. A much more profound deficiency is
found in homozygous cases. Human CPOX is a homodimer composed
of 39-­kDa subunits and contains no metals or prosthetic groups. The
enzyme requires molecular oxygen and is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. A single active site on the enzyme catalyzes
the oxidative decarboxylation of two of the four propionic acid groups
of coproporphyrinogen III to form the two vinyl groups at positions

976 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
two and four, on rings A and B, respectively, of protoporphyrinogen
IX. Most of the intermediate tricarboxyl porphyrinogen, termed harderoporphyrinogen, is not released before undergoing the second decarboxylation to protoporphyrinogen IX. Coproporphyrinogen I is not a
substrate for this enzyme.
The human CPOX gene contains a single promoter with elements
for both housekeeping and erythroid-­
specific expression. A variety of CPOX pathogenic variants have been described in HCP, with
a predominance of missense pathogenic variants and no genotype-­
phenotype correlations. Harderoporphyria, an autosomal recessive
biochemical variant form of HCP, is caused by CPOX pathogenic variants that impair substrate binding, leading to premature release of
harderoporphyrinogen.

Epidemiology

HCP is less common than AIP and VP, but its prevalence has not been
carefully estimated. Homozygous HCP is rare and presents during
childhood. Harderoporphyria, a biochemically distinguishable variant
of HCP, has been recognized in heteroallelic and homoallelic forms.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

Increased ALA and PBG during acute attacks of HCP may be explained
by induction of ALAS1 and by the normally relatively low activity of
PBGD in the liver. Hepatic ALAS1 is increased during acute attacks but
is normal when the disease is latent and porphyrin precursor excretion
is normal. Because coproporphyrinogen III concentration in the liver
is probably less than the Km for CPOX, the reaction rate is likely to be
determined in part by substrate concentration. The substrate coproporphyrinogen appears to be lost more readily from the liver cell than,
for example, uroporphyrinogen, especially when heme synthesis is
stimulated. Coproporphyrin and coproporphyrinogen are both transported into bile and excreted in urine and do not appear to accumulate
in the liver in HCP.

Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms are identical to those of AIP except that attacks are generally milder, and cutaneous lesions that resemble those in PCT develop
occasionally. Severe motor neuropathy and respiratory paralysis can
occur. HCP is almost always latent before puberty, and symptoms are
most common in adult women. Attacks are precipitated by the same
factors that cause attacks in AIP, including fasting, OCs, and hormone
increases during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Concomitant
liver diseases may increase porphyrin retention and photosensitivity.
The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is increased.
The clinical features of homozygous HCP or harderoporphyria begin
in early childhood and include jaundice, hemolytic anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin photosensitivity. These symptoms are generally
quite distinct from those seen in heterozygotes. Hematologic features
are particularly characteristic in harderoporphyria.

Laboratory Findings

The porphyrin precursors ALA and PBG are increased during acute
attacks in HCP but may decrease more rapidly than in AIP. Marked
increases in coproporphyrin III in urine and feces are more persistent in HCP. Plasma porphyrins are usually normal or only slightly
increased.
In homozygous cases, porphyrin excretion may be more increased
and is accompanied by substantial increases in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin. Harderoporphyria is characterized by a marked increase
in fecal excretion of harderoporphyrin (tricarboxyl porphyrin) and in
coproporphyrin.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of HCP is readily established in patients with clinically
manifest disease, although urinary ALA, PBG, and uroporphyrin may
revert to normal more quickly than in AIP. Urinary coproporphyrin
III is increased. Urinary porphyrins, especially coproporphyrin, can be
increased in many medical conditions (e.g., liver disease), and small
increases that are not diagnostically significant may lead to an incorrect

diagnosis of HCP. Fecal porphyrins are mostly coproporphyrin (isomer
III) in HCP, whereas in VP, coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin are
often increased approximately equally. Plasma porphyrins are usually
normal in HCP and increased in VP.
The ratio of fecal coproporphyrin III to coproporphyrin I is especially sensitive for detecting latent heterozygotes (especially in adults).
Assays for CPOX, a mitochondrial enzyme, require cells such as
lymphocytes and are not widely available. Identification of a CPOX
pathogenic variant in an index case greatly facilitates screening family
members.

Treatment and Prognosis

Acute attacks of HCP are treated as in AIP, which includes IV hemin
and identifying and avoiding precipitating factors. Phlebotomy and
chloroquine are not effective. GnRH analogs can be effective for prevention of cyclic attacks. The prognosis is generally better than in AIP.
Givosiran, an siRNA therapeutic agent, has been approved for the prevention of acute attacks in all acute hepatic porphyrias, although experience in HCP is limited.
Prevention and genetic counseling are the same as in other acute
porphyrias.

VARIEGATE PORPHYRIA

This hepatic porphyria is caused by a deficiency of protoporphyrinogen
oxidase (PPOX), which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
The disorder is termed variegate because it can present with neurologic
or cutaneous manifestations or both. Other terms have included porphyria variegata, protocoproporphyria, and South African genetic porphyria. Rare cases of homozygous VP are symptomatic in childhood.

Etiology

PPOX is approximately half-­normal in all cells studied in patients with
VP. The enzyme is more markedly deficient in rare cases of homozygous VP, with approximately half-­normal enzyme activity in parents.
Human PPOX is a homodimer that contains flavin adenine dinucleotide and is localized to the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Membrane-­binding domains may be docked onto
human FECH, the next enzyme in the pathway, which is embedded
in the opposite side of the membrane. PPOX catalyzes the oxidation
of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX by the removal of six
hydrogen atoms. The enzyme requires molecular oxygen. The substrate
is readily oxidized nonenzymatically to protoporphyrin under aerobic
conditions or if exported into the cytosol. PPOX is highly specific for
protoporphyrinogen IX and is inhibited by tetrapyrroles such as heme,
biliverdin, and bilirubin and by certain herbicides that cause protoporphyrin to accumulate and induce phototoxicity in plants. Inhibition by
bilirubin may account for decreased PPOX activity in Gilbert disease.
The human PPOX gene consists of one noncoding and 12 coding
exons. Many PPOX pathogenic variants have been reported in VP
families. A missense pathogenic variant, R59W, is prevalent in South
Africa. No convincing genotype-­phenotype correlations have been
identified. Pathogenic variants in homozygous cases of VP are more
likely to encode enzyme proteins with residual activity.

Epidemiology

VP is less common than AIP in most countries. The R59W pathogenic
variant is highly prevalent in South African Whites (3 in 1,000 in this
population). This example of “genetic drift” or founder effect has been
traced to a man or his wife who emigrated from Holland to South
Africa in 1688. In Finland, prevalence is 1.3 in 100,000 people and is
about as common as AIP.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

Acute attacks develop in a minority of heterozygotes for PPOX deficiency and are often attributable to drugs, steroids, and nutritional
factors that play a role in other acute porphyrias. Protoporphyrinogen IX accumulates and undergoes autoxidation to protoporphyrin
IX. Coproporphyrinogen III accumulates, perhaps as the result of a
close functional association between PPOX in the inner mitochondrial

membrane and CPOX in the intermembrane space. Liver porphyrin
content is not increased. The increased porphyrin content in plasma
consists of porphyrin-­peptide conjugates, which may be formed from
protoporphyrinogen. Increased ALA and PBG during acute attacks
may be explained, as in HCP, by induction of ALAS1 by exacerbating
factors and by the normally relatively low activity of PBGD in liver.
Furthermore, PBGD is inhibited by protoporphyrinogen, the substrate
for PPOX.

Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms develop in some heterozygotes after puberty. Neurovisceral
symptoms occurring as acute attacks are identical to AIP but are generally milder and less often fatal. Drugs, steroids, and nutritional alterations such as fasting, which are harmful in AIP, can also induce attacks
of VP. Attacks occur equally in males and females, at least in South
Africa. Cutaneous fragility, vesicles, bullae, hyperpigmentation, and
hypertrichosis of sun-­exposed areas are much more common than in
HCP. They are likely to occur apart from and to be longer lasting than
the neurovisceral symptoms. OCs can precipitate cutaneous manifestations. Acute attacks have become less common, and skin manifestations are more frequently the initial presentation; this may result from
earlier diagnosis and counseling. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
is increased.
Symptoms of homozygous VP begin in infancy or childhood. These
children generally have severe photosensitivity, neurologic symptoms,
seizures, developmental disturbances, and sometimes growth retardation, but they do not have acute attacks.

Laboratory Findings

Urinary ALA, PBG, and uroporphyrin are increased during acute
attacks, but often less so than in AIP, and may be normal or only
slightly increased during remission. Plasma porphyrins, urinary
coproporphyrin III, and fecal coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin
are more persistently increased between attacks. The pattern of urinary
porphyrins can sometime resemble that seen in PCT. Erythrocyte zinc
protoporphyrin levels are greatly increased in homozygous VP and
may be modestly increased in heterozygous cases.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

VP is readily distinguished biochemically from AIP and HCP, which
also present with acute attacks and increases in PBG. Plasma porphyrin analysis is especially useful because the plasma porphyrins in VP
are tightly protein bound, resulting in a characteristic fluorescence
emission spectrum at neutral pH. Fecal porphyrins are increased, with
approximately equal amounts of coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin. Fluorometric detection of plasma porphyrins is more sensitive
than stool porphyrin analysis in asymptomatic VP. PPOX assays using
cells that contain mitochondria, such as lymphocytes, are sensitive for
identifying asymptomatic carriers but are not widely available. Knowing the PPOX pathogenic variant in an index case enables the identification of relatives who carry the same pathogenic variant.

Treatment

Acute attacks are treated as in AIP. Hemin is beneficial for acute attacks
but not for cutaneous symptoms. Light protection is important in
patients with skin manifestations, using long-­sleeved clothing, gloves,
a broad-­
brimmed hat, and opaque sunscreen preparations. Exposure to short-­wavelength UV light, which does not excite porphyrins,
may increase skin pigmentation and provide some protection. Phlebotomy and chloroquine are not effective. Surprisingly, oral activated
charcoal was reported to increase porphyrin levels and worsen skin
manifestations.

Prognosis and Prevention

The outlook of patients with VP has improved, which may be attributed
to improved treatment, earlier diagnosis, and detection of latent cases.
Cyclic acute attacks in women can be prevented with a GnRH analog,
as in AIP. Givosiran, an siRNA therapeutic agent, has been approved for
the prevention of acute attacks in all acute hepatic porphyrias, although

experience in VP is limited. A diagnosis of VP or any other acute porphyria should not lead to difficulty obtaining insurance, because the
prognosis is usually good once the diagnosis is established.
Genetic counseling is the same as in other acute porphyrias.

ERYTHROPOIETIC PROTOPORPHYRIA AND
X-­LINKED PROTOPORPHYRIA

These forms of protoporphyria are genetically distinct but have essentially the same phenotype. In EPP, an autosomal recessive disorder, protoporphyrin accumulates as the result of a marked deficiency of FECH,
the last enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, because of FECH
pathogenic variants. EPP is sometimes termed erythrohepatic protoporphyria, although the liver does not contribute substantially to production of excess protoporphyrin. XLP is the most recently described
porphyria, in which gain-­of-­function ALAS2 pathogenic variants lead
to overproduction of ALA in the marrow, where it is metabolized to
excess amounts of protoporphyrin.

Etiology

Ferrochelatase (FECH), the enzyme that is deficient in EPP, catalyzes
the final step in heme synthesis, which is insertion of ferrous iron
(Fe2+) into protoporphyrin IX (see Fig. 112.1). The enzyme is also
termed heme synthetase or protoheme ferrolyase. The human enzyme is
a dimer, and each homodimer contains a [2Fe-­2S] cluster, which may
have a role in bridging homodimers. FECH is found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where its active site faces the mitochondrial
matrix. It may be associated with complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and the ferrous iron substrate may be produced
on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation. FECH is specific for
the reduced form of iron but can use other metals, such as Zn2+ and
Co2+, and other dicarboxyl porphyrins. Accumulation of metal-­free
protoporphyrin rather than zinc protoporphyrin in EPP indicates that
formation of the latter is dependent on FECH activity in vivo.
The human FECH gene has a single promoter sequence and contains 11 exons. Two mRNAs of 1.6 and 2.5 kb were described, which
may be explained by the use of two alternative polyadenylation signals. The larger transcript is more abundant in murine erythroid cells,
suggesting erythroid-­specific regulation of FECH. A variety of FECH
pathogenic variants have been reported in EPP, including missense,
nonsense, and splicing pathogenic variants; small and large deletions;
and an insertion.
The inheritance of two alleles associated with reduced FECH activity is required for disease expression. This is consistent with FECH
activities as low as 15–25% of normal in EPP patients. In most patients,
a pathogenic variant on one FECH allele is combined with a common variant affecting the other allele. This common-­variant FECH
allele (IVS3-­48T>C) produces less-­than-­normal amounts of enzyme
because it expresses an aberrantly spliced mRNA that is degraded by
a nonsense-­mediated RNA decay mechanism. The IVS3-­48T>C FECH
variant by itself does not cause disease, even when homozygous. In a
few families, two severe FECH pathogenic variants have been found
without the IVS3-­48T>C allele. EPP with autosomal recessive inheritance occurs naturally in cattle and in mouse models.
XLP is associated with gain-­of-­function deletions in the last exon of
ALAS2. These lesions delete the last 10-­20 amino acids of the ALAS2
polypeptide and apparently make the enzyme more stable. Metal-­
free protoporphyrin predominates in erythrocytes in these cases, but
because FECH activity is normal, the proportion of zinc protoporphyrin is greater than in EPP. XLP accounts for approximately 2% of cases
with the EPP phenotype in Europe and approximately 10% of cases in
North America.
EPP is sometimes associated with myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorders and expansion of a clone of hematopoietic cells with
deletion of one FECH allele or with other FECH pathogenic variants.
In such cases there is late onset of the disease.

Epidemiology

EPP is the most common porphyria to cause symptoms in children
but is often not diagnosed until adult life. Overall, it is the third most

978 Part IX u Metabolic Disorders
common porphyria, although its prevalence is not precisely known
(see Table 112.2). An analysis from the UK biobank exome sequencing
data suggests that EPP is 1.7-­3.0 times more common than previously
thought in the UK. It is described mostly in Whites but occurs in other
ancestries. The IVS3-­48T>C splice variant is common in Whites and
Japanese but rare in Africans, which explains lower disease prevalence
in populations of African origin.

Pathology and Pathogenesis

FECH is deficient in all tissues in EPP, but bone marrow reticulocytes
are thought to be the primary source of the excess protoporphyrin,
some of which enters plasma and circulates to the skin. Circulating
erythrocytes are no longer synthesizing heme and hemoglobin, but
they contain excess free protoporphyrin, which also contributes. In
XLP caused by terminal deletions in exon 11 of ALAS2, all intermediates of the heme pathway are overproduced and ultimately accumulate
in bone marrow erythroblasts as protoporphyrin. FECH is not deficient in XLP, so this enzyme chelates some of the excess protoporphyrin with zinc. An aberrantly spliced mitoferrin transcript, which limits
iron transport into mitochondria, has also been described in EPP. The
liver functions as an excretory organ rather than a major source for
excess protoporphyrin. FECH deficiency in the skin and liver may be
important, however, because tissue transplantation studies in mice
suggest that skin photosensitivity and liver damage occur only when
FECH is deficient in these tissues.
Patients with EPP and XLP are maximally sensitive to light in the
400-­nm range, which corresponds to the so-­called Soret band, the narrow peak absorption maximum that is characteristic for protoporphyrin and other porphyrins. Having absorbed light, porphyrins enter an
excited energy state and release energy as fluorescence, singlet oxygen,
and other ROS. Resulting tissue damage is accompanied by lipid peroxidation, oxidation of amino acids, cross linking of proteins in cell membranes, and damage to capillary endothelial cells. Such damage may
be mediated by photoactivation of the complement system and release
of histamine, kinins, and chemotactic factors. Repeated acute damage
leads to thickening of the vessel walls and perivascular deposits from
accumulation of serum components. Deposition of amorphous material containing immunoglobulin, complement components, glycoproteins, acid glycosaminoglycans, and lipids occurs around blood vessels
in the upper dermis.
There is little evidence for impaired erythropoiesis or hemolysis
in EPP. However, mild anemia with microcytosis, hypochromia, and
reticulocytosis is common. Iron accumulation in erythroblasts and
ring sideroblasts has been noted in bone marrow in some patients.
Decreased transferrin saturation and low or low-­normal serum ferritin suggest iron deficiency. Iron status should be carefully evaluated in
EPP patients. Poor response to oral iron supplements is described in
EPP and is unexplained, because iron absorption is not impaired. Some
patients report increased photosensitivity when given iron supplements, but whether this is from transient increases in porphyrins when
iron deficiency is corrected and erythropoiesis increases is not known.
Case reports suggest that iron supplementation decreases protoporphyrin and improves anemia, especially in patients with XLP. However,
recent evidence suggests that iron deficiency may reduce protoporphyrin levels in some EPP patients.
Liver damage develops in a small proportion of EPP and XLP
patients and is attributed to excess protoporphyrin, which is insoluble
in water and excreted only by hepatic uptake and biliary excretion.
Some may be reabsorbed by the intestine and undergo enterohepatic
circulation. At very high levels, protoporphyrin is cholestatic, can damage cholangiocytes, and can accumulate in hepatocytes to form crystalline structures and impair mitochondrial function.

Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms of cutaneous photosensitivity begin in childhood and consist of acute pain and itching, often occurring within minutes of sunlight exposure and followed by redness and swelling with continued
exposure (Fig. 112.7). Petechiae and purpuric lesions may be seen,
but blisters are rare. Swelling may resemble angioneurotic edema and

solar urticaria. Symptoms are usually worse in the spring and summer.
Chronic changes may include lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles,
labial grooving, and nail changes, but changes in pigmentation and
pronounced scarring are unusual. Although physical findings in EPP
and XLP may not be impressive, efforts to avoid sunlight and resulting
symptoms significantly impair quality of life. An association between
EPP caused by pathogenic variants affecting both FECH alleles and
seasonal palmar keratoderma is unexplained. Neuropathy develops
only in some patients with severe hepatic decompensation. XLP males
have a more severe phenotype with higher protoporphyrin levels than
most EPP patients. XLP females have a variable clinical presentation—
some with no symptoms or mild symptoms and others with severe
symptoms similar to XLP males. This variability in females is likely the
result of random X chromosome inactivation.
Unless hepatic or other complications develop, protoporphyrin levels and symptoms of photosensitivity remain remarkably stable for
many years in most patients. Factors that exacerbate hepatic porphyrias play little or no role in EPP or XLP. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin
levels may decrease and sunlight tolerance may improve during pregnancy, which is unexplained.

Laboratory Findings

Protoporphyrin is substantially increased in circulating erythrocytes in
EPP and consists almost entirely of metal-­free protoporphyrin. In XLP,
both zinc protoporphyrin and metal-­free protoporphyrin are increased,
although the latter still predominates. Protoporphyrin is also increased
in bone marrow, plasma, bile, and feces. Other porphyrins and porphyrin precursors are normal in uncomplicated EPP and XLP.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

A diagnosis of EPP is confirmed biochemically by finding a substantially elevated concentration of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin,
which is predominantly (at least 85%) metal-­free and not complexed
with zinc. In XLP, both metal-­free and zinc-­complexed protoporphyrins are elevated. Erythrocyte total protoporphyrin levels are, on
average, higher in XLP and more variable between individuals in EPP,
possibly reflecting differences in severity of the many reported FECH
pathogenic variants. Erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration is
increased with little increase in metal-­free protoporphyrin in homozygous porphyrias (except CEP), iron deficiency, lead poisoning, anemia
of chronic disease, hemolytic conditions, and many other erythrocytic
disorders. Measurement of FECH activity requires cells containing
mitochondria and is not widely available.

Chapter 112 u The Porphyrias 979
Plasma total porphyrin concentration is often less increased in EPP
than in other cutaneous porphyrias and may be normal. Great care must
be taken to avoid light exposure during sample processing, because
plasma porphyrins in EPP are particularly subject to photodegradation.
Urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are not increased.
DNA studies are strongly recommended for confirming FECH or
ALAS2 pathogenic variants and for genetic counseling.
Life-­threatening protoporphyric hepatopathy is characterized by
greater increases in erythrocyte and plasma protoporphyrin levels,
increased photosensitivity, and either chronically abnormal liver function tests or rapidly progressive hepatic failure. Presumably this is heralded by increases above the patient’s baseline erythrocyte and plasma
porphyrin levels, but this has not been documented, because most such
patients have not had sufficiently long-­term determinations of porphyrin values. Increases in urinary porphyrins, especially coproporphyrin,
in this setting are attributable to liver dysfunction.

Complications

There is an increased risk of biliary stones, which contain protoporphyrin and are sometimes symptomatic, requiring cholecystectomy.
Protoporphyric hepatopathy occurs in <5% of protoporphyria patients,
including children, and may be chronic or progress rapidly to death
from liver failure. Rarely, hepatopathy is the major presenting feature of
EPP or XLP. Protoporphyric hepatopathy can cause acute upper abdominal pain suggesting biliary obstruction, and unnecessary laparotomy to
exclude this possibility can be detrimental. Other types of liver disease,
such as viral hepatitis or alcohol-­or drug-­induced liver disease, must
be excluded, or may contribute to the development of protoporphyric
hepatopathy. Whether iron deficiency may contribute is unclear. Liver
histology shows marked deposition of protoporphyrin as inclusions in
liver cells and bile canaliculi. The bone marrow is probably the major
source of protoporphyrin, even in EPP patients with hepatic failure.

Treatment

Exposure to sunlight should be avoided, which is aided by wearing closely woven clothing. Beta-­carotene, oral cysteine, and vitamin
C have no proven efficacy. One report suggested that high doses of
cimetidine were effective in reducing symptoms in three children with
EPP, but no objective clinical evidence of efficacy was presented.
Increasing skin melanin by narrow-­band UV-­B phototherapy may
improve sunlight tolerance. Studies in the United States and Europe of
afamelanotide, a synthetic analog of melanocyte-­stimulating hormone,
darkened the skin, increased pain-­free sun exposure, and improved
quality of life in patients with protoporphyria. This drug is approved
for use in adults in Europe and the United States. Dersimelagon, an
orally administered small molecule and a selective melanocortin-­1
receptor (MC1R) agonist that increases skin melanin, is currently in
phase 3 trials in EPP and XLP in the United States and other countries.
Drugs or hormone preparations that impair hepatic excretory
function should be avoided. Iron deficiency should be corrected, particularly in XLP. Vitamin D supplementation and hepatitis A and B
vaccination are recommended.
Treatment of protoporphyric hepatopathy must be individualized
and exclude other causes of liver disease. Spontaneous resolution may

occur, especially if another reversible cause of liver dysfunction, such as
viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse, is contributing. In patients with severe
hepatic decompensation, combined treatment with plasmapheresis,
transfusion to correct anemia and suppress erythropoiesis, IV hemin
to suppress erythroid and possibly hepatic protoporphyrin production,
ursodeoxycholic acid, vitamin E, and cholestyramine may be beneficial
and bridge patients to liver transplantation.
Motor neuropathy resembling that seen in acute porphyrias sometimes develops in protoporphyria patients with liver disease before
or after transfusion or liver transplantation and is sometimes reversible. Artificial lights, such as operating room lights during liver transplantation or other surgery, may cause severe photosensitivity, with
extensive burns of the skin and peritoneum and damage to circulating
erythrocytes.
Although liver disease may recur in the transplanted liver as a result
of continued bone marrow production of excess protoporphyrin, outcomes are comparable to transplantation for other types of liver disease.
Bone marrow transplantation can be considered after liver transplantation if a suitable donor is available.

Prognosis

Typical EPP patients have lifelong photosensitivity but can otherwise
expect normal longevity. Protoporphyric liver disease is often life-­
threatening; however, the incidence is low.

Prevention and Genetic Counseling

Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding sunlight. Avoiding agents that
may cause liver damage may help prevent liver complications. Opinions vary on the value of iron replacement, and this is currently under
study.
DNA studies to identify FECH pathogenic variants, the common
IVS3–48T>C FECH hypoexpression allele, or ALAS2 exon 11 deletions
are important for genetic counseling. When EPP is caused by a severe
FECH pathogenic variant and the common IVS3–48T>C FECH allele,
DNA studies in the spouse to determine the presence, or more likely
the absence, of the hypoexpression allele can predict whether offspring
are at risk for EPP. EPP may improve during pregnancy.

DUAL PORPHYRIA

An unusual pattern of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins has led to
documentation of pathogenic variants of two heme pathway enzymes.
One such patient presented with acute porphyria and had heterozygous
pathogenic variants of both CPOX and ALAD. Another had symptoms
of AIP and PCT and was reported to have both HMBS and UROD
pathogenic variants. In other reported cases, one or both enzyme deficiencies were based on enzyme measurements.

PORPHYRIA RESULTING FROM TUMORS

Erythropoietic porphyrias can develop late in life in patients with
myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative diseases and clonal expansion of
erythroid cells with an inherited or somatic pathogenic variant of an
enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway.

concentrations. In young children, signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are suggestive but nonspecific; thus the reliance on signs and
symptoms to indicate hypoglycemia in this age-­group may be problematic (Table 113.1).
In older children, evidence of hypoglycemia is based on Whipple’s
triad: (1) signs and symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) a low
plasma glucose concentration, and (3) resolution of the symptoms with
normalization of the plasma glucose concentration.
100

Glucose plays a central role in fuel metabolism and energy storage
in the body. It provides 38 mol of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per
mole of glucose oxidized. Glucose is also essential for energy metabolism in the brain, where it is the preferred substrate. Its use accounts
for nearly all the brain’s oxygen consumption. Cerebral transport of
glucose is a glucose transporter-­
1 (GLUT-­
1)–facilitated diffusion
process that is dependent on blood glucose concentration and not regulated by insulin. Low concentrations of blood glucose result in cerebral
glucopenia, energy failure, and brain injury. An elaborate regulatory
system has evolved to maintain glucose homeostasis and prevent
plasma glucose from falling precipitously to levels that impair brain
function. The defense against hypoglycemia includes the autonomic
nervous system and hormones that act in concert to enhance glucose
production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, while simultaneously limiting peripheral glucose use, which conserves glucose
for cerebral metabolism. With prolonged fasting, fat stores are mobilized via lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation in the liver results in the
generation of ketone bodies, an alternative fuel source for the brain
(Fig. 113.1). Hypoglycemia results from a failure in one or several of
these fasting mechanisms that normally integrate glucose homeostasis.

DEFINITION

Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose concentration low
enough to cause signs and symptoms of brain dysfunction (Fig. 113.2).

SIGNIFICANCE AND SEQUELAE

Brain metabolism uses the majority of endogenous hepatic glucose
production in neonates, infants, and children. Because the brain grows
most rapidly in the first year of life and a larger proportion of glucose
turnover is used for brain metabolism, hypoglycemia in infants and
children can affect brain development and function and can result in
developmental delays and learning disabilities. The brain also has the
capacity to absorb and oxidize ketone bodies. However, the capacity of
the liver to produce ketone bodies is limited in the immediate newborn
period. This is especially restricted in the presence of hyperinsulinism (HI), which acutely inhibits hepatic glucose output, lipolysis, and
ketogenesis, thereby depriving the brain of any alternative fuel sources.
Furthermore, although the brain can metabolize ketones, these alternative fuels cannot completely replace glucose as an essential central
nervous system (CNS) fuel. The deprivation of the brain’s major energy
source during hypoglycemic events has predictable adverse consequences on brain metabolism and growth. These arise from decreased
brain oxygen consumption and increased breakdown of endogenous
structural brain components, with impairment and loss of functional
membrane integrity.
The major long-­term sequelae of hypoglycemia are developmental
delays, learning disabilities, epilepsy, and behavioral issues. A prospective cohort study of neonates at risk for hypoglycemia found that at
4 years of age, children who had experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia during the neonatal period had a two-­to threefold increased
risk of low executive and visual-­motor function with greater impairment in children with severe or recurrent episodes. Cross-­sectional
studies in children with HI have found that 26–48% of children with
both transient and persistent forms of HI have abnormal neurodevelopment. Children with HI have the highest risk of neurologic damage given the severity of the hypoglycemia in the condition and their
inability to generate ketones as an alternative fuel for the brain. In addition, hypoglycemia associated with hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy
increases the risk of CNS sequalae. However, there are no precise data

relating the duration or severity of hypoglycemia to subsequent neurologic development of children in a predictable manner. Nonetheless,
early detection of hypoglycemia and effective treatment are critical to
mitigating the risk of brain damage and developmental delays. Many
neonates may have asymptomatic hypoglycemia identified by routine
screening or laboratory testing. Although asymptomatic hypoglycemia
in an otherwise healthy newborn is usually benign and transient, there
remains a risk that if untreated (glucose gel, human milk, formula feedings), the hypoglycemia may become symptomatic. Hypoglycemia in
older children may also produce long-­term neurologic defects through
neuronal death, mediated in part by cerebral excitotoxins released during hypoglycemia.

PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS OF GLUCOSE
HOMEOSTASIS

Fetal glucose is derived entirely from the mother through placental-­
facilitated diffusion; therefore fetal glucose concentration reflects, but
is slightly lower than, maternal glucose levels. After birth, plasma glucose decreases, reaching a nadir at about 2 hours of life and remaining
below the normal adult range of 70-­100 mg/dL for the first 3-­4 days of
life; this is known as transitional hypoglycemia. A study of healthy, full-­
term infants found a mean plasma glucose concentration of 59 ± 11
mg/dL during the first 48 hours of life, which then increased to 83 ± 13
mg/dL during days 4-­5 of life (Fig. 113.3). Transitional asymptomatic
hypoglycemia is likely caused by a persistence of fetal pancreatic β-­cell
fuel metabolism, which allows for the secretion of insulin at lower glucose concentrations to support insulin-­mediated fetal growth. Beyond
this transitional period, plasma glucose concentration and mechanisms that regulate glucose homeostasis in neonates are the same as in
older children and adults.
During fasting, mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of
glucose homeostasis include glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation, as well as the hormones that regulate
the activation of these processes (see Fig. 113.1). Plasma glucose
concentrations are maintained by both metabolism of the nutrients
consumed in the immediate postprandial period and then by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis starting 2-­4 hours after the meal.
The liver of a 10-­kg child contains 20-­25 g of glycogen, which is sufficient to meet normal glucose requirements of 4-­6 mg/kg/minute
during an overnight fast. Glucose production during this time is
augmented by gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 113.1). Defects in glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis may not be manifested in infants until
the frequent feeding pattern at 3-­to 4-­hour intervals ceases and
infants sleep through the night, a situation usually present by 3-­6
months of age.
With prolonged fasting, the glycogen stores are depleted, and
energy metabolism is more dependent on fatty acid and ketone oxidation. Lipolysis generates fatty acids, which undergo β-­oxidation in
the liver to generate ketone bodies. Peripheral tissues use free fatty
acids (FFAs) and ketones, whereas the CNS can use ketones for a

portion of its energy needs. Defects in β-­oxidation and ketogenesis
may not manifest until fasting exceeds the overnight period or, with
illnesses, result in catabolism, fasting, and increased body energy
requirements.
Amino acid precursors for gluconeogenesis are derived primarily
from muscle protein. The muscle bulk of infants and small children is
substantially smaller relative to body mass than that of adults, whereas
glucose requirements per unit of body mass are greater in children.
Therefore the ability to compensate for glucose deprivation by gluconeogenesis is more limited in infants and young children, as is the ability to
withstand fasting for prolonged periods. The ability of muscle to generate
alanine, the principal gluconeogenic amino acid, may also be limited.
The switch from glycogen synthesis during and immediately after
meals to glycogen breakdown and later gluconeogenesis is governed
by hormones, with insulin of central importance (see Fig. 113.1).
After a meal, plasma insulin concentrations increase to peak levels
of 5-­to 10-­fold greater than their normal baseline concentration,
which serves to lower the plasma glucose through the enhancement
of peripheral glucose uptake, activation of glycogen synthesis, and
inhibition of gluconeogenesis. In addition, lipogenesis is stimulated, whereas lipolysis and ketogenesis are curtailed. During fasting, plasma insulin concentrations fall, and together with the rise of
counter-­regulatory hormones, result in maintenance of plasma glucose concentration (see Fig. 113.1).
These counter-­regulatory hormones—glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, and epinephrine—act synergistically and in concert
to increase plasma glucose concentrations by activating glycogenolytic enzymes (glucagon, epinephrine); inducing gluconeogenic
enzymes (glucagon, cortisol); inhibiting glucose uptake by muscle
(epinephrine, growth hormone, cortisol); mobilizing amino acids
from muscle for gluconeogenesis (cortisol); activating lipolysis and
thereby providing glycerol for gluconeogenesis and fatty acids for
ketogenesis (epinephrine, cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon); and
inhibiting insulin release and promoting growth hormone and glucagon secretion (epinephrine).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Clinical features of hypoglycemia fall into two categories: (1) symptoms and signs associated with the activation of the autonomic nervous system and epinephrine release (autonomic symptoms) and (2)
symptoms and signs caused by decreased cerebral glucose use (neuroglycopenic symptoms) (see Table 113.1). In newborns and infants,
symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia may be subtler and include
cyanosis, apnea, hypothermia, hypotonia, irritability, jitteriness, poor
feeding, lethargy, and seizures. It is important to note that neonates and
infants are frequently asymptomatic when hypoglycemic.

DIAGNOSIS

Infants and children with a suspected hypoglycemia disorder require a
timely and comprehensive diagnostic workup to establish the underlying
cause and to initiate specific treatment, prevent hypoglycemia, and minimize the risk of brain damage and neurologic dysfunction. The Pediatric
Endocrine Society provides guidelines that outline which children and
adolescents should be evaluated for a hypoglycemia disorder:
u Older children and adolescents who demonstrate Whipple’s triad
u Infants and younger children (who cannot communicate symptoms)
with plasma glucoses <60 mg/dL on laboratory-­quality assays
u Neonates at high risk of a persistent hypoglycemic disorder
u Glucose screening is recommended for those born large for gestational age, a history of perinatal stress, premature or postmature
delivery, infants of diabetic mothers, family history of hypoglycemia disorder, or a congenital syndrome associated with hypoglycemia.
u 
A persistent hypoglycemia disorder should be ruled out in those
with severe hypoglycemia (symptomatic or requiring intravenous
[IV] dextrose), inability to maintain plasma glucose >50 mg/dL (up
to 48 hours of life) or >60 mg/dL (after 48 hours of life), family history of a genetic form of hypoglycemia, and those with a congenital
syndrome associated with hypoglycemia.

The etiology of hypoglycemia varies based on the age of the child,
associated clinical and laboratory features, and more detailed diagnostic testing, including gene panels or whole exome sequencing (Tables
113.2, 113.3, 113.4, and 113.5).
A thorough history and physical exam may provide clinical clues to
the underlying diagnosis (see Table 113.2). Evaluation for hypoglycemia disorders requires obtaining blood and urine at the time of hypoglycemia, ideally when the plasma glucose is <50 mg/dL. This “critical
sample” is used to measure hormones, which regulate glucose metabolism, and metabolic fuels (Table 113.6, Fig. 113.4). The critical sample
can be obtained during a spontaneous episode of hypoglycemia or during a supervised diagnostic fast. Given the likelihood of hypoglycemia,
a diagnostic fast should be performed in a hospital setting with close
supervision and placement of an IV catheter to facilitate obtaining the
critical sample. Point-­of-­care glucose (and β-­hydroxybutyrate if available) should be followed closely, so the samples can be obtained as soon
as the plasma glucose falls below 50 mg/dL. The evaluation of neonates
should not occur during the first 48-­72 hours of life to avoid the period
of transitional hypoglycemia.
After the critical sample is obtained and before the child is allowed
to eat, a glucagon stimulation test should be performed to assess for
hyperinsulinism. While the child is still hypoglycemic, 1 mg of glucagon is administered, and glucose is measured by a point-­of-­care meter
every 10 minutes for a total of 40 minutes. A greater than 30-­point
rise in plasma glucose concentration is consistent with insulin excess
or hyperinsulinism. If children do not have an increase in their glucose
during the first 20 minutes of the test, the test should be terminated and
the child should be given juice or IV dextrose as rescue therapy.
The levels of alternative fuels at the time of hypoglycemia (β-­
hydroxybutyrate, FFAs, and lactate) allow for the classification of the
hypoglycemia disorders into four distinct groups (see Fig. 113.4). The
results from the critical sample then allow for narrowing of the differential and guide additional testing. Interpretation of the critical
sample results has several important caveats. Low cortisol and growth
hormone levels on the critical sample are not diagnostic of a hormone
deficiency, and in most cases, the appropriate (specific) stimulation
testing is needed if these levels are low. Additionally, a low or undetectable insulin level does not rule out hyperinsulinism. Insulin concentrations can be affected by hemolysis, and assays have variable sensitivity
for detecting insulin. Other biomarkers of insulin effect, such as β-­
hydroxybutyrate (to evaluate ketogenesis), FFAs (to evaluate lipolysis),
and the glycemic response to glucagon (to evaluate glycogenolysis),
should be used to assess for hyperinsulinism.

MANAGEMENT
Acute Treatment

A child presenting with hypoglycemia should be rapidly treated with
oral carbohydrates or IV dextrose to normalize their plasma glucose
(>70 mg/dL). If the child is asymptomatic or has mild symptoms and is
capable of oral intake, the hypoglycemia can be treated with 15 grams
of rapid-­acting carbohydrates, such as 4 ounces of juice or two graham
crackers. If a child is symptomatic or unable to tolerate oral intake (risk
of aspiration, impending depressed level of consciousness), 2 mL/kg of
dextrose 10% water (D10W) should be administered. After administration of the bolus, the child should be placed on an IV dextrose infusion (for infants, a glucose infusion rate of 5-­6 mg/kg/minute and for
older children 2-­3 mg/kg/minute) to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia.
Plasma glucose via point-­of-­care testing should be monitored every 15-­
20 minutes until it is >70 mg/dL, and then checks may be spaced once
stable levels are demonstrated.
In an asymptomatic child with a plasma glucose <50 mg/dL, a critical
sample can be obtained if the appropriate supplies and tubes are readily
available. Otherwise, treatment of the hypoglycemia should not be delayed.

management. Rev Endo Metab Dis. 2020;21:577–597, Table 2.

Ongoing Management

Treatment goals of hypoglycemia disorders include maintaining
euglycemia (plasma glucose >70 mg/dL), promoting normal development, and monitoring for medication side effects. Once the diagnostic evaluation identifies a specific hypoglycemia disorder, tailored
treatment should be initiated promptly. Effective treatment allows the
child to maintain euglycemia, both while eating an age-­appropriate
diet and fasting overnight. Continuous or forced feeds should not
be used as treatment for hypoglycemia, as they result in long-­term
oral aversion and excessive weight gain. Additionally, hypoglycemia
should not routinely be treated with steroids or cornstarch unless
indicated as a treatment for specific disorders, such as adrenal insufficiency or glycogen storage disease. Home glucose monitoring is
required for all children with hypoglycemia disorders and is particularly important during times of illnesses, as this may provoke additional hypoglycemia.
Management of individual hypoglycemia disorders is given in more
detail in the following sections and in Table 113.7.

DISORDERS OF HYPOGLYCEMIA

Disorders of hypoglycemia can be classified by the metabolic fuel
response to fasting (see Fig. 113.4).

Insulin-­Mediated Disorders

Insulin-­mediated disorders (see Table 113.4) are characterized by low
plasma β-­hydroxybutyrate and FFAs and a positive glycemic response
to glucagon (Table 113.8).

Hyperinsulinism

HI is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and
children. HI is caused by dysregulated insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-­cells, resulting in severe and recurrent hypoglycemia (Fig.
113.5). HI can be categorized into three main forms: (1) perinatal
stress-­induced, (2) congenital or monogenic (see Table 113.4), and (3)
syndromic (see Table 113.5).
Perinatal stress-­induced HI (PSHI), the most common form of HI,
occurs in the setting of stress on the fetus in utero or during delivery.

In a study of 514 neonates at risk of hypoglycemia, 19% of late-­preterm
and small-­for-­gestational-­age (SGA) infants had recurrent hypoglycemia, which is concerning for PSHI. Common causes of PSHI include
intrauterine growth restriction, being born SGA, maternal preeclampsia, birth asphyxia, and congenital heart disease. Most infants with PSHI
respond to diazoxide, although a subset, particularly those with liver
dysfunction and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, may fail to respond.
PSHI typically resolves within the first 3-­6 months of life.
Congenital HI is the result of genetic defects in the insulin secretory pathways of the β-­cell. It is estimated to occur in 1:28,000-­50,000
live births but may be as high as 1:3,000 in populations with a high
frequency of consanguinity. The most common and severe type of congenital HI is caused by inactivating pathogenic variants of ABCC8 and
KCNJ11, which encode the ATP-­sensitive potassium (KATP) channel of
the β-­cell. Infants born with KATP-­HI are commonly large for gestation
age and have high glucose requirements (glucose infusion rate [GIR]
>10 mg/kg/min) (see Fig. 113.5). However, the spectrum of presentation is wide, and some infants have normal birthweights and lower
glucose requirements. In addition to fasting hypoglycemia, children
with this type of HI have protein-­induced hypoglycemia, in which
isolated protein ingestion leads to increased insulin secretion and low
plasma glucose. KATP-­HI is most frequently unresponsive to treatment

985

with diazoxide, the only approved drug for HI, which acts on the KATP
channel.
KATP-­HI has two distinct histologic forms: a diffuse form, in which
β-­cells throughout the pancreas show evidence of hyperactivity, and
a focal form, characterized by a localized area of β-­cell overgrowth
or adenomatosis. The diffuse form is caused by biallelic recessive
pathogenic variants in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 or, less commonly, monoallelic dominant pathogenic variants of these genes. Focal HI occurs
as a result of a “two-­hit” mechanism: a paternally inherited recessive
pathogenic variant in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 combined with somatic loss
of the maternal 11p15 region, resulting in paternal uniparental isodisomy. Infants with the focal form are cured with resection of the focal
lesion. In contrast, those with the diffuse form may require a palliative near-­total pancreatectomy if intensive medical therapy fails to
control the hypoglycemia (Fig. 113.6). Given the different treatment
approaches and outcomes for the diffuse and focal forms of KATP-­HI,
distinguishing between the two is critical and is best done through
genetic testing. A paternally inherited recessive pathogenic variant
in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 has a 94% positive predictive value for focal
KATP-­HI.
In children with genetic testing consistent with the focal form, an
18-­fluoro L-­3,4-­dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography (18F-­DOPA PET) scan is used before surgery to localize the focal
lesion (see Fig. 113.6). Frozen section evaluation of biopsies taken
during surgery is used to confirm the presence of the focal lesion and
guides the extent of the resection. Children with the focal form of HI
should receive care at specialized centers with 18F-­DOPA PET access
and a multidisciplinary team of endocrinologists, surgeons, pathologists, and radiologists with expertise in HI. Children with the diffuse
form also benefit from care at these centers because their management
and the decision to pursue intensive medical therapy or a near-­total
pancreatectomy are complex.
The second most common form of congenital HI is caused by dominant activating pathogenic variants of GLUD1, which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This protein regulates the first step of
amino acid–stimulated insulin secretion in the β-­cell. Children with
GDH-­HI or hyperinsulinism-­hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA)
have fasting hypoglycemia, significant protein-­
induced hypoglycemia, and elevated plasma ammonia concentration. Seizures, attention-­
deficit disorder, and learning disabilities also occur in this form of HI,
and these neurologic issues do not seem to correlate with the degree of
hypoglycemia or ammonia elevation. This form of HI responds well to
diazoxide.
Activating pathogenic variants of GCK, which encodes glucokinase, cause an autosomal dominant form of congenital HI. Glucokinase is the key enzyme triggering glucose-­mediated insulin secretion.
Children with GCK-­HI have fasting hypoglycemia of variable severity
and diazoxide responsiveness. Severe cases may require a near-­total
pancreatectomy.
Pathogenic variants in HNF4A and HNF1A, which encode the transcription factors hepatic nuclear factors 4-­alpha and 1-­alpha, cause a
dominant form of diazoxide-­responsive HI. These infants may be large
for gestational age and have high GIR requirements at birth. The HI
resolves within the first several years of life. However, some individuals experience progressive β-­cell failure and progress to an early-­onset
diabetes, known as maturity-­onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
Syndromes associated with HI are increasingly being recognized
(see Table 113.5). Beckwith-­Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), an imprinting disorder, is characterized by macroglossia, lateralized overgrowth,
omphalocele, and a predisposition to embryonal tumors (Fig. 113.7).
Hyperinsulinism occurs in approximately 50% of infants with BWS,
although most cases are mild and resolve within the first several weeks
of life. These cases are typically responsive to diazoxide. Children
with BWS caused by paternal uniparental isodisomy of 11p can have
severe and persistent HI, which does not respond to diazoxide and may

require a pancreatectomy. Other syndromes known to be associated
with HI include Kabuki, Turner, and Rubinstein-­Taybi. HI in these
syndromes presents with variable degrees of severity and responsiveness to diazoxide.
After establishing a diagnosis of HI, a trial of diazoxide, the first-­
line agent for the treatment of HI, should be undertaken (Fig. 113.8).
Diazoxide opens the KATP channel, inhibiting insulin secretion. Children are considered responsive to diazoxide if the cardinal feature
of HI, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, is corrected. This is assessed by
demonstrating that the child can maintain plasma glucose >70 mg/

dL both while feeding and during an overnight fast and/or plasma β-­
hydroxybutyrate concentration increases to >2 mmol/L before plasma
glucose decreases below 50-­60 mg/dL during fasting. Failure to respond
to diazoxide strongly suggests KATP-­HI, and those children require expedited genetic testing for ABCC8 and KCNJ11 to determine their risk for
focal HI. Thus the assessment of the response to diazoxide has important therapeutic and diagnostic implications.
Somatostatin analogs are used off-­label as second-­line agents
for the treatment of diazoxide-­unresponsive diffuse HI. Octreotide

tachyphylaxis. A long-­acting analog, lanreotide, is administrated
monthly in children greater than 1 year old and can be an effective
and more convenient alternative to octreotide. Somatostatin analogs should not be used in neonates or infants less than 2 months
old because they are associated with fulminant necrotizing enterocolitis. Continuous intragastric dextrose administered via gastrostomy tube is used in combination with a somatostatin analog and
allows for an age-­appropriate feeding schedule.

Infants Born to Diabetic Mothers

See Chapter 147.1.
Gestational diabetes affects approximately 2% of pregnant
women, and 1 in 1,000 pregnant women have insulin-­dependent
diabetes. Infants born to mothers with poorly controlled diabetes
are born large for gestational age and with severe hypoglycemia
resulting from a transient hyperinsulinemic state. Exposed to high
glucose concentrations, the fetal islets compensate with increased
insulin secretion that, during intrauterine life, leads to overgrowth and, after birth, results in hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemia

resolves within the first 3-­7 days of life. Mothers whose diabetes
has been well controlled during pregnancy, labor, and delivery generally have infants near normal size who are less likely to develop
hypoglycemia.

Insulinoma

Older children and adolescents presenting with insulin-­
mediated
hypoglycemia should be evaluated for an insulinoma, a rare islet cell
tumor. These tumors may be insidious, slow growing, and difficult
to localize with conventional imaging modalities. Surgical resection
is curative. Children diagnosed with an insulinoma should undergo
genetic testing for the tumor predisposition syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).

Factitious Hypoglycemia

Surreptitious administration of insulin presents with abrupt onset
and erratic hypoglycemia. In a younger child, a parent or guardian
may provoke hypoglycemia (factitious disorder imposed on another:
Munchhausen by proxy), but an adolescent may be self-­administering
insulin. The biochemical hallmark of exogenous insulin administration is a detectable insulin level with undetectable c-­peptide. However,
specialized assays may be needed to detect the analog insulins, such
as aspart or glargine. Intentional or accidental ingestion of sulfonylureas also presents with hypoglycemia. In these cases, both insulin and
c-­peptide are detectable, and sulfonylurea blood levels are required for
confirmation.

Defects of Fatty Acid Oxidation

Fatty acid oxidation disorders are characterized by low plasma β-­
hydroxybutyrate and high plasma FFAs. See Chapter 106.1.
Multiple enzymatic deficiencies in the mitochondria pathway of
fatty acid oxidation cause defective carnitine or fatty acid metabolism.
These disorders are characterized by fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, and hypotonia, although the spectrum of
severity is wide. Infants may present with a Reye-­like syndrome (see

Fig. 113.5 Diagrammatic representation of β-­cell function. Genetic defects associated with congenital HI are included in red. Postprandial glucose is
taken into the β-­cells via the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-­2). Glucose then enters the glycolysis pathway followed by the mitochondrial citric acid cycle
(TCA), yielding the high-­energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP molecules travel to and inhibit the potassium-­dependent ATP channels
(KATP), which prevents influx of potassium resulting in membrane depolarization. This triggers voltage-­gated calcium channels to open, and influx of
calcium (Ca2+) occurs. The Ca2+ activates the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC) to produce inositol 1,3,5 triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from
phosphatidyl 1,3 bisphosphate (PIP2). The IP3 molecule binds to the protein receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to promote a release of Ca2+
from the ER. This subsequent increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ promotes exocytosis of the prepackaged mature insulin and active C-­peptide, which are

Chapter 409) and recurrent episodes of fasting hypoglycemia, cardiorespiratory arrest, and coma, whereas older children with less severe
forms may only develop symptoms with illness. Most cases are detected
via newborn screening and confirmed with genetic testing. Abnormalities are seen in the acylcarnitine and urine organic acid profiles in children who are not identified through newborn screening. Treatment
typically involves avoidance of fasting and administration of dextrose-­
containing fluids with illness.
Interference with fatty acid metabolism also underlies the fasting hypoglycemia associated with Jamaican vomiting sickness. In
Jamaican vomiting sickness, the unripe ackee fruit contains a water-­
soluble toxin, hypoglycin, which produces vomiting, CNS depression,
and severe hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemic activity of hypoglycin
derives from its inhibition of gluconeogenesis secondary to its interference with the acyl-­CoA and carnitine metabolism essential for
the oxidation of long-­chain fatty acids. The disease is almost totally
confined to Jamaica, where ackee forms a staple of the diet. The ripe
ackee fruit no longer contains this toxin. A similar illness noted in
India, acute toxic encephalopathy-­hypoglycemic syndrome, may be
caused by litchi consumption. Litchi contains hypoglycin A and/or
methylenecyclopropylglycine, which may inhibit fatty acid oxidation
or gluconeogenesis.

KETOTIC HYPOGLYCEMIC DISORDERS

failure to thrive. Muscle involvement is a feature of GSD type III, resulting
in proximal muscle weakness and risk of cardiomyopathy. GSD types 0, VI,
and IX present with less severe hypoglycemia compared with type I and III.
The diagnosis of GSD is suspected in patients presenting with ketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and liver enzyme abnormalities and is confirmed
through genetic testing. The treatment of GSDs consists of uncooked cornstarch therapy, protein supplementation, and limited fasting.

Hormone Deficiencies

Deficiencies of cortisol or growth hormone can result in ketotic hypoglycemia, as these counter-­regulatory hormones play a role in mobilizing glucose production by the liver. Hypoglycemia occurs in both
primary or secondary (central) adrenal insufficiency and is commonly
seen during an adrenal crisis. Growth hormone deficiency results in
hypoglycemia mainly during infancy and early toddlerhood. Combined hormone deficiencies, known as hypopituitarism, can also result

in hypoglycemia and are commonly caused by structural abnormalities
of the pituitary gland. A clinical clue to the diagnosis of hypopituitarism is the presence of midline defects, cleft lip or palate, or in males,
a microphallus. In the neonatal period, hypopituitarism presents with
a hypoketotic hypoglycemia pattern that is indistinguishable from the
pattern seen in neonates with HI. Thus in neonates with features suggestive of hypopituitarism, it is important to rule out hormone deficiencies before making a diagnosis of HI.
Low cortisol and growth hormone levels on a critical-­sample laboratory result are suggestive of hormone deficiencies but not diagnostic.
To confirm these diagnoses in a child presenting with hypoglycemia,
appropriate hormone stimulation testing is recommended. A child
diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency, growth hormone deficiency, or hypopituitarism requires magnetic resonance imaging of
their pituitary gland to assess for structural abnormalities or lesions.
Hormone replacement with either hydrocortisone or growth hormone

Chapter 113 u Hypoglycemia
resolves the hypoglycemia. Neonates and infants require twice-­a-­day
growth hormone dosing to prevent ongoing hypoglycemia.

Idiopathic Ketotic Hypoglycemia

Idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia (IKH) commonly occurs during
the first 1-­4 years of life and typically resolves by age 6-­8 years old.
Children present with hypoglycemia and elevated β-­hydroxybutyrate
(>2-­3 mmol/L), frequently in the setting of illness, and demonstrate
shortened fasting tolerance on a diagnostic fast. IKH is a diagnosis of
exclusion, and it is important to rule out other causes of ketotic hypoglycemia, such as GSDs or hormone deficiencies, before making this
diagnosis. IKH is likely the result of the lower energy stores in toddlers and young children and is not caused by an underlying metabolic
defect, as evidenced by its spontaneous resolution (see Table 113.9).
Treatment typically consists of limited fasting time and home glucose monitoring during times of illness. IV dextrose infusion may be
required with illness if children are unable to tolerate oral feeds.

Disorders of Gluconeogenesis

Disorders of gluconeogenesis are characterized by elevated plasma lactate levels during hypoglycemia.

Glycogen Storage Disease Type I

See Chapter 107.1.
Glucose-­6-­phosphatase regulates the terminal step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and deficiency of this enzyme results in GSD
type I. Children with this condition experience hypoglycemia within
2-­3 hours after a meal and significant elevations of lactate, uric acid,
and triglycerides because of shunting of gluconeogenic precursors to
alternative pathways in the liver. The diagnosis should be suspected
in an infant with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and the characteristic
metabolic abnormalities. Sequencing of G6PC (type Ia) or SLC37A4
(type Ib) confirms the diagnosis. Treatment includes frequent meals
or feeds and after the first 6-­12 months of life, uncooked cornstarch
administered every 3-­4 hours. Fasting beyond 4-­6 hours can provoke
life-­threatening lactic acidosis.

Fructose-­1,6-­Bisphosphatase Deficiency

See Chapter 107.3.
A deficiency of this enzyme results in a block of gluconeogenesis from
all possible precursors below the level of fructose-­1,6-­bisphosphate.
Features are similar to GSD type I with fasting hypoglycemia, severe
lactic acidosis, and elevations of uric acid and triglycerides. However,
glycogenolysis remains intact, so patients do not have significant hepatomegaly or transaminitis. The diagnosis is confirmed through genetic
testing of FBP1. Similar to GSD type I, treatment involves frequent
meals, cornstarch, and avoidance of prolonged fasting.

OTHER CAUSES OF HYPOGLYCEMIA
Postprandial Hypoglycemia

Up to 30% of infants and children with Nissen fundoplication, a procedure used to ameliorate gastroesophageal reflux, develop postprandial
hypoglycemia, or “late dumping syndrome.” Characteristic features
include hyperglycemia followed by severe hypoglycemia (average 32

991

mg/dL in one series) 1.5-­3 hours later. The early hyperglycemia phase is
associated with brisk and excessive insulin release that causes the resultant hypoglycemia. A role for exaggerated GLP-­1 secretion has been
proposed as being responsible for the excessive insulin release. Treatment consists of feed modifications for formula-­or tube-­fed children,
such as the use of complex formulas or prolonged feeds. Acarbose has
been successfully used in some orally fed children.

Acute Alcohol Intoxication

The generation of reducing equivalents during the oxidation of ethanol in
the liver inhibits several gluconeogenic enzymes, resulting in hypoglycemia if glycogen stores are depleted by starvation or by preexisting abnormalities in glycogen metabolism. There is no correlation between blood
ethanol levels and the occurrence of hypoglycemia. In toddlers who have
been fasting for some time, even the consumption of small quantities
of alcohol can precipitate hypoglycemia. Alcohol-­induced hypoglycemia
promptly responds to IV dextrose. However, if there is an associated alcohol
toxicity, the patient may not show clinical signs of improvement despite
now having a normal blood glucose level. A careful history allows the diagnosis to be made and may avoid additional workup.

β Blockers

β-­Adrenergic stimulation enhances glucagon secretion and increases
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. β blockers impair the counter-­
regulatory response to hypoglycemia and blunt the autonomic symptoms described earlier. Children at highest risk of hypoglycemia from β
blockers include those with insulin-­dependent diabetes and infants and
toddlers in the setting of prolonged fasting or illness. Despite increased
use of propranolol for infantile hemangiomas, the prevalence of hypoglycemia in this population appears to be low (0.9%). Propranolol has
also been safely used in children with underlying hypoglycemia disorders, although close monitoring of glucose is needed during illness.

Salicylate Intoxication

See Chapter 94.
Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia occur in children with
salicylate intoxication. Accelerated use of glucose, resulting from augmentation of insulin secretion by salicylates, and possible interference
with gluconeogenesis may contribute to hypoglycemia. Infants are
more susceptible than older children. Monitoring of blood glucose
levels with appropriate glucose infusion in the event of hypoglycemia
should form part of the therapeutic approach to salicylate intoxication
in childhood. Ketosis may occur.

Systemic Disorders

Several systemic disorders are associated with hypoglycemia in infants
and children. Children with acute liver failure develop hypoglycemia
because of loss of gluconeogenesis. Sepsis, particularly in neonates,
may result in hypoglycemia. Falciparum malaria is also associated with
hypoglycemia, which is thought to be the result of increased glucose
use and impaired gluconeogenesis.
