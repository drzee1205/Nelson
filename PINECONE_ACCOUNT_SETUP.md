# 🔧 Pinecone Account Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue

Your Pinecone account (Project: `uys8fsh`) has a **pod limit of 0**, which prevents creating any indexes. This is common with certain account types.

## 💡 Solutions (Choose One)

1. **Go to Pinecone Console**: https://app.pinecone.io/
2. **Navigate to Billing**: Click on your project → Billing/Settings

   - **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for larger needs

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Unlimited indexes
- ✅ 5M+ vectors
- ✅ Production-ready performance
- ✅ Priority support

### Option 2: Request Free Tier Access
